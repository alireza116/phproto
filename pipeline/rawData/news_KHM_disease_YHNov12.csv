Pro-democracy protesters raise their hands in a three-fingered salute during a rally to demand the government to resign, to dissolve the parliament and to hold new elections under a revised constitution, near the Democracy Monument in Bangkok, Thailand, August 16, 2020. REUTERS/Jorge Silva  Some protesters are also pushing for reforms to the monarchy -- until recently a taboo subject.  HOW DID THE PROTESTS START?  Anti-government protests first emerged late last year after courts banned Future Forward, the most vocal party opposing the government of former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha and one that drew strong support among Thai youths.  The protests went largely online while curbs were in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but re-emerged in mid-July. Since then, demonstrations organised by student groups have taken place almost daily.  There was strong student representation at the protest on Sunday, but there were also many older people among the crowds.  WHAT ARE THE PROTESTERS DEMANDING?  The are three key demands: For Prayuth’s government to step down, for a new constitution to be drawn up and for an end to the harassment of opposition activists.  But some students have also presented 10 demands for reforms to the powerful monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.  These include curbs on his constitutional powers as well as his authority over the palace fortune and armed forces. They also want an end to the monarchy’s role in politics, but emphasise they are not seeking to abolish it.  Such public demands for change by any group are unprecedented in living memory.  WHAT IS DRIVING THE GRIEVANCES?  Opponents of Prayuth accuse him of maintaining the power he first seized in a 2014 coup through an election last year that was held under rules that favoured him. He disputes this.  Other factors have also emerged, including anger over accusations of government corruption and a feeling that the Thai elite acts with impunity. Meanwhile, poverty has been exacerbated by the collapse of the crucial tourist industry as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.  The disappearance of a Thai anti-government activist in Cambodia, the latest of nine to go missing in recent years, has fuelled disaffection.  Many young Thais also voice frustration with an establishment that emphasises obedience to authorities and tradition, with the monarchy described by the constitution as “enthroned in a position of revered worship”.  HOW HAS THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED?  The government has said that people are allowed to show dissent and Prayuth has said he seeks dialogue with the protesters.  But three student protest leaders have already been arrested and released on bail on charges over the earlier protests, and police say there are warrants for the arrest of a further 12.  Prayuth has said the king has requested him not to use the lese majeste laws that provide for up to 15 years in prison for anyone insulting the monarchy.  WHAT OPPOSITION IS THERE TO THE PROTESTERS?  There have been a handful of pro-monarchy demonstrations to counter the anti-government protests, but even the biggest has drawn no more than a few dozen people.  Those have included former members of the strongly royalist yellow shirts, who for more than a decade before the last coup had clashed with red shirt protesters loyal to former populist prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.  Some former red shirts have meanwhile appeared at the anti-government protests.  This has stirred concerns in Thailand that there could be a return to the street violence of the past, although so far the protests have been peaceful.  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?  Protesters have vowed to continue taking action until their demands are met.  The protests, and particularly the criticism of the monarchy, have put the government in a bind.  Political analysts have said that if it acts too harshly, it risks provoking a backlash that will further encourage support for the protests. If it does not take strong action, however, the protesters may be further emboldened to break longstanding taboos."

The deal values Netmeds around Rs 1,000 crore.  The acquisition gives RIL’s retail unit Reliance Retail entry into a vertical e-commerce space, one of the few that has soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to its online grocery platform JioMart.  Founded by Pradeep Dadha, Netmeds currently delivers medicines, personal and baby care items, and provides doctor bookings and diagnostics on its website and app. It has been looking for a buyer for nearly a year now, after it was unable to raise a large round of funding.  Its investors include Singapore-based Daun Penh Cambodia Group, Sistema Asia Fund, Tanncam Investment and healthcare-focused investment firm OrbiMed.  Listen: Setting Sail podcast | Wow Momo may cut jobs in September, business still not back to pre-Covid level: Sagar Daryani  Isha Ambani, Director, Reliance Retail Ventures, said in a statement, “The addition of Netmeds enhances Reliance Retail’s ability to provide good quality and affordable healthcare products and services, and also broadens its digital commerce proposition to include most daily essential needs of consumers.”  A scrum of startups have fiercely fought in e-pharmacies for a few years now on the thesis that delivering medicines for chronic illnesses regularly could be a springboard to becoming a large internet company. Netmeds, PharmEasy, Medlife, 1mg, etc have been jostling for space. However, margins in medicine delivery are minimal, and investors will not fund money-losing startups unless they are market leaders.  The pandemic however turned this notion on its head. The segment has benefited from many first-time customers flocking to these apps as they were forced to order medicines from home during lockdown. Moneycontrol reported on August 7 that these apps have seen orders surge 50 percent and taken the sector forward by two years in the last three months.  According to people close to the deal, although RIL was eyeing the sector, and Netmeds, even before the pandemic hit, the lockdown helped close the deal, find the right valuation and proved the business thesis.  Last week, Amazon India rolled out its e-pharmacy service in Bengaluru, with plans to launch in the rest of the country soon.  The entry of these conglomerates, to some extent, gives the sector long-term prospects. Barring PharmEasy, every other startup in the sector has been battling for survival, struggling to raise funds and been eyeing mergers with larger rivals.  “It is a good outcome for both sides. Netmeds needed to survive and find a home. RIL wanted to enter the sector, but not pay a very high tech-style valuation,” said an investor in the space, requesting anonymity.  The deal fuels Jio’s desire to have a full-fledged ecommerce platform, delivering goods of all kinds. Acquiring distressed startups has been a step in this direction. It is reportedly in talks to acquire online furniture startup Urban Ladder, online lingerie retailer Zivame and online milk delivery startup Milkbasket.  Reliance Industries (RIL), which also controls Jio Platforms, is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments which publishes Moneycontrol."

The programme has already drawn in $1.5 billion worth of investment pledges – from electronics players like Samsung, Wistron and Foxconn, who have promised mobile phone manufacturing units in the country.  Besides incentives for electronics and pharmaceutical sectors, incentives for textile, automobile, food processing sectors are also in the works, Bloomberg reported. As per the PLI scheme, niche firms will be eligible for payment of 4-6 percent of their incremental sales over the next five years.  India’s decision came as firms made to shift sole dependence on China amid trade tensions with the United States and the coronavirus pandemic. Admittedly, gains so far have not been big as Vietnam remains the most preferred destination, followed by Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand, a Standard Chartered survey found.  COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show  But experts feel India has “reasonable chance over the medium term, in terms of incremental investment of supply chains in the country.”  “These programs are aimed at increasing India’s manufacturing share in the gross domestic product,” Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG – Mumbai told the publication.  The electronics sector pledges so far alone could shift an additional 10 percent of global smartphone production – most from China, to India by 2025, analysts at Credit Suisse said. The exercise could bring in $55 billion additional investments over five years – a 0.5 percent addition to India’s economic output, they added."

SINGAPORE: COVID-19 has claimed more than 700,000 lives, infected over 19 million people, and decimated rich and poor economies alike.  But, even as most of the world faces unprecedented recession, policy responses differ sharply. The contrast between Europe and Asia is a case in point.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Both regions are undoubtedly facing serious economic hardship. The European Commission expects the eurozone economy – which grew by 1.3 per cent in 2019 – to contract by 8.7 per cent this year.  In the ASEAN+3 – the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam), plus China, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea – GDP growth is expected to plunge to 0 per cent this year, from 4.8 per cent in 2019.  Advertisement  Advertisement  DIFFERENT SUPPORT MEASURES  Policymakers in both regions have responded aggressively, with unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus, as well as other measures to support the economy.  But different economic structures, institutional arrangements and vulnerabilities mean that the size, content and distribution of support have been very different.  In the European Union, fiscal rules – particularly the stricture that a budget deficit cannot exceed 3 per cent of GDP – were temporarily suspended, to give countries more space for expansionary fiscal policy.  Advertisement  Of course, significant differences in countries’ fiscal and financial space remain, so the size of the stimulus varies widely by country – from about 50 per cent of GDP in Italy to a few percentage points in other countries, like Ireland.  People walk at Piazza del Popolo, after Italy opened its borders to European countries allowing free movement after the coronavirus lockdown, in Rome, Italy. (REUTERS/Yara Nardi)  In the ASEAN+3, the range is narrower, but not by much. Japan’s stimulus is the largest, at 40 per cent of GDP, while the other economies come in at around 10 per cent of GDP.  All told, fiscal measures, together with indirect financial measures (such as debt moratoriums), amount to nearly 29 per cent of GDP in the eurozone, and 13 per cent of GDP in the ASEAN+3.  SUPPORT FOR FIRMS AND WORKERS  Differences in the size of the crisis response can be explained partly by the extent to which guarantees have been used to support firms.  In the eurozone, discretionary budgetary measures worth 5.3 per cent of GDP are backed by liquidity facilities totaling almost 21 per cent of GDP.  Those facilities consist of public guarantee schemes – which channel liquidity through the banking system into the economy.  The ASEAN+3 economies have pursued discretionary fiscal measures on a similar scale – 5.1 per cent of GDP, on average – but backed by liquidity-support schemes averaging just 5 per cent of GDP (including temporary debt relief and moratoriums).  The magnitude of tax and social-contribution deferrals is comparable in the eurozone and the ASEAN+3.  Both regions have also taken steps to support household income, though here, too, structural differences have translated into contrasting approaches. Eurozone economies have favoured job-retention schemes, via short-time work compensation – partly a reflection of the region’s robust social security systems.

(Photo: REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan)  In many ASEAN+3 economies – which despite their economic heterogeneity, tend to have larger informal economies, more flexible labour markets, and weaker social safety nets – direct income-support schemes have proved effective.  Moreover, automatic stabilisers – such as taxation and the extension of unemployment coverage and social benefits – have played a much larger role in the eurozone, where they amount to about 5 per cent of GDP. In most ASEAN+3 economies, such stabilisers are estimated to total 1.1 per cent of GDP.  COMPLEMENTARY EU POLICIES  Another notable difference is institutional: In Europe, unlike in the ASEAN+3, existing structures allowed for complementary policy initiatives at the regional level.  Even before the EU launched its unprecedented €750 billion (US$886 billion) recovery fund, finance ministers had agreed to three programs worth a total of €540 billion.  First, the European Commission’s Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) can provide up to €100 billion of loans under favourable terms to member states.  Second, the European Investment Bank is available to support businesses by mobilising up to €200 billion.  Finally, the European Stability Mechanism’s Pandemic Crisis Support credit line supports spending on health care and preventive measures during the COVID-19 crisis, up to €240 billion.  Of course, the eurozone’s integrated structure also creates risks – particularly if the COVID-19 crisis fuels destabilising divergence among member economies. Some eurozone-wide initiatives – including the recovery fund – aim to mitigate this risk.  DIFFERENCES IN MONETARY POLICY  There are also notable differences in approach on the monetary policy front. In emerging and developing economies, central banks have focused on cutting policy rates and injecting liquidity.  FILE PHOTO: The European Central Bank logo. Frankfurt, Germany, January 23, 2020. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo  Key measures among ASEAN+3 economies have included government guarantees on select bank-lending activities, temporary financing lines, and corporate-bond purchases.  Moreover, regulatory forbearance encourages well-capitalised banking sectors to provide some relief to borrowers.  By contrast, central banks in advanced economies had little space to lower interest rates, so they have leaned heavily on quantitative easing.  The European Central Bank expanded its €120 billion asset-purchase program and created a new temporary €750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, which it subsequently increased by €600 billion.  LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY  The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the way structural differences, institutional frameworks, and the extent to which governments and financial systems have built up buffers shape crisis responses. But short-term emergency action is just the beginning.  It is impossible to say how the COVID-19 crisis will unfold. New waves of infection may necessitate renewed lockdowns, impede or even reverse economic recovery, and intensify fiscal pressures. Additional stimulus measures may be needed.  Even if the virus is brought under control relatively quickly, the road to recovery will be long.  In Europe and Asia alike, policymakers must begin considering how to translate emergency measures into more sustainable policies. Their approaches may not be the same, but their objectives – safeguarding their economies’ long-term prospects – should be.

The country has recorded a total of 3,378 cases and 58 deaths, and is reporting single-digit new cases most days.  While Thailand remains closed to international visitors, the beautiful island of Koh Samui is proposing a way to welcome international tourists. However, there are so many restrictions that I almost feel like they shouldn’t even bother…  Koh Samui’s plans for international tourists  The Bangkok Post is reporting on a proposal by the President of the Tourism Association of Koh Samui, who will be meeting with Thailand’s Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) to propose a plan to restart tourism in Koh Samui.  As mentioned above, Thailand is closed to international tourists, but the hope is that Koh Samui can reopen tourism with precautions, given that it’s an island separated from the rest of the country.  The Ritz-Carlton Koh Samui  Koh Samui’s plan for restarting international tourism is extremely cautious, to the point that I think a vast majority of visitors will be deterred from visiting. With this proposal:  Travelers would need to arrive in Thailand on Thai Airways  Upon arrival at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport, passengers would have to be tested for coronavirus; there would be no immigration in Bangkok, since you’d be continuing to Koh Samui, and would clear formalities there  After arriving in Koh Samui you’d undergo another coronavirus test  Regardless of the results, you’d have to stay in your room for seven days  After seven days you’d be allowed to enjoy the resort you’re staying at, but wouldn’t be allowed to leave  Only after 14 days would you be allowed to leave your resort, and you’d need a special wristband when traveling around  The President of the Tourism Association of Koh Samui is calling on airlines to lower fares to Koh Samui to attract travelers. Given the limited service to the airport, fares tend to be high, so the hope is that these fares can be lowered to attract travelers.  Perhaps the bigger issue is that Thai Airways is currently operating virtually no international flights, so getting international travelers to Thailand isn’t easy in the first place.  Thai Airways is being asked to lower fares for visitors  The various paths to restarting tourism  We’ve seen popular tourist destinations take all kinds of different approaches to restarting tourism (or not restarting tourism, as the case may be):  On one end of the spectrum you have Turkey, which is welcoming just about everyone, with no testing requirement of any sort  Some places are opening with extreme precautions; look at Cambodia, for example, which has restrictions that would deter just about anyone from visiting  Then you have countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Thailand, which are keeping borders closed  Turkey has opened to visitors with few restrictions  It seems like an impossible task to decide what the right approach is towards tourism:  I respect places that choose to keep borders closed and make it clear they don’t yet want tourists  At the same time, for those places allowing visitors but only with extreme restrictions (like what Koh Samui is proposing), I wouldn’t expect that to do much to restart tourism  It can be hard to figure out what the right approach should be. For example, when Hawaii was thinking or requiring pre-travel testing (which is now being postponed), the belief was that testing before travel would prevent 80-90% of coronavirus cases.  Hawaii is postponing its tourism restart  A strategy like that would obviously still lead to an increase in coronavirus cases, but how do you balance that with people being allowed to return to their jobs? Is it worth preventing those 10-20% of cases by adding restrictions that may very well deter a vast majority of tourists from visiting?  On the other end of the spectrum you have Turkey, which has opened up with no restrictions, and hasn’t seen a spike in reported cases. How would case numbers look different if the country did do mandatory testing at the border?  I think there’s no right or wrong answer here. I do think that Koh Samui’s plan would prevent a vast majority of travelers from considering the island. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though…  Bottom line  Thailand’s borders have been closed for months. While there’s no end in sight for that, Koh Samui is hoping to once again welcome international visitors, but with lots of restrictions.  Koh Samui’s plans seem safe, in the sense that two tests and a 7-14 day quarantine should catch nearly all potential cases. At the same time, this might be so restrictive that it would deter a vast majority of visitors.  What do you make of Koh Samui’s tourism revival plan?"

Her eldest son started university last year at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, but now, with the global health crisis wreaking havoc, the college has been forced to close and courses will continue online.  'He had to stay back from Korea,' the 45-year-old actress said of her 19-year-old son.

We’re lucky.'  The Oscar-winning actress adopted Maddox in his native Cambodia when he was just seven months old in 2002.  She is also mom to Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 15, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 12.  Maddox returned to the US in March with a source telling Us Weekly at the time that the teen planned to focus on his Korean and Russian studies until school reopened.

Angelina shares her kids with ex-husband Brad Pitt who she was in a relationship with for a decade before they got married in 2014.  They were declared legally divorced in April 2019, but parts of their case remain unresolved.  Angelina filed a request to remove Judge John W. Ouderkirk from their almost four-year-long divorce battle last week, claiming that Ouderkirk - who married the former couple at their French estate Château Miraval in 2014 - failed to disclose other 'business relationships' he had with Pitt's lawyers, suggesting that he would be 'biased' in their divorce case.  Angelina is also mom to Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 15, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 12. Pictured here with her kids in 2018  Pitt, 56, responded in papers filed on August 13, calling Jolie's filing a 'Hail Mary' - an American Football reference to deliberately delay a game - according to legal documents obtained by PEOPLE.  Pitt's legal team accuses the actress of making a 'transparently tactical gambit' to delay matters, adding that it will be their own children who are 'hurt most' by the hold up.  Jolie and Pitt, like other high-profile couples, are paying for a private judge in their divorce case to keep many of its filings and the personal and financial details within them sealed, though some legal moves must be made within standard court procedure.  Their custody trial is currently set for October, though it remains to be seen how long proceedings will now be delayed following Jolie's latest filing.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in March announced incentives that make niche firms -- electronics manufacturers -- eligible for a payment of 4%-6% of their incremental sales over the next five years. The result: about two dozen companies pledged $1.5 billion of investments to set up mobile-phone factories in the country.  Besides Samsung, those that have shown interest are Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known as Foxconn, Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. India has also extended similar incentives to the pharmaceutical sector, and plans to cover more sectors, which may include automobiles, textiles, and food processing under the program.  While companies have been actively looking to diversify supply chains amid the US-China trade tensions and the coronavirus outbreak, it hasn’t yet translated into big gains for India despite the nation making it cheaper for businesses to open shop. Vietnam remains the most favoured destination, followed by Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand, according to a recent survey by Standard Chartered Plc.  “There is a reasonable chance for India to gain in terms of incremental investment of supply chains within the country over the medium term,” said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Mumbai. “These programs are aimed at increasing India’s manufacturing share in the gross domestic product.”  Economic Boost  The government expects the program for electronics alone could lead to $153 billion worth of manufactured goods over the next five years and create about one million jobs directly and indirectly.  This would bring an additional investment of $55 billion over five years, adding 0.5% to India’s economic output, according to analysts led by Neelkanth Mishra at Credit Suisse Group AG. This could shift an additional 10% of global smart-phone production to India in five years, most of it from China, they wrote in a report Aug. 10.  That complements Modi’s goal to grow the share of manufacturing in the economy to 25% from the current around 15% as part of his ‘Make in India’ program. His government has already lowered taxes on companies to among the lowest in Asia, seeking to attract new investments in an economy headed for its first contraction in more than four decades this year.  The latest output-linked incentive plan is a “big win for Make in India,” Amish Shah, an analyst at BofA Securities, said in a report to clients. He sees gains for industrials, cement, pharmaceuticals, metals and logistics, with long-term indirect benefits across many sectors."

Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you, operator. Good morning and good evening, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining our earnings call. With the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in China behind us, we made a faster than expected recovery as we benefited from the deeper and the wider trends of digitalization for merchants and the online shopping for consumers.  In the second quarter of 2020, we strategically targeted both top line growth and profitability, while enhancing efficiency across our business. As a result, we continue to gain healthy volume growth while lowering costs in our Express and Freight segments and improved our gross margin by 0.9 percentage points year-over-year, despite challenging market dynamics. We also continued to make strong progress in Store+, which resulted in a significant reduction in losses. We are confident that we have developed the right business model for Store+ that will bring a positive impact for the company revenue growth and the profitability.  Our momentum has also been strong for Global, driven by robust demand in Southeast Asia and further boosted by our entries into markets of Malaysia, Singapore and Cambodia during the second quarter.  Now, let me share some insights on the business. First, our core logistics and the supply chain units. Strategically, in line with our companywide pursuit of balanced top line growth and affordability. We continue to emphasize business integration, synergies and efficiencies. We promoted e-commerce related transactions across all business units and achieved a stronger business to consumer or the growth during the during the quarter. We also made progress on enhancement of service quality through strengthening network flexibility density of last mile service outlets, and finally, the overall consumer experience.  For Express, despite intensified market conditions, we have successfully in maintaining our position as one of the top tier players in the market. Through our continued efforts of cost reductions and the enhance quality of services, our parcel volume increased by 19.3% year-over-year to RMB2.3 billion, representing market share of 10.7% during the quarter. And improving 0.2 percentage point compared to the first quarter. We also achieved gross margin expansion of 0.9 percentage point year-over-year, as average cost per parcel decreased by 21.5% versus last year.  Going into the second half of 2020. We remain focused on increasing market share, investing in automation and further integrating dynamic routing with Freight to enhance operational efficiencies and improved profitability. Our freight business achieved great results in the second quarter, we continue to solidifying its leadership position and achieve the delivery volume of over 2.2 million tons, growing 28.9% year-over-year. Which was significantly higher than industry wide average.  Average cost per tons decreased by 21.1% year-over-year, leading to a stronger gross margin of 8.9%, a record high, and 2.5 percentage points higher compared to the same period last year. This was driven primarily our focus on e-commerce products, economy of scale and the continuous network optimization and the operating efficiency.  Let me provide a little bit more color on the LTL or less than truckload freight market and our positioning with its market. Overall, LTL is a larger market. Traditionally, the demand for LTL Freight service was primarily B2B for manufacturers and wholesalers. But since last year more demand has been e-commerce related. Our LTL services has experienced robust growth, driven by increasing more large size e-commerce products. Our network penetration into lower-tier cities to serve its strong consumption growth, as well as further market consolidation, Best has benefited top tier players such as Best Freight.  In the second half of 2020 we expect the Freight to continue to grow in the 30% range. We are also confidence we can continue to optimize our cost structure through economics of scale, automation and transportation cost reductions by working on areas, such as efficiency improvements of our hubs and sortation centers, while realizing additional synergies with our other business.  Moving to Best supply chain management. Strategically, we view it as a central component of our core supply chain and logistics units. And therefore, we'll continue deepening the integrated services model and promoting cross selling between unit -- business units. Operationally, we target expanding franchise of Cloud OFC business and the projects with a higher margins and clients with stronger credit profile. As a result, it's second quarter gross margin increased 0.8 percentage points year-over-year to 9.7%. The total number of orders fulfilled by Cloud OFC's increased by 28.5% year-over-year to RMB111.3 million in the second quarter, of which, total number of orders fulfilled by franchise Cloud OFCs increased by 46% year-over-year to 53.7%. The number of franchise OFCs increased by 25.9% year-over-year to RMB326 million.  Best Cargo, our fast growing online full truckload brokerage platform following the effort was started in the first quarter. We further expanded our brokerage model and added more small and mid-sized enterprises. The number of registered drivers on the UCargo mobile apps increased 141.9% year-over-year to over 244,000. Total number of transactions on the trucking brokerage platform increased by 19.8% year-over-year. We plan to bring many more drivers and SME directly onto the platform in coming quarters. And consequently further increase the number of transactions.  For BEST Store+, we continued our strategic initiative of transforming this unit to be more asset light by focusing on growing high-quality membership and franchise stores through a partnership model with strong -- with ongoing acceleration of businesses moving online, merchants and store owners have strong demand for digitization and the online business expansion, while improving the supply chain efficiency. Early this year, we started adopting the strategy to accelerate the growth of membership and franchise stores onto Store+ platform, while addressing the margin improvement and efficiency in fulfillment cost.  During the quarter our continued -- we continued to optimize the operation of our branded stores and refined our centralized procurement model in order to achieve a better cost structure and higher margins. As a result, as such, gross profit margin of Best Store+ improved by 2.2 percentage points year-over-year to 13% in the second quarter. We are confident that we have the right asset light model for Store+ that will bring a positive impact to our group's revenue growth and profitability.  For Best Global, we achieved a strong second quarter results driven by continued growth in Southeast Asia. Parcel volume in Thailand, increased by 95% quarter-over-quarter to approximate 10 million. While parcel volume in Vietnam increased by 54% quarter-over-quarter to 5.75 million, we also launched express delivery services in Malaysia, Cambodia and Singapore, marking another significant step forward in building an efficient logistics network with extensive coverage in Southeast Asia.  Looking ahead, we are committed to delivering high-quality growth in a challenging market environment. We will maintain a balancing -- balanced growth strategy and strive for profitability by continuing leveraging our technology enabled integrated supply chain and larger services model, through emphasizing e-commerce, investing in technology application and automation, capturing revenue and cost synergies across multiple business units, enhancing service quarter.  Now I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Gloria, to walk you through our second quarter financials. Thank you.  Gloria Fan -- Chief Financial Officer  Thank you. Johnny. And hello to everyone. As Johnny clearly laid out, we delivered a solid quarter through operational excellence and execution with a difficult macro environment and intense competition of the industry. As we progress through this period of great economic uncertainty we have ample liquidity, strong balance sheet and a keen focus on cost management.  I will now provide a brief review of our second quarter 2020 financial results. Given the limited time on today's call, I will be presenting some abbreviating the financial highlights. I encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. We focused our efforts on sustainable growth during the second quarter. While our revenue contracted slightly by 4% year-over-year, we achieved non-GAAP net income of RMB11 million, higher than RMB6.5 million in the same period of 2019. Excluding the interest expense of convertible bonds, our non-GAAP net income would have been over RMB20 million.  Our gross margin was 6.8%, an increase of 0.9 percentage point year-over-year due to improved operating efficiency, which resulted in continued cost reduction. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 was RMB158 million, compared to RMB148 million of the same period of 2010. Q2 adjusted EBITDA for core logistics and the supply chain business was RMB291 million, compared to RMB298 million for the same period of 2019. Additionally, we generated a net operating cash flow of over RMB700 million during Q2, compared to the RMB334 million of the same period of 2018. As we recovered from COVID-19 and our Express and Freight volumes has grown -- has grown significantly from Q1 2020.  Our robust cash flow from operations led to a strong balance -- balance of cash and cash equivalents with restricted cash and short term investment of RMB5.1 billion, which provides us a solid financial position for future growth.  Next, moving onto key financial highlights for our business unit. On year-over-year basis, Q2 revenue for Best Express decreased by 5% to RMB5.2 billion, primarily due to a 21% decrease in average selling price per parcel, offset by a 19% increase in cost of volume. The drop in ASP was due to competitive market dynamics. The cost per parcel decreased by 21% mainly due to improved operating efficiency and network optimization, which resulted in lower last mile, transportation, labor, lease and other costs. Adjusted EBITDA for Best Express was RMB189 million, compared to RMB216 million for the same period of last year.  Best Freight Q2 revenue increased by 4.5% to RMB1.4 billion, primarily due to a 29% increase of Freight volume and offset by a 19% decrease of ASP per ton. Adjusted EBITDA for Best Freight was RMB73 million RMB, which was more than doubled compared to RMB31 million for the same period of last year. Q2 revenue for Best supply chain management decreased by 50% to RMB510 million, primarily due to a decrease in transportation service revenue as we strategically target higher margin customers. Adjusted EBITDA for Best supply chain management was RMB5.7 million, compared to RMB14.4 million for the same period of last year.  BEST UCargo's Q2 revenue decreased by 6% to RMB493 million due to a shift from key account to small and media enterprise business. Adjusted EBITDA for Best Ucargo was negative RMB17.5 million, compared to positive RMB5 million for the same period of last year.  BEST Capital's revenue decreased by 13% compared to Q2 2019, due to our more stringent credit control policy. Its adjusted EBITDA was RMB41 million, compared to RMB32 million in the same period of last year. Store+ revenue decreased by 17% to RMB657 million, primarily due to ongoing efforts to enhance order quality to improve margin. Adjusted EBITDA loss for Store+ was RMB67 million, which was significantly lower compared to a loss of RMB102 million for the same period of last year.  Q2 revenue for Best Global was RMB193 million, almost tripling from the same period of last year as we continue our strong growth momentum in Southeast Asia. Adjusted EBITDA for Best Global was negative RMB48 million, compared to negative RMB32 million for the same period of last year, as we continue our investment to ramp up operations in Thailand and Vietnam. And to launch our network in Malaysia, Cambodia and in Singapore,  Next, let's look at major operating expense items. Compared to the same quarter of 2019 selling, general and administrative expenses increased by RMB28 million to RMB519 million. The increase was primarily attributable to losses on disposal of fixed assets due to upgrade of our expenses equipment. R&D expenses decreased by RMB12 million to RMB48 million, which was primarily attributable to capitalization of certain R&D expenditure to intangible assets, as well as reduction in travel expenses.  Please note, all of these expenses excluded share-based compensation. We will continue to optimize our SG&A and R&D expenses to improve our operating efficiency and we expect further benefit from operating leverage as our business grows.  Capex in the second quarter was RMB424 million or 5% of total revenue, compared to RMB381 or 4% of total revenue for the same period of last year. In addition, we are working on cost improvement programs to streamline capex and reduce expenses. Our results in Q2 demonstrated that through consistently improving operating efficiency and expense management we can well achieve balancing top line growth and the profitability. Despite this period of economic uncertainty we are well positioned to grow our business and continue to drive value creation for our shareholders.  With that, we will now open the call to Q&A. Thank you.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you for joining the call. So we can open to Q&A right now.  Questions and Answers:  Operator  Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma'am. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question we have will come from Baoying Zhai of Citi.  Baoying Zhai -- Citigroup -- Analyst  Hi, good morning Johnny, and Gloria, congratulations on the strong second quarter results. I have two questions. First is regarding the second quarter results on the Freight segment. I noticed a very strong transportation cost control in the second quarter. So wondering besides the tailwinds from the toll waiver and the lower fuel costs. What's the other reason behind is the transportation cost coming down so much? Is it because of the product mix leading to the latter average rate or anything else, because it's now almost 30% year-on-year in second quarter?  And my second question is regarding the competition strategy in the -- for the Express segment because we were intentionally are slowing down a little bit in terms of the volume growth for better profitability and business sustainability. But looking forward, we are seeing more new entrants come into the battlefield. So what's our current strategy? We still put the profit ahead of market share now or we are shifting our strategy to grabbing more market share in the next few quarters? Thank you.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you, Baoying. Thank you very much for good questions. With regarding to Freight. Yeah. So second quarter we actually benefited from multiple front, right? One is that, like, as you said, fuel pricing and also the government policy at the early year to combating the COVID-19 has waived the tolls for the highway. Even though on the only benefit in April or few days of May, but that does give us a good cost reduction there. But second, as you said, the product mix and a stronger growth also contribute to the cost reduction. We brought about 28% -- more than 28% in the volume year-over-year as well as our product mix, our e-commerce related products has increased. That typically has a lower wage on -- and also have a higher incomes per kilograms in that. So basically, combination of that.  And on second one for the Express. Yeah. So we continue to drive for efficiency and the cost reduction, but meanwhile we want to balancing the profitability and sustainability of growth, rather than purely just for market share. So going forward, what we are going to do is, first of all, we continue to reduce the cost, improve efficiency as we demonstrated quarter by quarter. Meanwhile, we want to see if we can have more synergies with our other business units, such as Freight. They can share a lot of hot routes and a lot of other on cost. And so synergies will be more applied to, in fact, with that we already have saved a lot of money in the last couple of quarter or last year for that reason. We've shared a lot of synergies with other business units.  So moving forward, we continue to anticipate and expecting a strong revenue -- strong parcel growth, volume growth, as well as improved efficiency as well as the profitabilities.  Baoying Zhai -- Citigroup -- Analyst  Johnny, thanks for your response. Follow-on the average weight of the Freight now, in second quarter, actually?  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Second quarter average weight is close to about 115 to 120. And typically on the -- yeah, 120 -- around the 120. And typically on the fourth quarter will be a little bit lower. Second quarter, we'll be a little bit lower, third quarter will be a little bit higher. Reason, in third quarter typically is a low season and we will probably get some heavier shipment to balancing our load on the truck. So [Indecipherable].  Baoying Zhai -- Citigroup -- Analyst  How is the year-on-year trend on this?  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Last year, in 2019 we've reduced that by about 10 kilograms in average -- 10 kilograms average for the Freight. This year probably it's going to another 10, so we are moving toward about 110 toward the end of the year.  Baoying Zhai -- Citigroup -- Analyst  Okay, understood. And on the second question, may I further clarify with target. So in the next few quarters we target to be in line with the industry growth or we want to surpassing industry growth later date? I know we are very focused on the cost efficiency.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yes. So -- Okay. So I think we have a, I guess, what's going to be industry growth, but we really don't know exactly what's the third quarter and fourth quarter industry growth going to be exactly. But presumably, it's still going to be strong looking at the June number. So yes, so our target for the third and fourth quarter is there anywhere between 25% to 30%, somewhere around -- as we planned it last year. So we don't know exactly say we want to ahead of the market, because we don't really know what's ahead of market is, but I think that 25% to 30% is fairly strong growth. [Multiple Speech]  Let's put this way, we will grow faster than second quarter.  Baoying Zhai -- Citigroup -- Analyst  Okay. Understood. Thank you.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you. The next question we have will come from David Ross of Stifel.  David Ross -- Stifel -- Analyst  Yes. Good morning, Johnny. Good morning, Gloria. On the Express business, I wanted to see what you think the floor might be on pricing. As the package volumes grown, we've been talking about this for the past couple of years, and again, in this quarter, average price per piece was down 21.5% year-over-year. How much lower can it go?  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Okay. Good evening, Ross -- David. I assume you're in US.  David Ross -- Stifel -- Analyst  Yes.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yeah. Okay. So thank you for joining the call. You're quite late there. Yeah, good question. The Express floor, price floor? Okay. So this year as everybody noticed, it's like, much lower price comparatively from last couple of years. Last couple of year may have like price reduction in 10, 20 or low teens, but this year, it's quite large. Partially because of COVID-19, from the recovery of COVID-19, and people wanted to recover the network quickly, so probably lower the price. Second is that, also during the February, basic government gave the toll waivers and toll waiver -- the toll waiver -- basically a toll is about 30% transportation cost, transportation is about 60% of the total -- total cost for the parcel. So we're talking about 18% to 20% on cost saving on the toll waivers. And so that contributed also to the -- lower the cost and some of the pricing -- severe price reduction, which we have seen.  We anticipate pricing continue to go down, but it's not -- it's going to be as steep as this. But essentially all the -- in end of day, all your costs are going to have a limitation, right? Given that how much the fuel cost is going to be, given the how much toll and everything else and that's always going to be there, it is not going to disappear. So, yeah, so I think the cost reduction is still going to do for going there. I mean, we're still looking at the year-over-year cost reduction target. But as it goes, the cost reduction is going to be diminishing return, right? Because essentially, you perhaps hold out. But -- and also I think the flow -- the pricing flow is also going to be fall out. I cannot tell you exactly what it is. Is that going to be $2 or below $2 or where it is, but I can say is that, cost reduction will continue, but however, cost reductions are going to be slowing down. And I can say is that competition is still going to be there. The pricing is still going to be lower. But honestly, I don't know where for us, but I would anticipate that the flow is going to be lower in today, but not as much steeper as what we have experienced the last quarter.  David Ross -- Stifel -- Analyst  That's helpful. And then on the volume side at Express, it was up 19% year-over-year in the quarter, how did it progressed through the quarter? Was April not as good and then May and June are much stronger? And where do we sit here in July? Just kind of frame that 19% for us. Is it actually better than that?  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yeah. So, April we actually grown about 14% or 13%, and June we grown about 26%. So looking at July, right now, we are looking at about -- anywhere from 25% to 30%.  David Ross -- Stifel -- Analyst  Excellent. And then last question, just saw a headline about JD.com buying interest in Kuayue Express. Does that mean anything to the competitive landscape?  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Kuayue Express has no direct business overlap with us, they are more on the high end -- high end air travel, air based parcels or the freight. So, yes, it will have a minimal impact to us.  David Ross -- Stifel -- Analyst  Great, thank you very much.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you, David. Have a good evening.  Operator  And next we have Ronald Keung of Goldman Sachs.  Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  Thank you. Hi, Johnny. Hi, Gloria. Few question from me as well. Firstly, would be just how -- again on the Express pricing strategy. I mean, we've cut prices by 20% and positive growth relatively was slower versus, say, the other Yunda's and ZTO that have cut prices by 30% but kind of hanging in there with similar growth as ZTO in the second quarter. So we could see how -- what we're choosing between kind of profitability and market share gains and much here in the second quarter. Then into the second half and given, I think this is still quite a scale game, because we can't grow materially slower. So I think if you're targeting in line growth with the industry, should we expect kind of the ASP differential between you and the players to be more similar into the second half. So overall, price declines may be smaller for the others as well. But just that we will not be kind of pricing kind of less -- 10% less in pricing decline, maybe is that likely more that will be kind of a bit following the rest in the second half and then achieving kind of industry growth rates into the second half? It's the first question.  And then for the second, could you kind of give us some metrics on your kind of franchisees, health of franchisees any kind of turnover ratio that you could share? And how are we seeing just these new entrants including J&T that's coming in, do we see that could impact any of our kind of franchisees or the competitive landscape into the second half? Thank you.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Okay. So basically, you have two questions. One is about the second quarter pricing strategy and growth strategy. Yeah, so as you rightly pointed out, our peer players, they actually had a steeper pricing reduction than what we have done. Partly because we wanted to really improve the margin and have a profitability there. Moving to the second quarter, we still wanted to maintain our strategy to balance volume growth, as well as the profitability. So I don't think that we are going to meet the price just for the sake of share, because I think it's the more important currently is consolidating our ability to cost reduction and improve the quality in some other areas. Because the volume is always going to be there. If it is not here today, when you do a better job you can always get it back. So I think that our strategy -- to answer your questions, we are not going to a lower the pricing further more.  In fact, if you're look into last couple of years, the third quarter and toward the end of third quarter and fourth quarter the actual price goes up a little bit -- goes up a little bit because the high season, everybody is expecting huge volumes, a much bigger than July. And July is typically a lowest season, July and August. So fourth quarter I think the pricing is going to be not much lower, but I think it may be even improved. So that's to my first question. Your first question.  Second question is to the competitive landscape of new entries and -- new entrants and these. As you all know, right. The market is very competitive. In the past 10 years we are in this business. Every year we have to invest a huge amount of money and efforts in upgrade automations and the sites and everything. And in fact, if you build a site, you are looking for new site, I'll take a long time as well. So it requires time to build the order network and everything else. So I don't really -- I really don't think that new entrants will have a significant impact to our current business.  Back to what you said about the stability of our franchisees. I think, of course, in this kind of competitive market when the pricing are lower, last-mile delivery fee are lower. Some uncertainties or some kind of problems within the franchise networks is anticipated. However, we have done a good job in maintaining communication and actually working with the franchisees to make sure that they can also working with was with the company to weather through this competitive market. In fact, with some of the franchisees, through this -- their cost reduction and efficiency improvement, they actually become stronger in competitiveness. So given that, I would say that the franchisees is really stable. We would see a few of them may have some problems in the May and June time when the delivery -- last-mile delivery cost was lower, but that was quickly stabilized and so far we don't see a major problems with the franchisee network.  In fact, as you said, new entrants comes in and we don't see a -- at least, I don't know where large amount of franchisees has joined the new entrants, because they understood that it would take lots of effort to really get the network, so they rather be working with the company and best to further the development of the -- and the real protected investment in the past.  Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  Thank you. That's very useful. Thank you, Shao.  Operator  Next we have Thomas Chong of Jefferies.  Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst  Hi. Thanks management for taking my question. I have a couple of questions regarding our domestic and international business. I think the first, can management comments about our shopping hubs target in 2020? And also our thoughts on increasing popularity, talking about the one-hour delivery, any thoughts there?  And my second question is about our international business. How should we think about the next few years, KPI that we want to achieve given a lot of geopolitical tensions, as well as COVID? Thank you.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Okay. Thank you, Thomas. I have a little bit difficult to hear well on the first question, but I guess your question is, what's our expectation of the number of hubs during the year. Right?  Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst  Yes.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  If that's the case -- Yes. So we right now maintain about, self-operate about 87 hubs in all. There is some small hubs where we may want to consolidate, but we might want to open one or two [Technical Issues]  Operator  Excuse me, everyone. We will shortly reestablish connection here. Again, please standby, we will try to reestablish connection with the management. Everyone thank you for you still connected, please standby. Thank you again, everyone. Again, please standby for the Best Inc. Conference Call. Again, we are just reestablishing the connection with the management team. Again, thank you, and please standby.  Okay. Yes, sir. We can hear your location now.  Unidentified Speaker  I can't hear you. Anybody can here.  Operator  Okay. Currently the caller can hear you sir.  Unidentified Speaker  I know, but we have a problem, because this is the backup in Hong Kong. We can hear, but the main line in Hangzhou is not working. Our Chairman and our CFO are in Hangzhou, so what happened to that line?  Operator  Thank you for standing by. The Best Incorporated conference call will start momentarily.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Hello, how much of you still there. I'm sorry, it is a technical issue. The line seems went there immediately.  Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst  Hi. This is Thomas. I'm here.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  I'm very sorry. We are talking and everybody tells me is you guys have no voice. We call the operator and there seems what happened. But we redialed and reconnected. So thank you very much for patients. I'm very sorry. So just half I answered. On the international front, I'll give you a little bit color. One is that, international is actually growing very rapidly. So like I just said, in the US, actually the second quarter we see our volume -- both our volume and the bottom line actually improved much more than we expected.  Southeast Asia also growing very rapidly as demonstrated on the second quarter, let's say, our Thailand, was growing about 90% quarter-over-quarter. Vietnam was at over 50% year over -- quarter-over-quarter, but we also see the new entry to the Malaysia, Singapore, they are also growing very rapidly. So that's the second front. Third is that, what do we really see is that a big trends on the cross-border business, so lot of merchants they open shops in Southeast Asia, in Lazada shopping, etc. They actually purchase most of the products in China from -- from Guangzhou, Dongguan, etc. Then we shifted to the Southeast Asia. And so our supply chain grew, supply chain management grew, but they're doing a lot of this works with, for example, with local government in Kunming, in Yunnan, Guangxi, Nanning to open the route through the road transportation, through the land to Vietnam and the Thailand. Previously most of these transportation are done through the sea freight or air freight, but now it's open another front through the land lines. So I would still anticipate our supply chain was also going to be benefited lot over collecting products in China and over ship to land transportation or seas through the Southeast Asia into the ground.  So we will continue to manage our cost structure. Initially we have invested a lot of equipments and capex into Vietnam and Thailand, like we just did in China in the past. And that actually as the volume goes up and the per parcel cost goes down a lot. So we are anticipating two things, continue a fast growth on the topline and improvement on the per parcel cost to overly reducing the losses in the global business and hopefully in the next year, we will see a much balanced results on that.  Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst  Thank you.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Okay.  Operator  Thank you. The next question we have will come from Eric Zong of Macquarie.  Eric Zong -- Macquarie -- Analyst  Hi, Johnny and management team. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick questions. So one is regarding the last mile delivery fee in Express delivery business. So we saw that last mile delivery fee are RMB1.2 per parcel, which was much lower than a year ago, was lower than the first quarter. So just thinking about the longer term, like, I just want to know your view, like what's the draw for last mile delivery fee going forward in the second half of next year? And would you like, maybe we can say last-mile delivery phase going below [Indecipherable] per parcel next year. Okay. That's my first question.  And the second question is regarding your Store+ business being off-plan. So do you have any news toward that development?  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Okay. Yeah. So last mile [Technical Issues] reduced compared quarter-by-quarter as compared with last year are primarily driven by two, right? One, as the volume grows you get a more density for delivery. So definitely your cost is going to be -- per parcel is going to be lower. Imagine the area which has one parcel or two parcel, cost wise this is going to be improved. The second is on -- because of severe competition more and more last mile delivery is through the post, through the stores or some other kind of mean lockers, the parcel lockers and stuff like that.  In the past, last year, I think only 35% -- only 35% of the parcel was delivered through the last mile, other means of last mile, through locker box, through the other stores, etc. But this year, it already increased to 50% or 60%. And in fact the portion is still increasing. But that has a much lower cost structure compared with deliver on the door to door. Because think about a delivery person carry 50 parcels going into a lock box, the cost will be much lower than deliver 50 box, parcel into 50 families door to door. So that's the thing.  So you're quite -- your question was, where is the floor? I think that continue to lower. I cannot say that should be $1 or less. But what I'm saying, the trend is continue to be gradually lower. As I said, the two last reasons or factors. One is, increasing volumes low the cost. And second is, more meetings of last mile delivery versus in person door to door type of delivery. Would that be lower than RMB1? It's possible, but I'm not going guess when it is going to be. It also depends on the franchisees acceptance, stability. We want to maintain a healthy, stable last mile delivery network and make sure that the franchisees are stable and they can be -- do a good services to our customers.  The second question you had was a spin-off some of the business units. As you -- we had said in several call that the company, the management team are continuously looking for various ways to improve the shareholders' value, as well as the business development, liquidity and the further development of business that we think is going to bring future growth opportunity for the company. As we did for Freight, right? We're the first one really in early 2012 started a freight business. And we right now bearing the fruits after six, seven years of development, since last year the freight business is growing rapidly, it is also making profit and profitable.  So hoping that our international business, as well as our store business is going to bring a long -- contribute to our long-term growth and profitability. Meanwhile, it creates a lot of synergies between our -- for example, our Store+ with our supply chains and the Global with our supply chain as well as Express and Freight. So hopefully that's thing. So we are continuing to looking at these opportunities, but we don't have anything to report right now. We're certainly, as you know, when more is solid. So. Eric, thank you.  Eric Zong -- Macquarie -- Analyst  Okay, thank you.  Operator  And next we have Hans Chung of KeyBanc.  Eric Zong -- Macquarie -- Analyst  Hi, good morning, Johnny and Gloria. And George [Phonetic] thank you for taking my question. So I have two question. First, still regarding our -- the balanced strategy on the pricing and growth in Express. So I think that your scale still matter a lot in Express industry. And then -- so my question is, how should we make sure -- because I think that going forward, it should be, whether we can reduce our cost faster than the price decline, right? So I think going forward, how should we make sure we can continue to achieve the faster cost reduction without, let's say, maybe just to keep the in-line industry growth or maybe even slower, and, let's say, in the medium to longer term.  And then second question would be just regarding the Thailand market in Tucson. Can you give us, like, what kind of competitive landscape in that market? Like what's our market share now and then what's the unit economy so far? And what should we think about that in next one to two years? Thank you.  Shao-Ning Johnny Chou -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Okay, thank you, Hans. You have three questions. I'm going to ask you -- first question you had was on the strategy on pricing. Yeah, so our pricing, as we said, we want to make sure that the pricing is in line with our cost reduction strategy, right? So we want to make the margin improvement as well as the profitability. So we are not going to say blindly follow the pricing on the market or the others. As we demonstrated on the second quarter, even though our volumes growth has been impacted somewhat, 19% versus more than market growth or more than 30%. But we are making a very healthy pricing. Our pricing is literally look at June number, second quarter, we're pretty higher with higher ASP than some of our peers. So, yes, pricing side, we're maintaining that strategy, right? Doing a cost reduction then that means that we will improve our margin on that.  So that lead to your second question. So what's the cost reduction strategy, right? So you say the pricing is based on your cost reduction. Well, cost relations from -- mainly from four area, right? Largest is transportation, because transportation -- if you look at our second quarter, we have about less than RMB1 total cost, right? So the transporting cost is about 60% of it. Given our third quarter, maybe even little bit more than 60% of it, because the waiver for the toll, everything is gone. So let's say, transportation side. So we have been doing a good job to continue to lower the transportation cost, primarily driven by three things, right? Volume growth, of course, one of them, that's most obvious. But second is really through a more dynamic routing, we have a R&D team for the industrial engineering and they're working on the system, we already have a system in place, so they can dynamically really do a routing, so make sure that our routing are most efficient.  So that's second. Use of technologies solution automations for the routing efficiencies. And the third is basically synergies across with our other business units. For example, Freight volume is very large already, we are actually doing -- current year we're doing like 28,000 tonnes a day, that translate to equivalent to a similar type of network of same sizable network as the Express. So how do you combining some of these transportation routes, especially to a remote area, a long distance area which timing -- delivery of timing is not critical. And you know what, you have two or three days to work out, how do you combining them, some of the routing efficiencies to reduce the total cost for both Freight as well as for the Express.  So we started a project last year for merging of Freight and Express on the transportation side, we just started. I think we have a lot more to go to make sure that the cost can be reduced, meanwhile, the service level can be maintained. So we are not reducing the the transit time or anything else, and make sure that our really time and transit time can be maintained. So that could be looking forward to on reduced some more cost on that front.  Yeah. So third is on Thailand market. I'm sorry. The Thailand market --Thailand is actually -- I think in the past Thailand actually the offline market is actually well developed through like 30, 40 years development. Off market is well developed, but since a couple of years ago, I think I would say 2018 starting the e-commerce growth very rapidly. Even though they only have a 3% penetration online for the total consumption, but that's growing every year 30%, 40% for the past couple of years. So I think that trend is only going to be accelerating.  Our market position, we entered the market little bit late, because there is several local players and some other international players already there. But however, our market share has been growing very rapidly. We enter Thailand market in, I think, it was in early 2019. So we then basically landed the first group people 2018, into Thailand in late 2018. We started building up the network of 2019 and start building on top of that. As on the June our peak volume already exceeded like 200,000 volumes and still growing very rapidly. So hopefully by end of year, we will be moving much higher volume grow.

India’s latest set of incentives to entice businesses moving away from China seem to be working, with companies from Samsung Electronics Co. to Apple Inc.’s assembly partners showing interest in investing in the South Asian nation.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in March announced incentives that make niche firms — electronics manufacturers — eligible for a payment of 4%-6% of their incremental sales over the next five years. The result: about two dozen companies pledged $1.5 billion of investments to set up mobile-phone factories in the country.  Besides Samsung, those that have shown interest are Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known as Foxconn, Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. India has also extended similar incentives to pharmaceutical businesses, and plans to cover more sectors, which may include automobiles, textiles, and food processing under the program.  While companies have been actively looking to diversify supply chains amid the U.S.-China trade tensions and the coronavirus outbreak, it hasn’t yet translated into big gains for India despite the nation making it cheaper for businesses to open shop. Vietnam remains the most favored destination, followed by Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand, according to a recent survey by Standard Chartered Plc.  [Bloomberg]  “There is a reasonable chance for India to gain in terms of incremental investment of supply chains within the country over the medium term,” said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Mumbai. “These programs are aimed at increasing India’s manufacturing share in the gross domestic product.”  Economic Boost  Samsung plans to make $40 billion worth of smartphones in India and may shift a major part of its production from Vietnam and other countries, the Economic Times reported, citing people it didn’t identify. Samsung didn’t respond to queries from the newspaper.  The incentives would help bring an additional investment of $55 billion over five years, adding 0.5% to India’s economic output, according to analysts led by Neelkanth Mishra at Credit Suisse Group AG. This could shift an additional 10% of global smart-phone production to India in five years, most of it from China, they wrote in a report Aug. 10.  That complements Modi’s goal to grow the share of manufacturing in the economy to 25% from the current around 15% as part of his ‘Make in India’ program. His government has already lowered taxes on companies to among the lowest in Asia, seeking to attract new investments in an economy headed for its first contraction in more than four decades this year.  The latest output-linked incentive plan is a “big win for Make in India,” Amish Shah, an analyst at BofA Securities, said in a report to clients. He sees gains for industrials, cement, pharmaceuticals, metals and logistics, with long-term indirect benefits across many sectors."

The downturn brought on by covid-19 will test the industry.    Aug 15th 2020 edition.    Bangladesh may be the homeland of microcredit, but no country is keener on it than Cambodia. According to its central bank, there were some 160,000 branches of microfinance institutions around the country in 2016—one for almost every square kilometre of Cambodian territory. Almost 2.2m of Cambodia’s 10m-odd adults have a microcredit loan outstanding, according to the Cambodian Microfinance Association (cma), an industry group. The average debt is $3,320—roughly twice the country’s annual gdp per person. Credit is growing by 40% a year.    The microfinance boom has brought many benefits. An obvious one is a decline in the use of loan sharks. Between 2004 and 2017 the share of households borrowing from formal sources jumped from 8% to 30% while the proportion using informal moneylenders dropped from 32% to less than 6%, according to research published last year by the World Bank. The shift saved people money. The interest rates charged by formal lenders are lower and have been falling for more than a decade, even though some microcredit outfits are purely commercial operations.    All this has made it possible for many Cambodians to fund a new business, obtain an education or pay for urgent medical care. The cma links growing access to credit to falling levels of poverty. The share of Cambodians living below the national poverty line (earning less than $0.93 a day) dropped from almost 48% in 2007 to less than 14% in 2014—although the main reason for the improvement was Cambodia’s rapid economic growth over that period. Academic research suggests microfinance may have helped improve farming methods and boost living standards for the poorest Cambodians.    But the industry’s breakneck growth may not be sustainable. Household debt has swollen as the size of loans has ballooned. According to the World Bank, the average loan grew “more than tenfold” over the past five years. Larger debts have led to longer repayment periods. “[Cambodia] probably should have had a crisis by now,” admits Daniel Rozas, an adviser to the cma, “but somehow it hasn’t.”    That may be in part thanks to the efforts of the National Bank of Cambodia, the central bank, to tame the industry. It has raised capital requirements and obliged lenders to maintain hotlines so customers can get in touch directly, if needed, with complaints. It has also introduced rules about how loans should be marketed. The cma has instituted guidelines for its members, too. And Cambodia has a well-functioning credit bureau.    Some regulations, however, may be exacerbating the industry’s excesses. The central bank’s introduction of an interest-rate cap of 18% a year in 2017 seems to have backfired. Because of the cap, the cma says, microfinance institutions can turn a profit only by lending more than $2,000. The number of loans of $500 or less declined by 48% after the rule’s introduction, the World Bank estimates. Some fees rose, too.    The cma says defaults are minimal, with only 1% of loans in serious arrears at the beginning of the year. But there are hints that borrowers are getting into difficulty. The typical loan uses land as collateral, according to a forthcoming paper by W. Nathan Green of the National University of Singapore and Maryann Bylander of Lewis & Clark College in America. Lenders seldom take borrowers to court to repossess land; it is not worth the time and expense for a loan of just a few thousand dollars. But many conscientious borrowers appear to sell their land voluntarily to pay up. Government surveys show that the proportion of people who are landless rose from 32% in 2009 to 51% in 2016. Among the many reasons given for selling land, one of the most common was to repay debts. Given that the government does little to monitor the conduct of lenders, and many land sales are informal, it is hard to tell how voluntary such transactions really are.    Whatever the true state of Cambodians’ finances, they are about to get worse. The garment industry, which until recently employed some 740,000 people, has been particularly badly hit by the covid-19 pandemic, as orders from America and Europe have plunged. Perhaps a third of garment factories have stopped work. Research suggests that each worker in the factories supports three other people, so the effects will ripple across the country. Cambodia’s second-biggest industry, tourism, has been hit even harder.    A farmer in Battambang province gives a sense of the problem. He says that between the downturn brought on by the coronavirus and a recent drought, he is struggling to repay a $600 loan that he took out last year to buy poultry. He relies on a daughter sending part of her wages as a garment-worker to keep making payments—money that is now in doubt.    The government is not blind to the problem. In June Hun Sen, the prime minister, promised to spend about $25m a month to help some 600,000 poor families. The National Bank has encouraged lenders to reschedule or defer payments. The cma says its members have restructured almost 245,000 loans.    But the few remaining critics of the authorities in Cambodia, which Mr Hun Sen has run for 35 years with ever-increasing repressiveness, clearly consider the growth of debt a weak spot for the government. In April activists called for loan payments and interest accrual to be suspended for three months. In May Sam Rainsy, an opposition politician living abroad, said Cambodians struggling to pay debts should not sell their homes or land. Mr Hun Sen’s advice to lenders was blunt: “Confiscate properties of those who follow the opposition’s appeal not to pay back the loans.”  分享： 喜欢 0 赠金笔  加载中，请稍候......"

By the time the pro-democracy protests began in earnest at 4 p.m., the small right-wing royalist contingent had disappeared.  After weeks of rising tensions and days of light monsoon season rains, demonstrators of all ages gathered under clear skies on Sunday. The rally, spearheaded by the Free People student movement that arose with earlier protests in July, follows weeks of increasingly bold demands from student-led groups and ramped-up government intimidation.  The protests began prior to COVID-19 lockdown as a response to the dissolution of the liberal Future Forward Party in February. Around the 2019 Thai elections in March of that year, the government led by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha—which took power in a 2014 military coup and installed a system in which no party can take power without the consent of the military—used a variety of legal tools to harass the opposition, particularly the Future Forward Party and its leader, the charismatic mogul Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.  When COVID-19 began to abate in Thailand, the protests resumed around the country in July with the Free People movement, then known as Free Youth, staging a protest at the Democracy Monument to demand the newly reshuffled cabinet’s resignation, the dissolution of parliament, and the drafting of a new constitution—of which Thailand has had 19 since the 1930s. But the stakes got even higher on Aug. 3, when some protesters began to suggest monarchical reform.  Thailand’s late king was widely popular, but the rule of his son and current monarch King Maha Vajiralongkorn of the 238-year-old Chakri dynasty has drawn controversy. Apart from his raucous youth, divorces, and consolidation of power—all of which have drawn condemnation from protesters—the monarch also spent the coronavirus pandemic in his residences in the Bavarian Alps at a time when Thailand has suffered intense economic problems.  Mentioning the king is a high-stakes gamble in Thailand. Section 112 of the Criminal Code, also known as the lèse-majesté law, forbids criticizing the monarchy, and it has been used more than 90 times since the coup in 2014—with sentences as long as 15 years handed down. But while the lèse-majesté law is the most infamous, in practice the government more commonly uses the Computer Crime Act and charges of sedition against opponents, charging them for public statements and even Facebook posts.  That makes any demonstration a risky endeavor. As the crowd grew by the Democracy Monument, the protests got off to a tense start, with protesters reenacting past killings and shouting at police officers.  Two days before the protest on Sunday, the student leader Parit “Penguin” Chiwarak was filmed being carried by police officers to be charged with sedition under Section 116 of the Criminal Code. Despite bail conditions, Penguin made an appearance at the protest, waving through an apartment window. The lawyer Anon Nampa and student activist Panupong Jaadnok were also arrested prior to the event and face further charges.  “Without freedom, we have nothing. We Thais want real democracy,” said Fai, 23, using only one name for anonymity, in a coffee shop on Dinso Road as the protests begin, thumbing through paper signs written in Thai and English reading “Blood on Your Hands” and “Prayut Get Out.” Behind him, a police officer picked up an iced Americano. “How we get this I do not know, but this is how we start,” Fai added.  After chants, speeches, and stirring commentary from a charismatic transgender presenter, the protests took on a concert atmosphere as the sun set, complete with rock ballads, comedy, and a surprise performance from Rap Against Dictatorship, famed for their popular and combative stance against the military government. Protesters waved their phones with the music in solidarity as night fell.  Even as the Criminal Court announced arrest warrants for 15 leaders during the protest, the attitude remained jubilant and triumphant into the evening, as the protest leaders planned to give themselves up to police as an act of civil disobedience.  The protest offered a rare opportunity to bring up topics usually silenced under a conservative junta. The Women for Freedom and Democracy group set up a base to the far west of the Democracy Monument, where supporters of LGBT rights, sex workers’ rights, and women’s rights converged to write stories in crayon on a tarpaulin.  “If we have true democracy that means we can have true equality too. LGBT people do not have true rights in Thailand,” said a 21-year-old student protester from Chulalongkorn University wearing a rainbow LGBTQ pride flag as a cape. When asked for his name, he waved his hand over the crowd and said, “Today, my name is Victorious.”  Six hundred police officers with the Metropolitan Police Bureau were sent to the site to ensure security and prevent violence among protesters, police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen said, adding that the authorities would be ensuring that protesters follow the law, including restrictions under the COVID-19 emergency decree.  As Thailand nears its sixth month under the pandemic emergency decree—despite not having a single community transmission since May—the continued emergency measures have caused concern.  “With this COVID economy, it is difficult,” said a 21-year-old protester who asked to be referred to as Alex. “We want to decide for ourselves.”  “I was very sad to see this Future Forward Party go away like this” added Alex, who said he attended the February protests. “We want to speak out. But how can we?”  It is not just at home that protesters face danger. Nationalist forces have far-reaching powers under Southeast Asia’s dictator cabal, which, for example, enabled the abduction by armed men of the Thai pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit outside his home in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, while he was living in exile. He is believed by some to be dead, but his sister maintains hope he is alive.  Official opposition to the protests took a familiar form, with government loyalist Sen. Somchai Sawaengkarn, appointed to his position by the junta, proposing authorities investigate the protest’s funding, questioning how the demonstrators could have afforded the giant LED screen on display during the protest. He added that bail should be revoked for those arrested under the sweeping sedition laws.  The specter of the 1976 Thammasat University massacre, an attack on students and leftists in which dozens were killed and some hanged from trees by royalists and paramilitary attackers aided by police, also hangs over events. Thai newspapers and royalist forces began intimating what a shame it would be if something of this nature were to happen again. High-profile Gen. Apirat Kongsompong said of the protesters, “The coronavirus can be cured, but the disease of chung-chart (nation-hating) cannot be cured.”  While stressing they do not wish to end the monarchy, protesters have submitted a 10-point reform plan that includes limits to the palace budget, scrapping the lèse-majesté law, ending political indoctrination in schools, and investigating those who have been disappeared for slights against the monarchy. While some signs and costumes during the Aug. 16 protest did directly address the topic of the monarchy, there have been attempts from right-wing and royalist groups to paint the entire opposition as anti-monarchy.  The Coordination Center of Vocational Students, a pro-monarchy group, vowed prior to the protest to record video and audio in case anyone should say or do anything insulting to the monarchy.  The police, too, were on the lookout for so-called third parties in the protest, according to the Bangkok police department’s Maj. Gen. Somprasong Yenthuam. However, as the day wore on, police sat in the alleyways surrounding Ratchadamnoen Avenue, eating, smoking, and taking pictures of the sunset on their phones.  “It is the biggest protest ever after the coup in 2014. I am really surprised by the number of people joining the protest as well as the diversity,” said the student protester Surachet Suanchabok, who is studying political science at Chulalongkorn University. “Not only the youth anymore but also the working class, the elders, the LGBTQ+, the feminists. … All share the same goal, which is justice. I do not think that our demands are too much to manage to become a reality.”"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in March announced incentives that make niche firms — electronics manufacturers — eligible for a payment of 4%-6% of their incremental sales over the next five years. The result: about two dozen companies pledged $1.5 billion of investments to set up mobile-phone factories in the country.  Besides Samsung, those that have shown interest are Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known as Foxconn, Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. India has also extended similar incentives to pharmaceutical businesses, and plans to cover more sectors, which may include automobiles, textiles, and food processing under the program.  While companies have been actively looking to diversify supply chains amid the U.S.-China trade tensions and the coronavirus outbreak, it hasn’t yet translated into big gains for India despite the nation making it cheaper for businesses to open shop. Vietnam remains the most favored destination, followed by Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand, according to a recent survey by Standard Chartered Plc.  “There is a reasonable chance for India to gain in terms of incremental investment of supply chains within the country over the medium term,” said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Mumbai. “These programs are aimed at increasing India’s manufacturing share in the gross domestic product.”  Also read: Revenge consumption — the new shopping trend that can shake up sleepy markets post-Covid  Economic boost  The government expects the program for electronics alone could lead to $153 billion worth of manufactured goods over the next five years and create about one million jobs directly and indirectly.  This would bring an additional investment of $55 billion over five years, adding 0.5% to India’s economic output, according to analysts led by Neelkanth Mishra at Credit Suisse Group AG. This could shift an additional 10% of global smart-phone production to India in five years, most of it from China, they wrote in a report Aug. 10.  That complements Modi’s goal to grow the share of manufacturing in the economy to 25% from the current around 15% as part of his ‘Make in India’ program. His government has already lowered taxes on companies to among the lowest in Asia, seeking to attract new investments in an economy headed for its first contraction in more than four decades this year.  The latest output-linked incentive plan is a “big win for Make in India,” Amish Shah, an analyst at BofA Securities, said in a report to clients.

It contains language that some readers may find offensive.  It was dark when the plane touched down in Hong Kong from Phnom Penh. Noor Yuni swiftly cleared immigration and collected her luggage. But as she approached the ""nothing to declare"" lane, a customs officer pulled her aside, she says.  The 21-year-old Indonesian's bag was put into the security scanner and she remembers agreeing to be searched.  By the time officers had slashed open the lining of her backpack and dislodged the white crystals concealed inside, Yuni said she knew she'd been tricked.  Yuni is not her real name. CNN is using an alias because the former accused drug trafficker, now aged 23, wants to move on with her life.  Back in 2018, hours before her flight, her new boss had given her a padlocked bag in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. She says the middle-aged Nigerian man, who she knew only as Peter, claimed it was ""just clothes"" and promised to pay her $1,000 if she took it to Hong Kong.  But she never saw Peter again. The crystals turned out to be 2kg of methamphetamine, worth $140,000 when the haul was seized.  At that moment, Yuni became one of tens of thousands of women caught up in Asia's punitive drug wars. She was arrested in Hong Kong on suspicion of drug trafficking, a crime carrying up to life imprisonment in the city, and execution in other parts of the region.  An overlooked consequence of Asia's drug wars is the outsized impact they have had on women.  Today, jails in East and Southeast Asia hold the world's biggest proportions of female prisoners. In many nations, the majority are incarcerated for drug offenses: 82% of women in Thai prisons are jailed for this and in the Philippines that figure is 53%.  Criminologists widely agree this surge is not due to an increase in women's criminal activity, but tougher sentencing for low-level drug crimes.  Women tend to be involved at the bottom rungs of the trade, where most arrests take place.  There is no data showing exactly how many women work as so-called drug mules. But the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights has raised concern about the "" over-incarceration "" of women couriers and growing research is unraveling critical connections between gender, crime and justice.  Yuni was elated when a friend told her about a lucrative ""traveling job."" I wanted ""to learn about the world,"" she says in a WhatsApp video call from the Indonesian city of Medan.  The high school graduate had dreamed of going to university to study economics but drifted into waitressing jobs to support her family. Her mother was ill and her father's ad hoc building work didn't cover their bills.  Yuni says the recruiter, an older Indonesian woman, flew her to a nearby island for an interview. There, she was told that her job would start in Cambodia and that her local boss would be a man named Peter.  ""I wasn't suspicious. Maybe I wasn't brave enough to ask questions""Yuni,  Indonesian arrested for drug trafficking  ""I wasn't suspicious,"" says Yuni. ""Maybe I wasn't brave enough to ask questions.""  She admits it was foolish not to look inside the bag Peter gave her in Phnom Penh to fly to Hong Kong. But she says the absence of her fingerprints inside helped support her claim at trial that she didn't know what she was carrying.  The drugs in her bag likely came from the Golden Triangle , the name given to rugged borderlands traversing Myanmar, Thailand and Laos -- one of the world's busiest trafficking hubs.  In recent years, its opium poppy fields have been giving way to jungle laboratories, as the demand for synthetic drugs outstrips the demand for heroin. Today, Southeast Asia is the epicenter of the global methamphetamine trade, which is worth up to $61 billion a year in Asia Pacific alone.  When not paralyzed by the coronavirus pandemic, Hong Kong is a major air transit hub with good security controls. The city metes out harsh punishments for smuggling drugs, according to a March report by the law firm Linklaters for Penal Reform International.  Prison terms of 14 to 20 years were common for female drug traffickers prosecuted in the city, some of the harshest sentences in 18 jurisdictions studied in the report.  ""There appears to be no recognition of the reasons why women become involved"" in drugs, the report said, with ""lower-level involvement"" rarely considered a mitigating factor.  Yuni had no idea about the austere legal landscape she'd entered. She says missed calls from Peter were stacking up on her cellphone as she told customs officials her story.  When no one arrived for the bag at the hotel where he had told her to go, police took Yuni to Tai Lam Center for Women, a maximum-security jail in Hong Kong's New Territories.  For the past seven years, Father John Wotherspoon has taken extraordinary steps to help convicted drug mules in Hong Kong. From his tiny apartment in Kowloon, the 73-year-old priest tries to connect the dots between the couriers trapped in the city's jails and the syndicates that landed them there.  ""It's still the little fish who are arrested,"" he says in a telephone interview.  Years of working as a prison chaplain brought him into contact with men and women couriers and convinced him more could be done to stop traffickers preying on ""people who are vulnerable, who need money, who can be tricked,"" he says.  Father John Wotherspoon has worked with accused drug traffickers in Hong Kong to try to track down drug lords.  So in 2013, the priest says he started asking detainees to write about their experiences. He published the letters on his blog, hoping their accounts could help identify drug lords.  In some cases, Wotherspoon says he traveled to couriers' homes to gather evidence to prove their innocence. He says he has searched for syndicate leaders from Brazil to Thailand. Evidence he has unearthed has been used in court rooms to free detainees.  On one routine chaplaincy visit in 2018, Wotherspoon met Yuni. After hearing her story, he realized he'd found a new piece in the puzzle of a trafficker who had also recruited another Indonesian May Lazarus, not her real name, in the same Hong Kong jail.  ""When I showed (Yuni) a photo of Peter, she broke down. Half in anger, crying,"" he says.  That year, Wotherspoon flew to Cambodia to find Peter, hoping to secretly record him admitting he had duped the Indonesians. He couldn't locate him, but shared his findings with Hong Kong and Cambodian police, as well as the women's legal teams.  ""I hope the publicity of their cases stopped others being tricked,"" he says.  On the Indonesian island where she grew up, Lazarus explains how her life crossed paths with that of Yuni.  ""All wars on drugs have achieved is prison population growth""Samantha Jeffries,  a senior lecturer in criminology at Australia's Griffith University  In December 2016 she, too, was arrested at Hong Kong International Airport for trafficking drugs, aged 21. Authorities found 2.6kg of meth inside a suitcase she carried from Abidjan, a city in West Africa's Ivory Coast. But her journey also started in Phnom Penh.  The young mother says she was introduced to Peter by the same woman who recruited Yuni, a connection they uncovered in jail after Wotherspoon brought them together.  But Lazarus says she was pursuing romance, not a job, to escape an unhappy marriage. After chatting on messaging apps, she met Peter in Cambodia, where he invited her to Abidjan.  On the day of their flight he pulled out, blaming a work emergency, but asked if she could still go and bring back some luggage.  ""(He was) a sweet talker,"" she says.  ""So I said, Okay, why not. It's a free trip,"" adds Lazarus, explaining that she didn't know the suitcase his friends later gave her contained drugs. She spent two nights at a hotel before Peter arranged for her to fly back to Malaysia, with a stopover in Hong Kong.  At first Lazarus pleaded guilty to trafficking drugs. But she later changed her plea hoping she might return sooner to her toddler. She says the free legal aid in Hong Kong, as well as Wotherspoon's help, empowered her to fight the charge.  After 2.5 years in jail awaiting trial, she was freed last June when a jury found her not guilty. Four months later, Lazarus returned to Hong Kong as a witness for Yuni, who was freed, too.  There are no public records explaining the decisions but John Reading , a former deputy director of public prosecutions, says such verdicts usually mean the jury had doubts about whether the women knew they were carrying drugs.  For too long, gender has been ""a blind spot"" in our understanding of criminal justice, says Delphine Lourtau, executive director of the Cornell Center on the Death Penalty Worldwide.  A 2018 report she co-authored found pervasive gender inequality in prosecutions of women for capital drug offenses including women's poorer access to legal representation and bail. Women accused of low-level drug trafficking sometimes received longer sentences than men up the chain, it said, as they had less information to trade for plea deals.  There are often striking similarities in inmates' stories, says Samantha Jeffries, co-author of a 2019 study exploring women's paths to prison for cross-border drug trafficking in Southeast Asia.  Each of the Thai inmates she interviewed in Cambodia, for example, had carried drugs for someone else, usually a foreign man and frequently a romantic partner.  None were career criminals and most had vulnerabilities, such as low education levels or poverty. The majority reported no knowledge of the drugs in their luggage and several were exploited through dating scams, although some expressed their choice to traffic drugs for money.  But when it came to sentencing there was little room to consider their individual circumstances, says Jeffries, a senior lecturer in criminology at Australia's Griffith University, adding that judicial officers should be granted more discretion to account for factors such as culpability or exploitation.  ""All wars on drugs have achieved is prison population growth,"" Jeffries says.  Now divorced, living with her parents and daughter, Lazarus knows her journey could have ended very differently. She was initially booked to fly to Tawau in east Malaysia. But at the last minute, Peter told her to stop over in Hong Kong. Had she flown directly to Malaysia, she says, ""I'd be finished.""  Malaysia has one of the largest death rows in Southeast Asia. As of February 2019, at least 1,281 people there faced execution, according to Amnesty International, nearly triple the number in Thailand, for example.  Capital punishment has mostly been applied against drug trafficking, which carried a mandatory death sentence from 1983 as Malaysia adopted the US rhetoric of drugs as the country's biggest enemy. Though it dropped the mandatory element in 2017, judges routinely sentence people to death for the offense, as lawyers say the conditions to waive the penalty are almost impossible to meet.  The impact of this on foreign women has been staggering. Of the 141 women on death row in Malaysia, as of February 2019, 95% were sentenced for trafficking drugs, compared to 70% of men, found Amnesty. And 90% of the women sentenced to death for drug trafficking were foreigners.  From the start, the system is stacked against non-Malaysians. They're only guaranteed legal representation at trial, with a lack of interpreters and lawyers at arrest, according to the Amnesty report . The presumption of guilt and mistreatment during police interrogation were among other concerns raised by Amnesty.  ""Your access to justice is pretty much dependent on how deep your pockets are,"" says N Sivananthan, a criminal lawyer who's represented hundreds of drug trafficking-accused in Malaysia. He calls some ""active participants"" who swallowed cocaine in plastic bags or strapped meth to their thighs, qualifying they could have been coerced. But many were ""duped,"" he says.  One case still haunts him. Maryam Mansour, a single mother from Tehran, was arrested in Kuala Lumpur in 2010 with an Iranian man, who she described as her boyfriend. Police tailed her from the airport, finding 2.2kg of meth in her bag, but on interrogation, all questions put to her were answered by him.  Court documents say she asked for an interpreter, but the boyfriend, who spoke English, told her not to worry. He was released on a bond and later deemed untraceable; Mansour was sentenced to death.  ""She should have been acquitted at High Court ... Much more could have been done to implicate the man""N Sivananthan,  a criminal lawyer  Sivananthan was her appeal lawyer. ""She should have been acquitted at High Court ... Much more could have been done to implicate the man,"" he says.    Some activists have raised concerns about gender bias in capital appeals. A 2018 study for the Mansour testified the bag was for him and that she didn't know it contained drugs, Sivananthan said. A major challenge, explains the lawyer, is the quality of court-assigned counsel at trial, exposed during appeal when it's nearly impossible to introduce new arguments.Some activists have raised concerns about gender bias in capital appeals. A 2018 study for the Penang Institute , a think tank, based on a small sample of capital punishment cases, suggested women convicted of drug trafficking had a lower chance than men of having their cases overturned.  Mansour's final appeal was also rejected and she remains on death row.  Back in Medan, Yuni has found a job at a poultry factory. She often thinks about the women still jailed in Hong Kong, hoping there will be no more like her.  Jeremy Douglas, a regional representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), says many countries ""continue to sentence couriers and people with low threshold amounts as traffickers -- which they are not."" The UNODC is pushing for sentencing reform to focus on ""traffickers that run the drug trade"" not the couriers ""disposable to organized crime,"" he said.  Yuni, meanwhile, is trying to build a new life.  ""Many people don't believe I didn't know (about the drugs),"" she says. ""But god and the court gave me a chance. My mother supported me. Next time no one can cheat me."""

This is not a sudden crisis, but a structural one. For years, global fashion brands that outsource production to suppliers in developing countries have been making supernormal profits through unfair purchasing practices, while garment workers who produce clothes in unsafe conditions have been left with little to no savings.  A significant majority of the supplier firms in the Asian garment industry are MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) that operate on limited working capital. Within MSMEs, micro enterprises that operate on wafer-thin margins constitute the largest segment and employ the largest number of workers, most of them being women from marginalised communities. These enterprises further rely on piece-rate informal workers in factories or subcontract operations to home-based units that rely on unpaid domestic labour. However, the lack of transparency in supply chains ‘invisibilises’ such units, making it difficult to track super-exploitative practices and hold brands responsible.  Four major shocks  Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, supplier firms faced four major shocks. The first shock came around February 2020 in the form of a shortage of raw materials from China, which affected production in countries like Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Sri Lanka that depend on imported raw materials. In Myanmar, for example, this led to the closure of at least 20 factories and the loss of 10,000 jobs.  The second shock came in the form of cancelled orders, delays in payments or through demand for discounts by brands to suppliers. A survey by the Business and Human Rights Resource Center finds that nearly half of 35 global brands surveyed have not made any public commitment to pay for completed orders. In Bangladesh alone, according to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), this has caused a revenue loss of around $3 billion and has affected some 2.17 million workers.  The third shock that occurred simultaneously or in quick succession with the second came in the form of state-administered lockdowns, which was particularly harsh in countries like India. Indian supplier associations like AEPC and CMAI report that small manufacturers faced unprecedented distress during the first phase of the lockdown due to suspension of supply chains.  The fourth shock to supplier firms in the form of reduced business and dull prospects of recovery arose as a result of the cascading effects of several distinct macroeconomic trends that affected global demand and supply, trade and finance. This is despite the temporary opportunity in the form of producing face-masks that brands and few suppliers have taken advantage of. McKinsey estimates that the global fashion industry will contract by 20-30 per cent in 2020, resulting in a “Darwinian shakeout” affecting 80 per cent of players, if regular sales are disrupted for two months.  The burden of these shocks has been disproportionately borne by workers in Asia, with reports of mass layoffs without severance pay, unpaid wages and wage cuts becoming commonplace.  Demand for concessions  Given the nature of the crisis, garment manufacturing associations in South and South-East Asia have been demanding concessions in utility payments and relaxation in credit so as to sustain themselves. This has been met to some extent by governments through various relief packages, though the quantum of relief has been inadequate. Additionally, industry bodies have also called for a relaxation in labour laws during the crisis, which is in line with the state policy of ‘simplifying’ labour regulations to facilitate the ease of doing business.  Simultaneously, across garment producing countries, there have been reports of union-busting through targeted layoffs and repression by police force. The Business and Human Rights Resource Center (BHRRC) reports that more than 4,870 unionised garment workers have been targeted for dismissal by nine factories in Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and India.  Apart from hampering the freedom of association that is a right of all workers, there is no compelling evidence that such reforms alone generate long-term investment or employment. Industry bodies and governments need to abandon the neo-liberal dogma that unions breed inefficiency. Strong unions through collective bargaining, can in fact, reduce wage inequalities, increase labour productivity and bring stability to workplace relations.  Any progressive change in the industry can only come only with the recognition that international brands are the principal players in export-oriented garment production. The Freight on Board (FOB) price at the point of exchange is set by brands at levels that do not meet the living costs of garment workers, leading to a race to the bottom in terms of wages, while brands corner as much as 75 per cent in profits. Through the fast fashion model, brands have placed undue pressure on suppliers to deliver cheap clothes in low lead times, which in turn has led to new forms of informality and precarity among workers.  Moving forward, fashion needs to ‘slow down’, fair transfer prices must be paid, poverty wages should no longer be accepted as a norm and social protection should be expanded to both formal and informal workers. The case for public investment, labour unions, and the payment of a living wage is stronger than ever.  Firdausi is a research student at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai.

 Through personal tragedy and now a pandemic, the International District treasure has been rem… [+9587 chars]","Today, Phnom Penh Noodle House is a Seattle institution of 30 years, and one that has survived more than its fair share of challenges. It has reopened — in a limited capacity, due to the COVID-19 pandemic — after a nearly two-year hiatus, on South Jackson Street.  But the story really starts with a noodle cart.  Phnom Penh Noodle House traces its origin back three generations, to an early 1940s mobile food operation on the streets of Battambang, Cambodia.  Chan Kao was 14 years old in 1937 when he fled China to avoid conscription in the army amid the Sino-Japanese War. He settled in Cambodia, where he first worked as a farm laborer. After a few years, he started his noodle cart business, which he eventually ran with his wife, Meng Vouch. That two-person operation gradually grew into a full-scale restaurant with lines that stretched out the door for noodle soup, congee, and desserts.  Their son, Sam Ung, grew up mesmerized by the cooks in his parents’ restaurant in Battambang, watching in awe as they kept food moving from wok to plate. He worked his way up, starting with chopping vegetables and meat at age 14. He was a salaried employee by 15, and backup for the lead cook at 16.  Sam likely saw his future in that restaurant. Perhaps he would raise his own children in the kitchen, where they’d learn the business from the ground up, just as he had. But the trajectory of his life changed completely in 1975 — much like his father’s had before him.  A civil war in Cambodia brought the rise of the violent Khmer Rouge regime, which exacted widespread imprisonment, torture, and genocide. Over its four-year rule in the ’70s, the Khmer Rouge was responsible for one of the 20th century’s worst mass killings.  By 1980, Sam and his then-wife Kim — who was pregnant with their first daughter, Dawn — made their way from a refugee camp on the Thai-Cambodian border to settle in Seattle. With few resources, Sam scratched out a living with two jobs, at Ivar’s Acres of Clams and the Rainier Club.  When a small restaurant space became available, Sam opened the first iteration of Phnom Penh Noodle House in 1987, in the Chinatown-International District. He continued cooking at the Rainier Club to keep the family and the fledgling business, afloat.  “They immigrated as refugees, and they had nothing with them and were learning a new culture and language and were trying to acclimate,” Sam’s daughter Diane Le says.  “When they opened the restaurant, they had no understanding of how businesses here are run. And Dad did it. He wore every single hat and just made it happen.”  Back then, the restaurant had 30 to 40 seats and seven items on the menu. A decade in, the roof of the building collapsed under heavy snow, and Phnom Penh Noodle House relocated to a much larger space with room for 120 diners on South King Street. The menu grew alongside a robust catering business.  Sam and Kim eventually had three daughters, Dawn, Diane, and Darlene, who all grew up in their parents’ restaurant. Diane, now the restaurant’s unofficial spokesperson, remembers taking the bus down Jackson Street after she finished classes at Garfield High School. She and her sisters would do their homework, then fill in as servers and have dinner. “We grew up on noodles,” Diane says.  The girls saw Phnom Penh Noodle House grow into a community staple. “People who finished kung fu class upstairs, they’d congregate afterwards in the restaurant,” Diane says. “The various Cambodian associations would have meetings there.”  The restaurant hosted birthdays, graduation parties, and first dates that became wedding anniversary celebrations. Phnom Penh was a second home for multiple generations of patrons. Sam became a respected community member, not just for his food but for his charity work, volunteering and donating food through the Asian Counseling and Referral Service.  And though Sam always told his daughters they were free to pursue other careers — and to a large extent, early on in adulthood, they did — the restaurant called them back. When Sam retired in 2013 as owner and head chef, Dawn and Darlene took over the day-to-day operations, with occasional help from Diane. Darlene’s husband, Peng Liu, became chef.  Dawn, Darlene, and Peng kept the restaurant firing on all burners for five years. But everything changed on September 26, 2017, when Dawn’s son, Devin Cropp, then a high school senior, was hit by a car while walking home from an ultimate frisbee game. The collision caused extensive injuries that required multiple major surgeries — the kind of accident that changes an entire family’s trajectory forever.  There were many challenges that came from running a large, busy restaurant and a flourishing catering business, and the ownership team had already been considering downsizing when the accident happened.  Dawn stepped away from the restaurant to concentrate on caring for Devin, who spent more than a year in hospital. Medical expenses piled up, and even once he was released, Devin needed around-the-clock care.  The sisters decided to shut down Phnom Penh after service on May 28, 2018. Distraught customers poured into the restaurant to buy a meal and express their sympathies. The outpouring showed up everywhere — in comments on the restaurant’s Facebook page and on news stories about the closure.  When a family friend launched a GoFundMe campaign to help with Devin’s mounting medical expenses — including a $14,000 wheelchair lift on a new van — fans of the restaurant were among the contributors.  “Your restaurant was a big part of my childhood that carried into adulthood. Thank you sharing your restaurant with me, my friends and family. It’s my turn to give back and say thank you to you and your family,” wrote donor Tran Dao. To date, the fundraiser, which is still active, has raised more than $91,000 toward a $150,000 goal.  “People came out of nowhere, helping in any way they could, even if it was just a couple hundred dollars. Every little bit really does count,” Diane says. The possibility of reopening was always in the back of their minds. “We had something really special, and that’s just something you don’t want to lose.”  Gradually, the sisters started getting serious about reopening. With Seattle rents at a premium, they scouted locations in Renton and Kent. Then, a former customer told them about a new building in the International District she was brokering. The developer was offering tenant improvement funds that would ease some of the financial burden of opening a new restaurant.  Once again, the community rallied around them, and the list of people who pitched in — from donations through an Indiegogo campaign to space for pop-ups and pro bono legal assistance — was long. It seemed each complex layer involved in building out the new restaurant found support. “It takes an entire village to make this happen,” Diane says.  More help came in the form of a $140,000 grant from the city of Seattle’s Office of Economic Development, and assistance from the Seattle Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority. Although the family once again found themselves starting over, this time they wouldn’t be starting from zero.  As Devin’s situation stabilized, Dawn redirected some energy back toward the restaurant. But Devin, who suffered a traumatic brain injury, will likely need significant care for the rest of his life. On the consciousness scale, Diane says, “We would be ranked at a 9, because we’re conscious, fully aware, we can comprehend and we have cognitive awareness. Whereas Devin is like a 1.5. He’s got movement and sometimes maybe eye contact but he’s still nonverbal, and maybe not fully conscious of where he is or who we are.”  The restaurant was originally set to reopen fully in March, but the chaos of the pandemic and the economic shutdown extinguished those plans. It was just one more challenge facing a family that seems to have resiliency written into its DNA.  Sticking to the original plan, Phnom Penh began serving takeout again in April and then offering some indoor dining under Washington State’s phased “Safe Start” reopening plan, when Seattle got the green light to allow seating at 50 percent capacity.  Newly reborn, Phnom Penh Noodle House sports a redesigned logo and a slick space that’s more modern and representative of the generation currently at the helm. The menu is pared down, but fan favorites, including the honey-black pepper chicken wings, prawn and fish cake noodle soup, mee katang (wide rice noodles in gravy), and beef lok lac (wok-tossed marinated steak cubes), are still there.  It’s a welcome development for scores of diners who consider this restaurant more than just a place to get a good bowl of soup — it’s the return of an essential gathering place, an indispensable thread in a vibrant community web.  But even if you just come for the food, Sam Ung doesn’t think you’ll leave disappointed.  “I traveled around Cambodia trying noodles. I haven’t found any that has beaten mine yet, from the fancy restaurants to the street vendors. I’ve tried them all,” Sam says. “I still think, ‘Mine are better. Mine are better.’”"

During a prospective observational study of sepsis in Takeo Province Cambodia, we enrolled 200 patients over an 18-month period. By coupling traditional diagnostic methods such as culture, serology, and PCR to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and advanced statistical analyses, we successfully identified a pathogenic cause in 46.5% of our cohort. In all, we detected 25 infectious agents in 93 patients, including severe threat pathogens such as Burkholderia pseudomallei and viral pathogens such as Dengue virus. Approximately half of our cohort remained undiagnosed; however, an independent panel of clinical adjudicators determined that 81% of those patients had infectious causes of their hospitalization, further underscoring the difficulty of diagnosing severe infections in resource-limited settings. We garnered greater insight as to the clinical features of severe infection in Cambodia through analysis of a robust set of clinical data.  We enrolled 200 severely ill patients in an observational study of sepsis in Takeo Province Cambodia. In an effort to provide an in-depth characterization of their illness, we combined standard clinical microbiology practices (culture, microscopy, etc) with serological analyses, newer molecular diagnostics, and next-generation sequencing to produce the most detailed characterization to date of sepsis and microbiological cause for southern Cambodia. Specifically, we were able to identify a causative pathogen in 46.5% of cases. A viral source was identified in 26 (13%) patients and bacterial source in 79 (39.5%) patients. In all, we detected 139 infections in 93 (46.5%) patients. Despite our best efforts though, 52.5% of the cohort remained undiagnosed, further underscoring the urgent need for new infectious disease diagnostics that can identify the cause of infections in near real time.  The Austere environments Consortium for Enhanced Sepsis Outcomes (ACESO) is an international collaboration of researchers, led by the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), which executes a coordinated program of research aimed at improving early recognition, diagnosis, and effective treatment of severe infection from all causes in austere settings [ 12 , 13 ]. In May of 2014, ACESO began an observational trial of sepsis at Takeo Provincial Hospital in Cambodia with the goal of identifying the common pathogens causing severe infections in Takeo Province Cambodia. Here, we describe a combination of standard clinical practices, laboratory diagnostics, and NGS utilized to identify the infectious causes of disease in a 200-patient cohort.  Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) potentially offers a comprehensive method for unbiased profiling of sepsis pathogens. While the use of sequencing for clinical diagnosis has long been suggested, recent advancements (i.e., increase in throughput, decrease in cost, etc.) have resulted in the integration of NGS into clinical and surveillance programs becoming increasingly more common [ 6 – 8 ]. Examples of direct sequencing of pathogens from clinical samples have been steadily increasing as the technology improves [ 9 – 11 ]. Bioinformatics expertise is paramount to sequence analysis, as NGS machines generate massive datasets that must be analyzed using specialized software on high performance computing (HPC) clusters. While cost and complexity will make NGS approaches untenable for resource-limited settings in the foreseeable future, application of this technique in select research settings can greatly enhance our understanding of sepsis in the developing world and can direct efforts to develop affordable diagnostic solutions.  Culture-based identification remains the diagnostic gold standard for most bacterial pathogens, however the resources required to develop and maintain a high-quality clinical microbiology laboratory are formidable barriers in less-developed regions of the world. Organizations like the Diagnostic Microbiology Development Program (DMDP) ( http://dmdp.org/ ) have been working to develop the capacity of diagnostic microbiology in Cambodia, but developing microbiology capacity from the ground up presents unique challenges [ 5 ]. By augmenting diagnostic microbiology, additional tools such as microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), molecular (RT PCR) tests, and serological assays can increase the diagnostic abilities of hospitals in resource-limited settings.  As a common pathway leading to severe disease and death from infection, sepsis is a leading cause of illness and mortality world-wide [ 1 ]. Although documented incidence rates of sepsis are rising, it is still likely underreported, especially in low-resource settings, due to diagnostic uncertainty [ 2 ]. Complicating matters, an international consensus panel recently updated its definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3), confining the label to patients with objective evidence of organ system dysfunction [ 2 ]. While this new definition may increase specificity and correctly identify patients with a higher risk of mortality relative to employment of the previous definition (Sepsis-1), it may lead to delayed recognition of patients who still ultimately exhibit poor outcome[ 3 ]. Improved diagnosis is imperative in sepsis to optimize treatment and prevent inappropriate interventions. Despite concerted effort however, we lack effective predictive biomarkers able to differentiate patients presenting with infectious versus non-infectious inflammatory syndromes. Thus, the diagnosis remains predominantly clinical and imprecise, contributing to antibiotic misuse and delays in appropriate antimicrobial treatment [ 4 ].  EDGE Bioinformatics Software was used to classify the composition of microbial sequences derived from patients’ blood samples [ 32 ]. Briefly, raw sequence data (FASTQ files) were submitted to be processed using the EDGE pipeline as follows. Sequencing reads were filtered using high quality and trimming parameters, average quality score of 30. Human reads were subtracted from each sample using Bowtie2 (version 2.3.3); if a read aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) with ≥ 70% similarity via end-to-end alignment with Bowtie2, it was considered host contamination and was removed. Filtered, high-quality non-human reads were analyzed using the following read-based taxonomy classification tools embedded in EDGE software: Kraken Mini [ 33 ], BWA-mem mapping to a bacterial and viral subset of NCBI’s RefSeq [ 34 ], and GOTTCHA [ 35 ]. All EDGE parameters for taxonomy tools were set to default as described previously [ 36 ]. Patients were considered “positive” for microbe presence if all three taxonomy tools agreed. Coverage figures for reads aligning to the O. tsutsugamushi reference (NC_101793) were generated using CLCbio version 11 toolbox (NGS Core Tool, Map Reads to Reference) using default parameters. Heat maps were generated using R statistical programming.  Total RNA was isolated from 2.5 ml of peripheral blood drawn directly into PAXgene RNA stabilization tubes (PreAnalytiX) using the PAXgene Blood miRNA Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples were evaluated using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). RNA library preparations and sequencing reactions were conducted at GENEWIZ, LLC. (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Human rRNA and globin mRNA depletion was performed using Globin-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). RNA sequencing library preparation was performed using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina by following the manufacturer’s recommendations (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Briefly, enriched RNAs were fragmented for 15 minutes at 94°C. First strand and second strand cDNA were subsequently synthesized. cDNA fragments were end repaired and adenylated at 3’ends, and universal adapter was ligated to cDNA fragments, followed by index addition and library enrichment with limited cycle PCR. Sequencing libraries were validated using the Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and quantified by using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as well as by quantitative PCR (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The resulting libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 to produce approximately 50 million reads in a 2×150 nucleotide paired end format. Sequences (post removal of incidental human-derived reads) are deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SR) under project PRJNA408161.  Through a combination of commercially available and laboratory-developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, serological analyses were performed to detect a variety of disease agents that are common to Cambodia. Serological evidence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV) infection was detected using human anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG ELISA (Abcam, USA), and DENV IgM and IgG Capture ELISA (Panbio, USA), respectively, which were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serological evidence of infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi was detected using an ELISA utilizing three recombinant proteins from four strains of O. tsutsugamushi (Karp, Kato, Gilliam and TA763) [ 25 ]. Spotted fever group rickettsia antibodies were detected by ELISA utilizing purified whole cell antigens from three species (R. conorii, R. siberica and R. japonica) [ 25 ], evidence of murine typhus was detected via antibodies to purified whole cell antigens from R. typhi using ELISA [ 26 ], Leptospirosis was also detected by ELISA using four recombinant proteins (LipL32, LipL41, LigA and LigB) from the pathogenic strain of Leptospira interrogans [ 27 , 28 ], and ELISAs for evidence of Coxiella burnetii infection (causative agent of Q fever) employed a recombinant protein from a pathogenic strain (Henzerling) [ 29 ]. In all cases of laboratory-developed assays, cutoff values were derived from negative controls originating from neighboring Thailand that were previously confirmed to be antibody-negative as previously described [ 25 , 29 – 31 ]. A four-fold increase in antibody titer (IgM, IgG) from sera collected at enrollment (acute) and 28 days later (convalescent) was considered positive. Confirmatory analyses of positive results were conducted by IFA as previously described (O. tsutsugamushi) [ 25 ] or according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R. typhi, Spotted Fever Group, Leptospirosis, and Coxiella burnetii, Fuller Laboratories, Fullerton, CA).  Serum RNA samples were tested using primers and probes targeting Dobrava, Hantaan, Puumala, and Seoul viruses ( Table 1 ), using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Additionally, RNA samples were tested using primers and probes targeting the N-terminal end of the NS5 gene of 51 flavivirus species and the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For each assay, a DNA-free PCR mix was used as a negative control for PCR, and positive controls were used as described in Table 1 .  Pathogens targeted for molecular detection are listed in the first column. The specific gene targets are listed in the next column followed by the source of the positive control utilized in the reaction. Finally, the references from which the assays were derived are listed in the last column.  Serum DNA was tested using PCR with genus-specific primers and probes targeting specific sequences of Haemophilus influenzae, Leptospira sp., Neisseria meningitidis, Salmonella typhi, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis ( Table 1 ). Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out according to the referenced protocols using a T100 Thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for Salmonella typhi and Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System for the others, and the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). For each assay, a DNA-free PCR mix was used as a negative control for PCR, and positive controls were as described in Table 1 .  DNA was extracted from 200 μL of serum from each patient collected at time zero (00h). DNA was extracted using the DNA mini extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA was then eluted in 200 μL of Tris EDTA (TE) buffer. DNA was either immediately used or stored at -20°C until molecular analysis. RNA was extracted from 140 μL of serum collected at time zero using the QIAamp viral RNA mini extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was then eluted in 60 μL of TE buffer. RNA was either immediately used or stored at -20°C until molecular analysis.  Aseptic sample collection was performed by the nurse at respective wards of the hospital for patients enrolled in the study. Ten milliliters of blood was aseptically collected from a single site into culture bottles provided by DMDP and incubated at 35°C for seven days. At the discretion of the treating physician, a second culture bottle was drawn for some patients. Turbid culture bottles were Gram-stained and streaked onto appropriate selective and differential media (Ashdown’s, Chocolate, MacConkey) and standard biochemical characterizations were performed using the appropriate API strip (bioMérieux). Clinical isolates were transported to the Naval Medical Research Unit-2 in Phnom Penh for confirmatory testing and storage. There, antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was performed using a combination of the disk diffusion method and Etest (bioMérieux). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using guidelines from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [ 16 ]. Suspected Burkholderia pseudomallei isolates were identified and characterized as previously described [ 14 ] and subsequently destroyed in accordance with US DoD regulations. Additionally, the capsular polysaccharide of B. pseudomallei was detected in patient serum using the recently described B. pseudomallei iSTAT assay [ 17 ]. Antimicrobial Sensitivity Testing (AST) was performed on isolates as previously described [ 14 ]. Smears were prepared using quality sputum samples (i.e., <10 epithelial cells per low powered field) for Acid Fast Staining (Ziehl-Neelsen) and Plasmodium sp. microscopy (Giemsa stain). Regardless of quality, sputum was plated on Ashdown’s medium and quality sputum samples were plated on chocolate agar, MacConkey agar and sheep’s blood agar (SBA). Agar plates were incubated at 35°C.  Two independent physicians, board certified in internal medicine and/or infectious disease, reviewed all available hospital information to determine clinical syndrome, presence of infection, source of infection, pathogen, and degree of confidence in pathogen. When determinations from these two reviewers did not concur, a third independent reviewer, board certified in infectious diseases, reviewed the record as a tie-breaker. The committee used five categories to sort patients: “infectious”, “non-infectious”, “unknown”, “unknown–likely infectious”, and “unknown–likely non-infectious”. For pathogens identified by laboratory testing, clinical adjudicators provided judgment on clinical significance, and any identified organisms that were considered contaminants, colonizers, or unlikely causes of the present clinical syndrome were discounted. In a number of cases, more than one organism was identified in a patient where coincident infection could not be ruled out. In these cases, multiple pathogens were reported.  Hospital clinicians ordered additional microbiological testing for patient care when deemed appropriate. For example, additional blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sputum (Giemsa stain, acid-fast stain), urine, and/or wound swab could be collected and tested per hospital protocol and results were recorded as part of the study case report form. Rapid diagnostic tests were also performed at the discretion of the attending physician and recorded in a similar manner for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and malaria (ONE STEP HBsAg, ONE STEP Anti-HCV, ONE STEP Malaria HRP-II (P.f.) and pLDH (P.v.), respectively, Standard Diagnostics, Republic of Korea).  All clinical interventions were provided by and left to the discretion of the attending physicians and hospital medical teams, independent of study procedures. Following informed consent, study team members conducted a history and physical exam and used a standardized case-report form to record demographics, medical history, physical exam findings, and admitting diagnosis. If the patient was unable to provide demographic or symptom information, the data were collected from their LAR. At the time of enrollment, an HIV test (HIV ½ STAT-PAK, CHEMBIO diagnostic) was conducted and blood was aseptically collected from a single site for aerobic blood culture. Additional blood samples were also collected for analysis of peripheral venous blood gases with lactate (epoc, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc. , Tarrytown, NY), complete blood counts (QBC Autoread Plus Dry Hematology System, Drucker Diagnostics, Port Matilda, PA) and clinical chemistries (Piccolo Xpress Chemistry Analyzer Abbott, Princeton, NJ). Finally, blood was drawn into tubes containing clot activators, anticoagulants (K 2 EDTA, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and RNA stabilization matrix (PAXgene, PreAnalytix, Switzerland) for serology, targeted PCR, and RNA sequencing, respectively. Patients were followed throughout their treatment and a record review was conducted at discharge. Patients were requested to return for a follow up at 28 days where clinical samples, longitudinal symptoms and physical exam results were collected. When patients could not return in person, study team members attempted to conduct an interview with patients or LAR by telephone. Mortality in survivors discharged from the hospital was also evaluated at this time.  In May of 2014, ACESO began a prospective observational study of sepsis at TPH [ 14 ] and over the next 18 months enrolled 200 patients. Our study was implemented prior to the publication of Sepsis-3 guidelines [ 2 ] and thus patients were enrolled according to an earlier definition of sepsis [ 15 ]. Adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to TPH within the last 48 hours and who had a suspected infection (as judged by the attending physician) and met at least two of three clinical criteria (thermodysregulation defined as Temperature >38°C or <36°C, tachypnea defined as Respiratory rate >20/min and tachycardia defined as heart rate > 90 bpm) were considered for inclusion [ 15 ]. Exclusion criteria included the following: patients who presented with known active malignancy, known history of nephrotic syndrome or hepatic failure, known immunosuppressive conditions (not including HIV) or medications, including high-dose steroid usage (≥20mg/day), chemotherapy, or radiation treatment within the past 3 months. Patients with a history of organ transplant, hemodynamically significant gastrointestinal bleeding, anatomic or functional asplenia, and general anesthesia or surgery in the past week were also excluded, as were patients who were pregnant or up to 6 weeks post-partum, had a hemoglobin under 7 g/dL, or weighed less than 45kg (later amended to 35kg due to the small stature of the population). Finally, hospital physicians had the ability to defer enrollment for patients they deemed too ill to participate or with an immediately terminal comorbidity. All participants or their legally authorized representatives (LAR) provided written informed consent.  Our study was designed as a prospective observational study of sepsis in Cambodia and was approved by the Naval Medical Research Center Institutional Review Board (NMRC.2013.0019), as well as the Cambodian National Ethics Committee for Health Research (NECHR). The study was conducted in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects. Treatment decisions were exclusively at the discretion of the hospital’s attending physicians. All patients, or their legally authorized representatives, provided written informed consent. Study subjects were assigned a volunteer identification number (VIN) upon enrollment, and were identified by VIN on case report forms and in the electronic database. All analyses were conducted on de-identified data.  Takeo is a predominantly rural province in southwest Cambodia with a majority of the workforce engaged in agriculture. Takeo Provincial Hospital (TPH) is a 250-bed public referral hospital for Takeo and surrounding provinces located in Krong Doun Kaev, Takeo Province, Cambodia [ 14 ]. The hospital admits over 1,000 patients per month for emergency, medical, obstetric, pediatric, and surgical care. While TPH offers a full range of hospital services, severely ill patients who require subspecialty or critical care are routinely transferred to hospitals in Phnom Penh. TPH possesses basic radiology and clinical laboratory services. In 2011, DMDP renovated the microbiology laboratory and continues to enhance microbiology capabilities within the TPH laboratory by providing training and supplies, such as blood culture bottles and selective and differential media for the isolation and identification of infectious bacteria [ 5 ].  Clinical laboratory values were compared for patients with different infectious etiologies as described above. All tests of statistical significance were two-tailed, and significance was defined as p<0.05. Values are medians (IQR). Bolded value with asterisk indicates the value is significantly different from patients without the indicated pathogen. Note: WBC, White Blood Count; Hgb, Hemoglobin; Hct, Hematocrit; Na, Sodium; K, Potassium; Ca, Total Calcium; Cl, Chloride; BUN, Blood Urea Nitrogen; Cr, Creatinine; Glu, Glucose; Tbil, Bilirubin; Tp, Total Protein; ALB, Albumin; AST, Aspartate aminotransferase; ALT, Alanine Aminotransferase.  Complaints of symptoms prior to hospitalization collected during enrollment. Bolded value with asterisk indicates the value is significantly different from patients without the indicated pathogen. Clinical symptoms were compared for patients with different infectious etiologies as described above. All tests of statistical significance were two-tailed, and significance was defined as p<0.05.  We determined there were several statistically significant associations between pathogen and clinical symptoms or laboratory values at enrollment (Tables 4 and 5 ). Patients with evidence of O. tsutsugamushi infection were more likely to present with retro-orbital pain, blurred vision, sore throat, myalgia, abdominal pain, and rash and were more likely to have elevated AST and BUN, and lower total calcium, albumin, and total protein on laboratory analysis. Interestingly, the subgroup of O tsutsugamushi patients identified by NGS-based detection was associated with higher ALT and BUN compared with patients who were identified by serology ( Fig 3E ). Pharyngitis was also more common with DENV, occurring in 52%. Cough was universally present in patients identified with K. pneumoniae or AFB infection, and patients with AFB were also more likely to have elevated platelet count, low creatinine, low chloride, and hyponatremia whereas patients identified with K. pneumoniae had significantly lower AST levels than patients with other infections. Hyponatremia was statistically associated with B. pseudomallei infection as well, as was hyperglycemia. Patients testing positive for leptospirosis reported confusion (40%), and had significantly lower albumin levels. Lactate was significantly higher in patients testing positive for E. coli. Patients without an identified pathogen were significantly less likely to have presented with rigors, dizziness, and cough.  (A) Normalized read counts mapping to the top 5 microbes detected by GOTTCHA at the species level are presented for patients adjudicated with Orientia tsutsugamushi infection. Sequencing was performed on blood collected at initial hospital entry. Patient samples are ordered by method of adjudication: IgG seroconversion, IgM seroconversion, 4-fold IgM titer increase, or IgM positive with no convalescent sample. (B) Mapping O. tsutsugamushi positive reads to a reference genome (NCBI Accession: NC_010793) demonstrates high coverage in two regions representing 16S (C) and 23S (D) ribosomal RNA. (E) Acute IgM, Blood Urea Nitrogen (bun; mg/dL), and Alanine Aminotransferase (ast; U/L) measurements for O. tsutsugamushi are presented for patients grouped by NGS-based detection where group 1, colored white, indicates no detection by NGS, and group 2, colored red, indicates O. tsutsugamushi was detected by all taxonomy tools.  In order to detect potential etiological agents of sepsis in a broad and unbiased manner, RNAseq was performed on all acute whole blood samples. Microbes were identified using read-based taxonomy tools embedded in EDGE bioinformatics software [ 36 , 43 ]. O. tsutsugamushi was one of the most common pathogens detected by sequencing. Laboratory analysis demonstrated that numerous patients were IgM positive for O. tsutsugamushi at the time of presentation, potentially indicating scrub typhus as the reason for their hospitalization. However, for patients who succumbed to infection or were lost to follow up, confirmation of seroconversion was not possible due to the lack of convalescent sera. Serology results were paired with RNAseq data to determine if NGS-based pathogen detection could assist etiological characterization of clinical samples. GOTTCHA, the most specific NGS-based classification tool of the tools used in this study, identified O. tsutsugamushi as a prevalent microbe in eight patient samples ( Fig 3A ), seven of which were from patients exhibiting elevated acute IgM titers but for whom 28-day follow-up samples were nonexistent. GOTTCHA results are supported by two additional taxonomy tools ( S1 Fig , S2 Fig ). To support O. tsutsugamushi positive calls, reads that aligned to the O. tsutsugamushi genome by BWA mapping to RefSeq were extracted and mapped to a reference genome. The majority of reads map to the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA regions of the reference genome rather than throughout the coding regions of O. tsutsugamushi reference genomes ( Fig 3B–3D ; S3 Fig ). These additional seven O. tsutsugamushi infections confirmed by NGS bring the total number of O. tsutsugamushi infections to sixteen.  In addition to direct detection of etiological agents from patient samples (i.e., culture, microscopy, PCR), immunological analyses were applied to detect serological evidence of infection for a variety of regionally important pathogens. Laboratory analyses of patient sera also detected seroconversion to viral and bacterial infections in 54 patients. Serological evidence of a viral infection was detected in 29 (14.5%) patients. Antibodies against DENV were most commonly identified (n = 20), followed by antibodies to CHIKV (n = 9); three patients were seropositive for both viruses.  The overwhelming majority of organisms detected were consistent with community-acquired infections by clinical adjudication. Of the subjects with bacterial pathogens isolated, only seven were transferred from an outside hospital, and of these, only three were judged to have a clinical course prior to enrollment (including exposure at an outside hospital) so that nosocomial infection could not be ruled out. These subjects had two Klebsiella and one Haemophilus infection confirmed by culture.  Potential co-infections indicated in 35 out of 200 patients. Each column, numbered 1–35 indicate the results from an individual patient. Colored boxes indicate a positive result from each patient for the pathogen listed in the first column, and the color of the box in the key below indicates the methodology used to detect evidence of that pathogen.  Culture positively identified several bacterial coinfections as well ( Fig 2 ). Based upon clinical adjudication, our clinical reviewers could not identify a definitive single causative pathogen in these cases. In many subjects with multiple isolated pathogens, coinfection was plausible, as in Subject 29 ( Fig 2 ) with apparent underlying lung disease and the identification of both AFB and K. pneumoniae in sputum. E. coli and K. pneumoniae were cultured from the blood of one patient; E. coli was co-cultured with Proteus mirabilis from another patient. H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae were each cultured from the sputum of a single patient; K. pneumoniae and B. pseudomallei were both isolated from another single patient. Two patients with acid-fast bacilli present in their sputum samples were also sputum culture positive for K. pneumoniae (n = 1) and K. ozeane (n = 1). Finally, one patient was culture positive for three bacteria: K. pneumoniae (sputum), Achromabacter xylosoxidans (blood), and P. aeruginosa (sputum).  In addition to infectious etiologies identified by culture, microscopy identified seven patients with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) present in sputum smears. Because the presence of AFB in sputum is considered indicative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, these patients were treated as tuberculosis (TB) patients [ 40 ]. Microscopy also identified Plasmodium species in three patients. Two patients were blood culture negative for bacteria but had serum DNA PCR positive for H. influenzae (n = 1) and S. pneumoniae (n = 1). Likewise, PCR analysis on RNA isolated from patient sera also positively identified infection with DENV in a single patient, although this patient was serum antibody negative. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was confirmed in one patient through the detection of HBV surface antigens using the HBsAg Rapid Test, but this patient’s clinical picture was consistent with chronic HBV infection. Next generation diagnostics for melioidosis identified B. pseudomallei infections from an additional 12 culture negative patients. Eight of these patients produced melioidosis iSTAT results well over the previously established cutoff for 100% specificity and the remaining four were greater than 93% assay specificity [ 17 ]. These culture negative melioidosis patients bring the total number to 23 melioidosis cases.  A combination of culture, microscopy, and molecular techniques positively identified an infectious cause of disease in 49/200 patients (24.5%). With culture from all potential culture sites (blood, sputum, CSF, wound), 41 bacterial isolates and one yeast were obtained from 32/200 (16%) patients ( Table 3 ). Sputum and blood culture ( Table 3 ) produced similar numbers (18 and 20 respectively), followed by wound (n = 2) and cerebral spinal fluid (n = 1). Gram-negative bacteria (n = 33) dominated the culture results, with B. pseudomallei being the most commonly isolated pathogen (eight from blood, three from sputum), including seven patients previously described in detail [ 14 ]. Other notable gram-negative infections included Klebsiella pneumoniae (seven from sputum, one from blood), Escherichia coli (five from blood), H. influenzae (two from sputum), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two from sputum). Gram-positive bacteria were rare in this cohort; only three Staphylococcus aureus isolates (two from sputum, one from wound) and one S. suis isolate (CSF) were obtained. Also cultured, although at lower frequencies, were Proteus mirabilis (1), S. typhi (1), Klebsiella ozaenae (1), Achromobacter xylosoxidans (1), and unknown species of Enterobacter (1), Acinetobacter (1), and Candida (non-albicans).  Out of 200 patients, 93 patients (46.5%) received at least one microbiological diagnosis after all testing and adjudication was completed. Our retrospective clinical adjudication process identified a large number of the remaining patients as having suspected infections. Our panel adjudicated four patients to have a non-infectious cause of their illness. Of the 103 patients with no pathogen attributed to their illness, 92 (89%) were adjudicated to have infectious, or likely infectious, causes of their hospitalization. Using diagnostic assays available at the hospital microbiology lab (culture, microscopy) we were able to diagnose 38 patients. Thus 55 (59%) of our final 93 adjudicated microbiological diagnoses were made only with our more advanced serological and molecular assays or sequencing.  Patients originated from eight provinces in the southern and western parts of Cambodia; Takeo, Kampot, Kampong Speu, Kandal, Preah Sihanouk, Prey Veng, Koh Kong, and Battambang. The majority of patients were rice farmers (n = 109/200, 54.5%) or were not employed outside the home (n = 25/200, 12.5%) ( S1 Table ). Of those who reported their education level, 93/200 (46.5%) had received a primary education (Grade 1–6), while 52/200 (26%) had received no education. The majority of patients had no sick family members or friends (n = 160/200, 80%). Contact with cattle (n = 28/200, 14%), dogs (n = 7/200, 3.5%) and pigs (n = 7/200, 3.5%) were the most commonly described animal exposures. Of the patients enrolled, 115/200 (57.5%) were enrolled during the rainy season (May through October). The most common symptoms reported by enrolled patients included fatigue (n = 175/200, 87.5%), anorexia (n = 153/200, 76.5%), shortness of breath (n = 142/200, 71%), excessive sweating (n = 136/200, 68%), shaking/rigors (n = 133/200, 66.5%), headache (n = 132/200, 66%), cough (n = 123/200, 61.5%), and abdominal pain (n = 110/200, 55%) ( S2 Table ). Of the 174 patients who consented to an HIV test, 12/174 (6.9%) were positive.  From May 30, 2014 to November 18, 2015 345 patients presenting to Takeo Provincial Hospital were screened for inclusion in the study [ 14 ]. One hundred forty-five patients were excluded from the study for specific reasons detailed in Fig 1 . Ultimately, 200 patients were enrolled. Prior to enrollment, 46% (92/200) were receiving unpaid medical care in the home (i.e., family), 38.5% (77/200) were receiving paid professional care in the home, and the remainder (31/200, 15.5%) were receiving care from other clinics or hospitals. The median age was 50 (range 18–83) and the majority were male (n = 136, 68%) ( Table 2 ). Thermodysregulation was present in 74.5% of patients, while 86.5% presented with elevated heart rate, and 99.5% with elevated respiratory rate. The median duration for hospital stay was 8 days (range 1–83), with the majority of patients (n = 173/200, 86.5%) at TPH for fewer than 16 days. Of the 182 patients for whom there was definitive 28-day data, 22 died, resulting in a 28-day fatality rate of 12.1%. At total of seven patients died prior to hospital discharge, with another six patients dying within a week of discharge. At 1-year follow-up, 42 of 122 (34%) patients had died. The median time to death was 26 days (range 1–342).  Discussion  In this prospective study of 200 sepsis patients presenting to a provincial referral hospital in southeastern Cambodia, we detected 139 infections in 93 (46.5%) patients (Table 3). An infectious source was directly detected for 19 pathogens in 53 patients; serological evidence suggests infection with 7 pathogens in 54 patients and next generation sequencing verified the serology results in 8 patients. By coupling standard clinical microbiology practices with newer molecular diagnostics and next-generation sequencing, we were able to identify a causative pathogen in 46.5% of cases. A viral source was identified in 26 (13%) patients and bacterial source in 79 (39.5%) patients.  In this study we demonstrate that NGS-based detection enabled a diagnosis for some patients who were either culture negative, lacked convalescent serum specimens for paired serological analysis, or were otherwise undiagnosed by more traditional methods. By targeting RNA we focused the sequencing space on actively replicating transcripts indicative of replicating bacteria and, thus, active infection. O. tsutsugamushi was one of the most common pathogens detected by sequencing and was identified in seven patients where only the acute phase sample existed. We also detected DENV in the patient sample which yielded a positive PCR result (described above). The sequence data for DENV was so robust that 99.85% of the genome was sequenced, enabling detailed identification as DENV1 Strain 00407/95 accession JN638344.  To further investigate the utility of NGS-aided diagnostics for sepsis, O. tsutsugamushi-positive patient data were evaluated in detail. In the present cohort, a combination of serological analyses and NGS identified a total of sixteen O. tsutsugamushi-patients. Acute and convalescent blood draws led to confirmed serological diagnosis of O. tsutsugamushi for nine patients. Sequencing identified O. tsutsugamushi as the most prevalent microbe represented in blood RNA from seven additional study participants. All seven NGS-positive patients had high IgM titers in acute samples but lacked convalescent samples to complete serological analysis. In one case, a patient identified by serology with a four-fold increase in titer was confirmed by the detection of O. tsutsugamushi sequences by NGS. Presumably, detection of pathogen sequences is indicative of higher bacterial burden. Consistent with this hypothesis, patients with pathogen sequences detected by NGS were associated with more severe disease presentations as determined by clinical laboratory values (Tables 4 and 5; Fig 3E). Taken together, the results suggest that adopting a sequence-based detection method, global or targeted, in combination with traditional point-of-care blood panels could improve adjudication and time-to-diagnosis in future sepsis surveillance studies.  One distinction of our study is the depth and breadth of clinical data collected from the patient cohort over the time course of the study. These data allow a much richer appreciation of the clinical features of severe infection in Cambodia and allowed us to investigate specific associations with particular pathogens. For example, data from our 200-patient cohort (that included 11 culture-confirmed B. pseudomallei infections) is consistent with our previous observation that hyponatremia appeared to be disproportionately present in the first seven melioidosis cases [14]. Although hyponatremia is frequently associated with legionellosis and more severe community acquired pneumonia, the pathophysiologic mechanism is poorly understood [44–46]. Our data are insufficient to allow correlation of sodium level with presence or severity of pneumonia or whether the association with B. pseudomallei infection is independent of pulmonary involvement, thus further study is warranted. Tuberculosis patients were the only others with a statistically significant hyponatremia. TB patients also had a marked thrombocytosis and low creatinine compared to other patients, likely representing a more chronic inflammatory and catabolic state. Finally, patients with evidence of O. tsutsugamushi infection appeared to have a cluster of signs and symptoms that were more strongly associated with O. tsutsugamushi infection than other etiologies. This constellation included retro-orbital pain, visual disturbance, sore throat, myalgia, abdominal pain, rash, and BUN and AST elevation. We did not find a statistical association between O. tsutsugamushi and thrombocytopenia, although this is commonly ascribed [47]. The predilection of scrub typhus to present with liver and kidney abnormalities is consistent with the known clinical syndrome. The hypocalcemia noted was total calcium levels and thus likely proportional to hypoalbuminemia in those subjects. While our sample size is insufficient to make statistically significant conclusions about the disease-diagnostic utility of clinical laboratory values, many of our observations are consistent with prior descriptions of pathogen-associated syndromes and have biological plausibility to support a true association. These associated symptoms and laboratory values, and particular combinations thereof, deserve further investigation to determine whether clinical diagnostic criteria could help to identify patients more likely to have a specific pathogen where antimicrobial selection may differ (e.g. doxycycline for O. tsutsugamushi or ceftazidime for B. pseudomallei) and where timely microbiologic diagnosis is routinely unavailable in resource-limited hospitals.  RNA sequencing contributed to the depth of our dataset and aided in retrospective diagnosis of patients who succumbed to their illness or failed to return after hospital discharge. More real-time sequencing methods could eventually provide enhanced diagnostic ability, however, foreseeable techniques for sequencing-aided diagnosis will suffer from a number of limitations that we probably encountered in our study. Blood levels of circulating pathogens (and thus pathogen nucleic acid sequences) differ throughout the course of illness. Patients who are ill may have a bacterial or viral burden under the limit of detection of nucleotide-based methods. The liberal availability and wide-spread use of antibiotics in the general community in Takeo Province may also suppress bacteremia and sensitivity of sequencing, and many of our patients had self-treated with antibiotics prior to hospital presentation. Furthermore, resources limitations including space, consistent power, reliable cold chain and staff training make wide-spread use of real-time sequencing in resource-limited settings unlikely in the foreseeable future. As molecular (and sequenced-based) diagnostic testing methods become more widely available, clinicians must continue to learn how these methods provide useful diagnostic information and where increased sensitivity may also detect clinically insignificant infection and co-infection. Ten of the sixteen patients diagnosed with O. tsutsugamushi were adjudicated as having probable or possible co-infections, and it is possible that hospital admittance was driven by illness caused by a different pathogen. Finally, E. coli sequences were ubiquitously present in the samples. Because E. coli DNA is a common contaminant of laboratory reagents [48], we suspect that widespread detection of E. coli is a byproduct of sample processing. Consistent with that hypothesis, none of these patients had positive blood cultures for E. coli.  One limitation of our study is our reliance on serological evidence of infection for certain pathogens, with its inherent difficulty in interpretation and potential for false positives. Coinfection was suggested by serologic assays in over 10% of our patients, and in some instances, the likelihood of true coinfection versus false-positive serology was impossible to discern. For instance, the association of positive leptospirosis serology with culture-confirmed B. pseudomallei infection may reflect a common water source as a well-characterized risk factor for both. To improve accuracy, we followed CDC diagnostic guidelines for serum-only diagnoses and utilized recombinant antigens with no known cross-reactivity to other organisms [25, 27, 29]. Because background seropositivity for many pathogens we tested (spotted fever group rickettsia and Leptospira spp., for example) is high in this area, we applied high cutoff values and rigorous standards for our serum-only diagnoses.  We observed a relatively low rate of positive blood cultures and very few gram-positive organisms. We believe this is due to self-medication through the purchase of over-the-counter antibiotics, which is common in the region [49–51]. In fact, 70% (140/200) reported use of antibacterial agents prior to enrollment in the study and only 26 of those (18.5%) were referred from another hospital. Additionally, we believe that B. pseudomallei is underrepresented in our cohort. Melioidosis is diagnosed with the greatest success utilizing a “head-to-toe” culture approach. In our cohort, sputum cultures were not available for the first seven months of the study, leaving blood as the only biospecimen cultured during that time period. Finally, this study was conducted at a relatively small referral hospital at a single location in Cambodia and should not be considered a comprehensive representation of sepsis-causing organisms throughout Cambodia.  In this study, we present the most detailed characterization to date of sepsis and microbiological cause for southern Cambodia. The clinical associations we found may have significant impact in developing clinical prediction tools that may more accurately direct early antimicrobial selection and clinical decision making. It is important to note that not only did the utilization of serological, molecular and sequencing data essentially double our diagnostic yield, but these techniques were able to detect a number of pathogens that would necessitate different antimicrobial selection from common empiric therapy. Clearly, the serological and sequencing platforms are currently unable to yield real-time diagnostic data that can guide clinical decision making for a sepsis cohort in this region, and despite a multi-pronged approach for adjudication, 52.5% of the cohort remained undiagnosed. These facts highlight the urgent need for new infectious disease diagnostics that can identify infections in near real time. Such tools are even more important in resource-limited environments such as Takeo, where empiric antimicrobial selection is necessarily restricted by cost. In our study, we detected B. pseudomallei, O. tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia spp., or Coxiella burnetti in 26% of patients–diagnoses that would significantly alter antimicrobial management, resulting in improved outcomes. In addition, we detected only viral pathogens in 13 (6.5%), knowledge which could prompt withholding of antibiotic therapy, improved antimicrobial stewardship, and lower risk of emerging antimicrobial resistance. More research is needed to continue our understanding of causes and manifestations of sepsis in Southeast Asia, develop improved clinical predictors of specific syndromes, and most importantly to develop new diagnostic tools to facilitate management in resource limited settings."

[Operator instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Nathan Judge.  Thank you, and over to you, sir.  Nathan Judge -- Head of Investor Relations  Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On Thursday evening, the company issued a press release announcing its fiscal results for the fiscal first quarter of 2021 ended June 30, 2020. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the investors' section of Azure Power's website at azurepower.com. With me today are Ranjit Gupta, CEO; Murali Subramanian, COO; and Pawan Agrawal, CFO.  Ranjit will start the call by going through the recent key highlights and comment on recent market trends in auctions. Murali then will follow with an update on our projects under construction and an industry update. Pawan will then follow and provide an update on the quarter, and then we will wrap up the call with Ranjit reiterating fiscal year 2021 guidance, as well as our longer-term guidance. After this, we will open up the call for questions.  Please note, our safe harbor statements are contained within our press release, presentation materials and available on our website. These statements are important and integral to all our remarks. There are risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. So, we encourage you to review the press release we furnished in our Form 6-K and presentation on our website for a more complete description.  Also contained in our press release, presentation materials and annual report are certain non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to the most comparable GAAP measures, and these reconciliations are also available on our website in the press release, presentation materials and annual report. And with that, it's now my pleasure to hand it over to Ranjit.  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Thank you, Nathan, and a very good morning, everyone. Despite our hope that progress will be made in quashing COVID-19 during the time since we last spoke, the pandemic continues to worsen. Our heartfelt best wishes to everyone during this difficult time, and we pray that a vaccine or cure can be found quickly. Murali and I completed our first hectic and rewarding year at Azure about four weeks ago.  We strongly believe Azure is moving in the right direction, is in the right market, and has the right team and the right shareholders to power its growth to the next level. As mentioned in the past, we continue to be focused on returns much more than megawatts and hope to see results of actions we have taken, over the last four quarters, in the coming year. Even before I talk number starting on Page 3, I would like to spend time on our sustainability efforts. On the sustainability front, we are pleased to report that Azure recently received recognition as the most sustainable company in the solar energy industry by World Finance magazine.  We also received a rating upgrade from Sustainalytics. Azure is now ranked as the 10th Best Renewable Company globally and in the top 5% of all utilities by Sustainalytics. This was a notable increase from our rating in November and has been a real testament to the team's efforts to provide disclosure on all the good work being done on the ground. We are not stopping there.  We are actioning a plan that we expect will drive an even better rating by year-end, including a more comprehensive sustainability report by the end of August and implementing new policies on freedom of association, human rights, diversity and inclusion. We plan to join the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure, become a UN Global Compact signatory, and we are contributing to the Carbon Disclosure Project. Given our better standing with ESG rating agencies, combined with recently improved average daily trading volume and a market cap of over $1 billion, we believe we will increasingly be eligible for ESG indices. All of this should enhance our visibility with investors that are looking for strong, sustainable companies to invest in.  Looking at the company, we are pleased to announce a very strong quarter despite challenges of the pandemic. The cash flow to equity, CFE, from our operating assets grew 45% year to year to USD 21.7 million. We benefited this quarter from lower costs, which has been a strong focus of ours since we joined a little over a year ago. Corporate overhead was down 30% compared to the same quarter last year, even though we are operating 21% more megawatts on a DC basis.  We continue to be confident about future growth and expect that CFE will be about USD 170 million to USD 210 million annually once our 7.1 gigawatt portfolio is completed. Also today, we are increasing the midpoint of the present value of equity for our 7.1 gigawatts by $100 million or about $2 per share to $1.75 billion to reflect falling interest rates. This compares to our current market cap of around $1 billion. We now expect that we will be able to realize interest rates of about 9.5% for new projects given recent pricing and transactions, compared to our previous assumption that we would realize an average rate of 10%.  Declining base rates and tightening bond yields for our green bonds and investment-grade Indian renewable companies bodes well for lower financing costs. Currently, we are seeing lenders offer us terms for around 9 to 9.5%, at least 50 basis points lower than rates we saw at the beginning of the year. In fact, we recently closed a foreign debt fully hedged facility that has an interest rate of approximately 8.5% in INR terms, just received a sanction from a large Indian lender at an interest rate of around 9.5% and refinanced about $40 million of debt with an interest rate of 9.7%. As a reminder, there is a significant uplift to our equity valuation for lower interest rates.  We are also reducing our long-term net debt projections by about $100 million to reflect the additional cash generation related to our expectations of lower interest rates. As many have seen, we have received a letter of award for the two-gigawatt greenshoe capacity we had optioned for as part of an auction we won in December 2019. It is clear that the delays associated with getting the LOA will delay the timing of signing of the PPA. SECI has taken the initiative to bundle power from these projects with current auctions to prevent tariff shopping by distribution companies.  Once the power sale agreements with distribution companies are consummated, our PPAs will be signed soon after. There is strong political will to get this in place as it will give a tremendous boost to the domestic solar cell and module manufacturing base in India. The implementation of safeguard duty, the proposed basic custom duty and other non-tariff restrictions, such as ALMM, approved list of modules and models are all designed to boost India's solar manufacturing base. The 12 gigawatts of manufacturing-linked tenders, which includes our four gigawatts, are a cornerstone of the central government's plans to propel India's solar manufacturing into a global leadership position.  The tariff of our four-gigawatt power also makes economic sense as well. As a reminder, the four gigawatts interstate transmission system transmission charges and loss waiver that is otherwise scheduled to expire in mid-2023 around the time when our first gigawatts of the four gigawatts will begin producing at full utilization. Without the ISTS transmission waiver, discounts will incur about INR 1 to INR 2 per unit of transmission costs, depending on the state, receiving the power, which makes delivered price of power from our four gigawatts comparative. If INR 1 to INR 2 per unit is added to the recent auction of a record low tariff of around INR 2.36 per unit, the realized cost of power would actually be around INR 3.4 to INR 4.4 per unit, which is 16 to 50% higher than the INR 2.92 per unit tariff for our four gigawatts.  In addition, we would note that many DISCOMs are well short of meeting their renewable purchase obligations for the next several years. We expect them to buy renewable power that is available and a blended tariff from SECI with an ISTS waiver as one of the lowest cost options. We will continue to update investors as things develop. As part of our commitment of pursuing the lowest cost source of capital, the process of selling assets continues.  The process is ongoing. And although we do not have anything to announce as yet, but we continue to believe that we will be able to sell the assets well before additional equity is needed and will update the market as soon as any material change occurs. We continue to expect that we will not issue any new shares before fiscal 2022 unless this becomes the cheapest source of capital. As part of our efforts to improve the depth and diversity of our board, we are pleased that Ms.  Supriya San has joined our board recently as a non-executive independent director. The amount of experience she has with raising capital for green energy projects, her extensive work with nonprofits helping children in Cambodia and Singapore and her focus on governance and sustainability will all be a welcome addition to our board. As of date, we currently have 10 board members, of which six are deemed independent and of which two are female. Looking at Page 4.  As we have said many times since we joined a little over a year ago, we remain very committed to creating shareholder value. Supporting this commitment are two basic principles to which we strictly adhere to. No. 1, all projects must earn a return above our cost of capital.  And No. 2, we will pursue with the lowest cost of capital. We do want to reiterate our commitment to capital discipline. Put simply, we will not do any project that does not earn a return over our cost of capital.  The delay in receiving PPA for the four gigawatts has opened up a gap in our construction time lines, and we have been recently bidding for new projects. However, we will not win projects just for growth's sake or to create work for ourselves. Rest assured that we will only win projects that, with conservative assumptions, will deliver returns that exceed our cost of capital. In fact, we chose to not chase after megawatts in a recent auction that reached a record low ground mount solar tariffs of INR 2.36 per unit or about $0.031, as the expected returns did not meet our minimum threshold.  We recognize that any particular project has a large impact on the companywide cost of capital, and even one project can undermine investor confidence, resulting in much larger reverberation to our company. In addition, we will only bid on projects that have the best counterparties. NTPC is AAA-rated and is central government owned. SECI is also central government owned and has a AA+ rating.  Gujarat and Bangalore have the highest ratings of any states DISCOM and typically pay their bills within 15 days or less. There is significant growth potential with just these parties and we will be assured prompt payments. As we resume bidding for new projects, we have been focused on where we have advantages to our competition. We have identified several sites where we can reduce our construction costs, including through expansion of existing operating projects to leverage common infrastructure and capitalize on operating and maintenance synergies.  In addition, our access to lower cost capital is superior to most of our peers, which we believe will increasingly provide a greater competitive advantage going forward. Looking at the current market today, we would highlight that construction costs have fallen pretty meaningfully in just six months. Module prices have come off around 10% and we are now expecting our total project costs will be around 8 to 10% lower than our December expectations. Along with falling project costs, declining benchmark rates and tightening bond yields bodes well for lower financing costs, as mentioned earlier.  So, while headline tariffs are indeed lower, they make sense as costs are falling as well. As many of us continue to work from home, we have benefited from being able to talk to our investor and shareholder community a lot more than when we were able to travel. Please rest assured that every interaction is important to us, and we strive to consider all suggestions and requests we get for enhancing value of your company. We continue to improve our disclosures, which will enable you to better understand your company.  With that, I will pass it over to Murali.  Murali Subramanian -- Chief Operating Officer  Thank you, Ranjit. Good morning, everybody. This is Murali here. If you see Page 5, Azure's business has remained very stable during the COVID-19 pandemic.  And so far, there have been no material adverse impacts from the economic and financial market disruption. Our plants remain fully operational and have continued to see customers making payments as normal. The plant's performance for the quarter has matched expectations despite the temporary drop in electricity demand in the early part of the pandemic-induced lockdowns in the months of April and May, and despite the monsoon activity in the month of June. And we haven't had any abnormal downtime related to non-availability of spares despite the lockdown.  Further, we have restarted our work related to our plan of digitalization of our operations, especially around drone-based panel monitoring, performance analytics, robot module cleaning and the like. Activity has begun in earnest at our under-construction projects, and we are seeing the workforce starting to return to sites. Compared to our last call, the activity has picked up significantly though we are not yet back to our targeted activity levels. However, we are making much better progress.  The Ministry of Power has given a five-month extension for completion of renewable energy plants and transmission projects, which is additional two months extension from before. Another important development we expect soon is the alignment of plant commissioning dates with the dates of power evacuation, which dates -- power evacuation will be available, which aligns construction programs of the plants with the commissioning of the evacuation infrastructure. All the ground mount projects we are working on are expected to be completed by the expected revised COD dates, and we don't expect to pay any delay related penalty for COVID-related delays. Further, the time of commissioning of our under-construction projects does not impact our revenues we expect during the 25-year PPA because revenues begin at the date of commissioning.  Looking at industry and regulatory developments on Page 6, we still see significant demand for new renewable energy in India despite recent events. During the quarter, there was nearly six gigawatts of new tenders released and five gigawatts of solar capacity auctioned. We did see lower tariffs this quarter, which directly reflect the lower construction costs as discussed earlier. There was a six-month extension to the ISTS waiver until June 2023, but the central government has indicated that this would be the final extension granted.  Related to our four gigawatt pipeline, the orders specifically mentioned and reconfirmed that our projects would be exempt from any ISTS charges or losses even beyond 2023. The central government has also begun disbursements of the $12 billion liquidity infusion scheme to help state utilities pay their bills. The disbursement will go directly to the generators from PFC and REC, financial institutions of India -- government of India, circumventing the DISCOMs. Fortunately, our customer profile is better than average, so we are not likely to see much direct benefit from this but it should provide investors additional comfort that the central government considers timely payment important and will take steps to help, if needed.  On to duties, the safeguard duty, SGD, was extended for another year at 14.9% for six months and then to 14.5% for the next six months. In addition, we expect that the basic custom duty, BCD, could be imposed soon and this would be in addition to the SGD. We do not expect any material impact to our returns on our projects as they are protected by change-in-law provisions. Further, I'm happy to report that we have started receiving payments against SGD deposited by us in the Rajasthan 5 project and the Maharashtra 3 project commission last year.  We have also received payments for recovery of GST in the Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh projects. These payments are a testament to the robust regulatory framework in place in the renewable energy sector in India. In fact, the Ministry of Power is implementing some changes to speed up the process of recovery even further. They are looking to apply a standard formula that reduces ambiguity and paperwork related to recovery, which we expect will reduce our working capital requirement.  In the new PPAs, there is already a standard formula available, which enhances tariff for every unit of extra capex expanded on duties that qualify for recovery under change in law. We continue to see lenders willing to increase loan sizes to fund SGD given higher certainty of recovery. With that, I will turn it to Pawan to discuss the quarterly results. Pawan, to you.  Pawan Agrawal -- Chief Financial Officer  Thank you, Murali. Turning to Page 7. As of June 30, 2020, we were operating 1,809 megawatts on a PPA or AC basis, which is about 12% more than the end of first quarter of June 2019. And on a '19 -- on a DC basis, we added a 21% more capacity as compared to the same quarter last year.  This increase in capacity, combined with about 160-basis-point improvement in our PLF and a recovery of about $1 million related to safeguard duty and GST refunds, drove a 16% increase in revenue from the same quarter last year. Costs were much lower this quarter than we have seen in a very, very long time. In fact, our O&M and G&A expenses were about a quarter less than the same period last year despite operating 21% more DC capacity. There are several things causing this.  First, we are very focused on reducing our costs as we had outlined earlier this year. We do continue to expect to see a reduction in our corporate overheads or G&A of at least 10% in FY '21 versus FY '22. Second, due to COVID-19, some activities were deferred on to future periods. Travel was significantly lower during this quarter and legal expenses were less because there were fewer obligations and court hearings.  We do expect that we will see an uptick of about $1.4 million in O&M and G&A from the first quarter of fiscal 2021 levels as we have seen a resumption of activity back toward more normal levels. Also, for Q2, we also expect that we will incur about 3 to $5 million of additional compensation expense in second-quarter 2021 related to stock appreciation rights granted to our CEO and COO, which is directly tied to the 30% increase in the stock price during the current quarter so far. Given all these variables, we are expecting G&A to be between 8 to $10 million in second quarter of FY '21, although this will be a function of the share price. As a rule of thumb, for every $1 increase in the share price, our G&A will increase by about $0.5 million.  After adjusting for deferred expense of $1.4 million, our non-GAAP EBITDA was about $42 million, up 26% from the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Another item on our income statement this quarter was the $3.5 million onetime charge that we took to refinance some international debt. This refinancing will lower the impact of gains or losses from foreign exchange on our income statement going forward. We expect losses from forex to be around $0.5 million per quarter, which reflects the cost of entering into hedges.  After taking into consideration the adjustments noted above, we reported a net profit of USD 2.7 million or about 19% higher than last year. Moving on to Page 8 which reconciled this year-to-year changes in our cash flow to equity from operating assets. Our CFE rose 45% year to year to $27.7 million. Most of the increase reflected higher revenues, but another large contribution was driven by lower cost on our platform.  On Page 9, at the end of the June quarter, we had 105.5 million of cash in hand. Combined with the 290 million of undrawn project debt commitments, we continue to have a strong liquidity position. Our plants under construction have full equity funding. We continue to expect that we will not use -- will not issue shares before fiscal year 2022.  We would also like to highlight the value of our hedges related to our green bonds as we believe many investors and analysts miss this substantial value of close to 100-odd million. We have seen some net debt calculations that take our gross rate of roughly 1.2 billion and subtract only the 105 million cash that we have in our hands. However, another 98 million hedging asset, which is classified under other assets in our balance sheet, that should also be taken into consideration to bring net debt down to around 1 billion. The hedging asset will go directly to offset our debt when our green bonds mature in 2022 and 2024.  Before I pass it over to Ranjit to discuss guidance, I want to make a moment -- I want to take a moment and discuss our DSO on Page 10. Our DSO did increase this quarter to 139 days from 126 days last quarter. However, as with previous quarters, all of this increase was because of two effects: a 50-megawatt asset in Andhra Pradesh and a 130-megawatt asset in Karnataka. Excluding these two assets, where we have seen delays in payments happening which represent about 10% of our total portfolio currently and this percentage will go down significantly as we construct new portfolio because new projects are from SECI, primarily from SECI, our DSO would have been about 90 days.  We continue to work on resolving payment issues with Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. And once we have these counterparties caught up, our DSOs would improve meaningfully. I would now like to turn it over to Ranjit to provide some commentary on FY '21 and long-term guidance. Over to you, Ranjit.  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Thank you, Pawan. On Page 11, we are reiterating our FY 2021 guidance at this time as over 90% of the revenues is expected to come from projects already commissioned and operating which have not been materially impacted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our remaining revenue is subject to when plants under construction are completed, and completion time lines are currently more difficult to forecast due to COVID-19, though we continue to make progress with our plants under construction. Without any contribution from plants under construction in financial year '21, revenues from operating facilities should be around INR 14.6 billion to INR 15 billion.  For second quarter '21, we expect revenue to be between INR 3.2 billion and INR 3.4 billion and the PLF to be between 18 to 19%. Turning to our long-term guidance on Page 12, a couple of things we would point out. Our capex budget for next year is likely to be lower than fiscal 2021 given the timing of signing PPAs. As a result, we have put in a placeholder for some projects to be built in FY '22, although as stated earlier, we will only do good projects that make sense and this placeholder is not really a commitment.  With this, we will be happy to take questions. Thank you very much.  Questions & Answers:  Operator  [Operator instructions] The first question is from the line of Philip Shen from ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.  Philip Shen -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst  Hi, everyone. Thanks for the questions, and congrats on doing some nice -- providing some nice results in this tough time. A quick question on the four gigawatts that you have secured now in LOAs. Can you share the plan for when you expect to sign the PPAs? Sorry if I missed it in your prepared remarks.  And then, you also talked about a potential construction gap. What might be some derivative issues that that causes? How do you expect to manage through that gap? Are you able to kind of put people on hold or furlough people and then kind of rehire them back? Or how do you expect to manage through that?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Thanks, Phil, very important questions. On the first question, the power purchase agreement, we received LOA only in about three or four weeks ago or less than three weeks ago. So, SECI, once final -- this is the final LOA in the 12,000 megawatts, 12-gigawatt manufacturing tender. So, once this LOA was placed, SECI started the process of tracing this power, right? So in the first tranche, they are trying to place more urgently the power off the 12 gigawatts that is supposed to be commissioned in 2022 calendar.  We expect that they have just started. And unfortunately, because of pandemic, many of the distribution companies are also, officers working from home kind of thing. So, normally, this process takes -- from the time you get a LOA, normally, this process takes three months in a regular power purchase agreement construct. Because of the fact that this is a larger capacity and given that this is a time of pandemic, I would think that this will be between three to six months from the time that we have received our LOA.  That is what I expect. And because -- earlier, we were expecting to sign the first LOAs by June 2020 or so, because of the fact that the LOA got delayed and there is a delay, we expect that there'll be a little bit of a gap opening up in our construction schedule. Basically, what happens is that in the earlier plan, we were expecting that the first 1,000 megawatts will come sometime in the summer of 2022, whereas now they will come toward the latter half of 2022. So, there is maybe a three to six months delay which could happen in the commissioning of these first set of projects.  So that opens up a gap of three to six months for us. And if we can find the right projects, we will go out and take part in auctions and secure capacity. If we don't, it's not such a big deal, really, because we will still be busy with planning four gigawatts of capacity. So, as such, we don't really need to put anybody on furlough or rehire or anything of that sort.  We have a very lean team on the construction side anyways, so that time would be well used for safety trainings, for technical trainings, for project management trainings and preparing for the four gigawatts. So, the time is not long enough really for us to worry about it. It is just that there is a gap. And if we can fill it with the right projects, great.  If we cannot fill it, that's not a big deal.  Philip Shen -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst  OK. That's very helpful. As it relates to the DSOs, I know it's related to two specific projects. What's the path to resolving them? It's extending your DSOs substantially.  And can you share a little bit of color on the specific situation with these projects and how you expect the situation to resolve?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Right. So, in the prepared remarks, Pawan mentioned two projects, the 50 megawatts in Andhra and 130 megawatts in Karnataka. In fact, out of the 130 megawatts, 50 megawatts pays us regularly. So, it's only 80 megawatts that is delayed.  In that 80 megawatts also, right, in the month of July and the beginning of August, we've got some substantial payments. So, therefore, when we are hopefully reporting September end numbers, our DSOs will be anyway better. Of those two distribution companies, GESCOM and HESCOM, we are in regulatory cohort to settle the matter. We had received a positive result with the third-party, which is now paying us on time at the beginning of the year, and we are hopeful that we will get a positive result with the second authority also.  So, therefore, we expect that that issue should get resolved maybe toward the latter half of this year. And as far as the third one is concerned, HESCOM, they do actually have some payment issues from their back-end, from their consumers. So, we are working with them to try and get payments. Like I mentioned, they paid 2 million just a couple of weeks back.  And we work for relationship building. We are building a stronger relationship with them so that they pay us on time, and that's what we are trying to do. As far as the Andhra Pradesh thing is concerned, that is 50 megawatts. It's a very small capacity for us.  They -- that is a larger industry issue. And that will take time to solve. So I'm comfortable with Karnataka. I think Karnataka is under control.  And over the next two months, we will have a better handle on Karnataka. But the 50 megawatts, I'm not so confident of. And I think it will take a little bit longer. It could get into the next year beginning before we are able to resolve Andhra.  But overall, that 50 megawatts, and by next year, we'll have 3,000 megawatts operating, so it's a very minuscule part of our portfolio. But nevertheless, that continues to be an issue which will take time to resolve.  Philip Shen -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst  OK. Great. One more, if I may. As it relates to module pricing, you highlighted that it has come down meaningfully.  In the recent weeks, module pricing and pricing in the whole supply chain is actually going higher. Have you guys started to experience higher module pricing recently? And also, could you update us on the type of modules you're using these days? Do you expect to use, for example, any mono PERC modules, or do you continue to use multi? Do you expect to maybe use even newer technology modules in the coming six to 12 months?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  OK. So, two questions. Phil, the first one, yes, even we have had our suppliers reach out to us for changing the contracts that we have signed with them over the last couple of weeks. So, there is one contract where we are constructing right now, so we need to get those modules, anyways.  But for that, we have opened many -- much of the letter of credits were open. So, we did not see much impact there. In another project, we were able to push out our deliveries by a few weeks because people, including the Chinese folks, expect that in the next few weeks, this situation will resolve itself. So, yes, we did hear from our suppliers, but we don't think it's a serious issue.  It's a temporary issue related to some supply constraints on the Chinese side. As far as the modules are concerned, Phil, we have -- these are the projects that we are constructing now are all mono PERC, 400 watt peak and above. We have shifted to mono completely for our new assets. We are also looking at bifacial.  We are also looking at higher capacities. We just got an offer yesterday or today, I think for 535 watt peak module. So typically, we will -- there are huge advantages for going with the latest technology, so we are always looking at what are the best modules that are available in the market at a particular given time, and we try and get those modules for ourselves because they bring us huge advantages in our BOS costing also.  Philip Shen -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst  Great. Thank you, Ranjit. I'll pass it on. Thank you.  Operator  We take the next question from the line of Maheep Mandloi from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.  Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst  Just on the SECI four-gigawatt project --  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Maheep, we are unable to hear you?  Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst  Can you guys hear me?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Yes. Yes, we can hear you now.  Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst  Yes. So, just on the SECI four-gigawatt project, can you just talk about the construction gap on the -- how much of the employees in the construction are permanent versus temporary? And if you use any third-party EPC or subcontractor. I just wanted to see how much of that construction gap would directly impact you versus some of it, which could be shared by your subcontractors or partners.  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  So Maheep, as far as the subcontractors are concerned, really, there is -- there's absolutely no issues at all because we are talking about completion of the construction of the 1,290-odd megawatts that we are doing now and the construction of the four gigawatts, right? So there is a gap there, which we are trying to fill if we can. So, we will -- obviously, once the power purchase agreements for the four gigawatts are signed, we will accordingly plan their construction, and the subcontractors and EP contractors will be awarded as and when we need to deliver those projects, right? So as far as the contractors are concerned, there is absolutely no issue. The issue, like I said, is only that about -- between three to six months is the gap that we are seeing opening up, and that is on account of we were expecting to get our PPAs signed the first round by June of 2020, which means that you would have had to deliver those projects by June of 2022. Now, instead of June of '22, if you -- if our PPA gets signed, for example, in September or October or November, we'll have to deliver in September, October and November of 2022, right? So it's not such a big deal, and we have -- I mean, maybe Murali can correct me, but not more than 20, 30 folks in construction team, so it's not really an issue.  I mean, the idea is not to get into contracts because you want to keep our team busy. We have plenty of work that we can get our team to do. And like I mentioned, we can get them trained up and so on and so forth. The idea is that we have an organization, we have the capital available, and we exist for building projects and operating projects.  So, if there is a gap and if that gap can be filled by projects that meet our returns, meet our cost of capital, then we will like to do projects because that's what we do. We are a developer, we build projects and operate projects. Otherwise, there is no real imperative for us at all to fill that gap.  Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst  Got it. And then, we saw the news recently on -- that you were selected for a 300-megawatt auction for NTPC. It was like one or two weeks ago. So, I just wanted to see if you have any more news to share on that on, say, the timing of the LOA or the PPA on those -- on that win? And will that be -- that kind of a project be the something which fills in that three to six months gap two years down the line?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Absolutely. Absolutely. So, if we get the LOA for that, we have -- as you might have read, we have not announced this yet because we don't have the LOA in hand. There is -- once the auction is held, then it goes through the board process of NTPC and so on, and they have to get their internal approvals before they give us an LOA.  So, therefore, we haven't announced it as yet. But yes, if we get the LOA and we get the PPA signed after that, I know once the LOA is given, with signed PPA with us, then yes, that project will be delivered sometime between March 2022 to June 2022, which will help us fill that gap that I was referring to.  Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst  Got it. And then, the -- PP on that one is around INR 2.48. So, I just wanted to see if that's in line with your expectations or are you seeing more competition on the PPAs as more auctions come online now?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Maheep, because we have this four gigawatts in the bag and we have our 3,000 megawatts that we expect to complete, competition really is not a big concern for us because it's just -- because competition brings the prices down. We don't need to go there and do projects that don't make sense for us. So, we are not -- to that extent, we are not worried about the competition. If the competition is too high and prices -- the tariffs become unsustainable, we will not bid.  We will consolidate our position. So the competition doesn't bother us. What bothers us only is that we want to be at the cutting edge of whatever is happening in the market, right? So we obviously -- if somebody is going to be competitive at INR 2.50 and we find that we are going to be competitive at only a INR 2.60, there is a problem, right? We need to figure out where we are going wrong. Are we not using the latest technology? Are we not using the best practices of construction? Are we using some different kind of equipment on our sites? That is the only thing that we have to worry about.  So, we track competition only to make sure that we are not left behind on the cost of construction or the cost of financing or the cost of procurement, but not so that we can beat the competition regardless of what our returns are. So that's where we are. I mean, we -- the tariffs that we have won the auction at, it makes sense for us. And like we have mentioned in the earnings release, we are targeting to do it co-located with another project, which will give us the advantage of cost and make the project viable for us.  Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst  Got it. And then, just two quick ones from me, and then I'll leave the questions for others. The equity needs for the 2.4 gigawatts or -- sorry, the capex needs for the four gigawatts was around $2.4 billion previously? And -- so do you see some improvements there now that you see 8 to 10% improvement in the system cost, which would potentially reduce your equity needs for that project? And a quick one, just trying to understand the utilization rates. You had a 23.1% utilization in the quarter on the run rate, 1,800 megawatts available in this quarter and the previous quarter, so that implies like around 900 gigawatt hours of energy generated.  So, I just wanted to see if I'm missing anything there in that calculation versus the energy reported in the quarter?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  So on the first one, as far as the capex is concerned, there is -- we have not changed that number as yet because it's still far into the future. But for sure, you are absolutely right, we are seeing a reduction in the capex, which is reflected in the tariffs that are being discovered in the last couple of tenders. So, we are very bullish. We are very happy to see that happen.  And we are hopeful that by the time we start building the four gigawatts, maybe two, three quarters from now, we will see that positively impact our returns and impact the requirement of equity such that we need lesser equity. As far as the second part of the question is concerned, I'll let Murali take that question. I didn't fully understand, perhaps Murali will be able to answer this better  Murali Subramanian -- Chief Operating Officer  The question if there is an error because we did report that 23% plus capacity utilization. So, whatever the energy corresponding to that that is definitely on. So, I'm just trying to see why you think there might be a mistake? If we made up error of, if at all. I don't think there is a mistake, but if it is there, then we'll probably correct.  Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst  No. No. Maybe, I'll just probably follow-up later on. Thank you.  Operator  The next question is from the line of Puneet Gulati from HSBC. Please go ahead.  Puneet Gulati -- HSBC -- Analyst  Yeah. Hi, good evening. I have one question with respect to the extension dates that you put. Is it a blanket extension, or do you have to go for each of the projects and ask for an extension date with respect to COVID?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  So Puneet, this is a blanket extension. In fact, it very clearly says that from the 25th of March to 24th of August, for these five months, the Ministry is giving this extension, which does not require any paperwork to be submitted by the developer. I can share the OMs with you off-line if you're interested.  Puneet Gulati -- HSBC -- Analyst  OK. That's great. And secondly, with respect to the SGD and GST related issues, how much payment should we still be expecting from the off-takers?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  It will depend upon the SGD and GST amount. So, for example, in case of the SECI projects, they are going to pay us back that money over a 13-year period as an annuity. So, every year -- so we've got some upfront payment for the time that we paid the money in July or June or August in last year till June this year. There was a -- for that one-year period, we got some money upfront in the month of July.  And then, now, every month, we are starting to get the annuity payment from SECI. So similarly, depending from -- if it is SECI, then this is a model that we will follow. If it is a state, like in case of Maharashtra, and there -- I think it's over a longer period of time. But whatever it is, it will be like some money that you get every month based on size of the generation or just a pure way annuity.  Puneet Gulati -- HSBC -- Analyst  OK. So, average tariff to that extent would go up, at least from SECI?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.  Puneet Gulati -- HSBC -- Analyst  OK. My last question is -- and for the new PPAs, you said there is already an enhancement of tariff that will be done. There will be no onetime. It will all -- be all enhancement of tariffs.  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  So in the last few auctions, there is already -- there's already a provision that for every INR 1 lakh increase in the capex per megawatt, there is going to be a INR 0.005 increase in the tariffs. So, all we need to demonstrate them is that this is the amount of money you have spent and there is a tariff. So, there is no formula that the ERC has to determine and get into to rates and this and that and other. It's all defined.  Puneet Gulati -- HSBC -- Analyst  So how does this work? I mean, there will be a percentage impact because of these extra duties. You will have to show what the duty amount that you paid is.  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  That's it. If I was going to pay $100 for a particular -- for a megawatt of module, I have paid $102. That means I have paid $2 more. $2 more is equal to x lakhs is equal to x paisa.  Period.  Puneet Gulati -- HSBC -- Analyst  OK. Great. Great. That's all for me.  Thank you so much. All the best.  Operator  [Operator instructions] The next question is from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.  Pavel Molchanov -- Raymond James -- Analyst  Thanks for taking the question. Two questions for me. The first one, a bit high level. One of the challenges, I know that you are and everybody else is dealing with in India is the unpredictability of lockdown policies from state to state.  So, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra, everybody has their own rules that are changing very frequently. How are you navigating this regulatory complication vis-a-vis your projects, and in some cases, getting our workforce actually to come to work?  Murali Subramanian -- Chief Operating Officer  Can I take that?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Yes.  Murali Subramanian -- Chief Operating Officer  So you're right. There have been differences between the states in terms of how they are imposing the lockdown and what is allowed and what isn't allowed. Having said that, I think over the last couple of weeks, most states have started almost reducing the quarantine days to two or three days, removing the containment zones, reducing them. So, most of the factories have started working.  Now, personnel movement has eased significantly in the last four weeks across the country. There is -- in case of Assam and Bihar, you're right, there is still some problems. But more or less, we haven't been badly affected because most of our projects are in Rajasthan. All the projects under construction are in Rajasthan, and Rajasthan was among the early states to ease the lockdown.  As far as our operating assets go, the people are housed in and around the project itself, so we've not had any trouble over there to operate the projects. In the first two, three weeks, we had trouble moving spares, but that we quickly figured a way around that. And so, we managed to stock up on inventory, etc. So, again, we didn't have too much trouble over there.  So things have sort of limped back the normal -- to some degree of normalcy, I may say, not normal, that would be incorrect. Some degree of normalcy. And we don't -- hopefully, we don't envisage any significant breakdown in the personnel movement or workforce movement of factory production going ahead.  Pavel Molchanov -- Raymond James -- Analyst  OK, that's helpful. Following up --  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Probably that's the reason why we got a five-month extension, right? So there is, in a way that from March 25 when the initial lockdown was imposed till 24th of August, which is next to next week, right? For that period of time, really, if we have done zero work, right, that would have been OK, but of course, we've been working for the last two or three months, not at full pace, but work has been getting done on site. And -- but we get this full five months. Because even beyond lockdown, the government recognized that there were containment zones and there were discrepancies in various states, and they were not fully harmonized and so on. That's why we got this five-month extension.  Pavel Molchanov -- Raymond James -- Analyst  Understood. Following up, can I ask -- is there an update on the sale of the micro-grid business?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Pawan?  Pawan Agrawal -- Chief Financial Officer  Sorry. Hello?  Ranjit Gupta -- Chief Executive Officer  Pavel's question was about the sale of the micro-grid business. An update.  Pawan Agrawal -- Chief Financial Officer  Well, see, very honestly, we haven't told which assets we are looking for sale. But yes, our assets is progressing well. Because of COVID, there have been some delays because of -- because the team wanted to visit site. They needed to conduct their due diligence.  And from our side also, like -- still we don't have any equity needs on an immediate basis. So, we are also taking our own time to get the best deal and then supporting them logistically whatever is needed to be done. So difficult for us to comment on this at this stage. We can only say that we are seeing very good interest and the potential buyers, they are doing their diligence.  Deal process is on, but it's taking some bit of extra time because of COVID situation. So, what all we can comment is that possibly we'll get money well before we need equity, which is quite some time away.  Pavel Molchanov -- Raymond James -- Analyst  Got it.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in March announced incentives that make niche firms — electronics manufacturers — eligible for a payment of 4-6 per cent of their incremental sales over the next five years. The result: about two dozen companies pledged $1.5 billion of investments to set up mobile-phone factories in the country.  Besides Samsung, those that have shown interest are Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, known as Foxconn, Wistron Corp and Pegatron Corp. India has also extended similar incentives to the pharmaceutical sector, and plans to cover more sectors, which may include automobiles, textiles, and food processing under the programme.  While companies have been actively looking to diversify supply chains amid the US-China trade tensions and the coronavirus outbreak, it hasn’t yet translated into big gains for India despite the country making it cheaper for businesses to open shop. Vietnam remains the most favoured destination, followed by Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand, according to a recent survey by Standard Chartered Plc.  There is a reasonable chance for India to gain in terms of incremental investment of supply chains within the country over the medium term, said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Mumbai. These programmes are aimed at increasing India’s manufacturing share in the gross domestic product.  Economic boost  The government expects the programme for electronics alone could lead to $153 billion worth of manufactured goods over the next five years and create about one million jobs directly and indirectly.  This would bring an additional investment of $55 billion over five years, adding 0.5 per cent to India’s economic output, according to analysts led by Neelkanth Mishra at Credit Suisse Group AG. This could shift an additional 10 per cent of global smartphone production to India in five years, most of it from China, they wrote in a report on August 10.  That complements Modi’s goal to grow the share of manufacturing in the economy to 25 per cent from the current around 15 per cent as part of his ‘Make in India’ programme. His government has already lowered taxes on companies to among the lowest in Asia, seeking to attract new investments in an economy headed for its first contraction in more than four decades this year.  The latest output-linked incentive plan is a big win for Make in India, Amish Shah, an analyst at BofA Securities, said in a report to clients. He sees gains for industrials, cement, pharmaceuticals, metals and logistics, with long-term indirect benefits across many sectors."

Claire Wyatt, 24, helped her team cycle from the capital Phnom Penh to Siem Reap to bring food to those who were starving due to the financial ramifications of Covid-19.  Wyatt's team consisted of eight riders with a range of physical disabilities, due to birth defects, illness or accidents such as landmine explosions.  British woman Claire Wyatt, 24, (left) led eight Cambodians living with disabilities in a 250km bike ride  Wyatt, who saw first-hand how the pandemic was leaving hundreds of families desperate, travelled the country with her fellow brave volunteers to supply staple foods such as rice, noodles and canned goods to those in need.  Reflecting on the experience, Wyatt said: 'Leading this trip was an incredibly special experience for me.  'Not just the fact that I was inspired by the determination of each and every rider, but also the team taught me every day not to focus on their disability.'  Wyatt did, however, admit to feeling nervous about leading the group such a vast distance in just four days as there can be both physical and emotional barriers to cycling with a disability.  The riders completed the 250km bike ride in just four days, crossing various terrains. Pictured at the beginning of their quest  Wyatt's team consisted of riders with physical disabilities that included the loss of their limbs. Pictured: a team member  One rider named Dy - who lost an arm in a landmine accident and is a widow with one daughter - was forced to cycle using just one arm to balance his bike.  Other riders such as Vutha - who contracted polio at a very young age which has left him with a paralysed leg - were required to complete the challenge peddling on just one side.  However, it wasn't long before Wyatt realised just how amazing her team was as they crossed various terrains that she had previously seen non-disabled people give up on.  'When I was asked to lead this tour, I was nervous about the immense physical challenge this would be for these inspiring people,' she said.  The 24-year-old cycled the country with other kind volunteers to supply food to starving locals amid the global pandemic  'Many questions popped into my head; will they be able to ride our mountain bikes? Do they need special bikes? How do they change gears?  'For the first ride, I was overly nervous and decided to stick to sealed main roads and only do around 20km.  'Instead, the riders were very confident from the get-go, and we ended up doing 29km and included sections of bumpy tree roots and obstacle jungle trails.  'I have seen fully-abled people give up and walk during these paths, but not one of our riders did.  Wyatt says crossing the finish line is an achievement that will definitely stay with her forever  'Balancing with one arm and going uphill is near impossible, but one of our strongest riders, Naret, showed nothing is impossible.'  Crossing the finish line is an achievement that will stay with Wyatt for the rest of her life as she is proud to have not only supplied food to those in need, but to have helped tackle the emotional barriers for people living with a disability.  She believes the cycling volunteers can take pride in the fact that they are making a real difference to the lives of the local people who would struggle to get by without them.  Wyatt said: 'The best thing about this ride is that the riders have all volunteered their time to do this. They are so passionate about Cambodia and raising money for others in need.  Wyatt is proud have supplied food and help tackle emotional barriers for those living with a disability  'The money raised will feed 99 families for the ongoing future in Siem Reap. Thousands of families are going hungry due to the lack of tourism in Cambodia since Covid-19.'  When asked what her favourite moment of the trip was, Wyatt recalled one of her riders pushing their exhausted team-mate up a hill for 3km.  She said: 'One moment that stood out for me was when Naret, our only female rider, was feeling tired at 70km.  'Her fellow rider gently put his hand on her back and pushed her for 3km! They were constantly encouraging each other to push through the tiredness.'  Wyatt hopes they will be able to make the cycle an annual event with more and more people getting involved each year. Should you wish to donate to the cause, you can contribute here."

India played it by the book, stopped flights from China and Europe and moved swiftly to impose a draconian lockdown on March 25. And, yet, here we are, almost five months later with 2.65 million Covid-19 cases, third behind only the US and Brazil.  To be sure, that’s a smaller percentage of our giga-normous population, but it’s a huge number by any yardstick. What’s more, in the last week we’ve added more cases than both the US and Brazil.  It would be easy to fling blame at the Government. But other countries reacted more tardily and still got away more lightly. Take a look at our neighbours, for instance — but keep in mind the fact their numbers may be kept down because they did much less testing for Covid-19 than we did.  Still, there’s a stark contrast between India and the rest of South and South-East Asia. Just look at Pakistan, which did province-wise lockdowns and then resorted to what it called ‘smart lockdowns’, shutting down only hotspot localities. The World Health Organization (WHO) sternly warned Pakistan about “the hasty lifting of restrictions”. On June 24, Pakistan had 188,926 cases compared to India’s 440,215 cases — which was high considering their population is less than one-sixth of ours. Today, they’ve fallen from a daily tally of over 6,000 cases to 679.  As for Afghanistan, many experts predicted it would be a Covid-19 disaster area because of non-existent healthcare facilities and the fact that many Afghans work in quarries in next-door Iran. When Iran became one of the worst-hit countries after China, most Afghan workers were herded onto crowded buses and pushed back across the border. So far, it claims to have only 37,676 cases and 1,377 deaths.  Inevitably, experts say the Afghan figures must be hugely under-reported, but the catastrophe forecast doesn’t appear to have occurred.  It’s the same pattern in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and even Myanmar with which we share a 1,643-km border. Bangladesh got its first Covid-19 cases in April and they peaked in June at slightly over 4,000 a day. The numbers have fallen steadily since then and were at 2,024 on August 14. The catch with Bangladesh’s figures is the country has the lowest test/positive cases ratio in the region so they may be woefully under-counting numbers.  As for Myanmar, it hass recorded only 375 cases and six deaths. Of these, 69 returned from India and the country and it says it had its first locally transmitted case a few days ago.  Myanmar may be helped by the fact it’s one of the world’s Hermit Kingdoms, at the tail-end of globalisation and still gets few foreign tourists.  Similar trend  It’s much the same story across Asia. Take Thailand, one of the world’s great tourism destinations. Back in 2010, the Thais had about 15.94 million tourists annually. That zoomed to 29 million by 2019. Where were the new tourist hordes coming from? No prizes awarded for getting that answer right. In 2019, 11 million Chinese tourists headed to Thailand’s beaches and green and pleasant land.  So, it wasn’t a surprise when Thailand was the first country to have a confirmed case of Covid-19 cases after China. By March 22, the Thais were shooting ahead of their neighbours with 188 cases. But, then, the infection vanished as suddenly as it arrived and after April 25 the Thais have reported less than 20 cases daily.  The New York Times reports that other Mekong Delta countries, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, have also had low case numbers, as has Yunnan, the Chinese province next door to these countries.  One explanation offered by Thai doctors is there’s no resistance to wearing masks and the country doesn’t have a Western-style touchy-feely culture and they do what’s called the Wai, very much like the namaste.  The obvious point here is doing the namaste hasn’t helped India keep down Covid-19 cases. Is there a genetic reason? Thai doctors are looking into this but they aren’t anywhere near an answer.  Across Asia, Covid-19 fatality figures have been lower than in Europe and the US and the only plausible reason doctors offer is Asians are attacked by all kinds of infectious diseases like dengue and this could have left us all with better Covid-19 immune responses.  There could be one reason for India’s zooming numbers. That’s the migrant crisis which had people travelling hundreds of miles, some in crowded lorries and other conditions where social distancing wasn’t possible. But in Bangladesh, too, large numbers returned to their villages when they lost jobs in urban areas.  What could the future hold for India? One prediction is we’re heading towards becoming the global Covid-19 hotspot — though the US with 5.41 million cases and 171,000 deaths is still far out in front. But we’ve just crossed the 50,000 cases a day mark and that should be raising alarm bells everywhere.  Is there good news amidst this gloom? A survey conducted between July 20 and August 5 in five sub-wards or prabhags in Pune indicates an average of 51.5 per cent sero prevalence in these areas. The sero prevalence was higher in areas with hutments and tenements than in places with larger apartments or houses.  A similar study in Mumbai’s Dharavi district found 57 per cent of people there had antibodies against the infection.  This could indicate achieving “herd immunity” — when the virus peters out because there are no longer enough susceptible hosts — is closer than we think. (The rider to that is it’s still not known whether antibody prevalence confers immunity against subsequent infection, doctors say.)  Dark matter  Alternatively, there’s the theory of what virologists call ‘dark matter’. This simply means that many people in any given country have built-in immunity to Covid-19 or other illnesses and aren’t likely to ever contract them.  Going by this theory, it could be that herd immunity can be reached after 20-25 per cent of the population has been exposed to the illness. Look at it this way and herd immunity becomes a much less daunting target.  Fortunately for us, we now live in the Big Data era. That has enabled us to work towards a vaccine at a speed that would have been impossible even a decade ago. Indian doctors are swapping data and information with their counterparts in places like Lombardy, Italy, and New York that were struck savagely by the pandemic.

The Umno deputy president said this was needed to promote private sector investment as the government continues to work on measures to strengthen the economy which shrank 17.1% in the second quarter of 2020.  ""The current investment sentiment is weak and this will not help promote business growth nor create new jobs.  ""In fact, the government should also consider giving a reasonable one-off tax exemption to individuals in the middle- and lower-income categories who have been badly affected by the pandemic,"" he said in a statement Tuesday (Aug 18).  Mohamad said authorities should also consider introducing a wealth and inheritance tax to help make up for the shortfall in tax collection.  A wealth tax is a levy on the total value of personal assets, including bank deposits and real estate and an inheritance tax is paid by those who inherits money or property.  Mohamad said the government should also consider reopening its borders in stages.  ""Reopening our borders will certainly be a catalyst for economic activities, allow easier movement of labour and address unemployment.  ""Domestic tourism and the higher education sectors cannot survive purely on support from the local market,"" he said, adding that reopening borders with selected nations will help facilitate trade.  Mohamad said Asean member countries should also work towards strengthening cooperation.  ""Asean has to stimulate the regional economy by reducing trade barriers imposed during the outbreak and work towards finalising the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP),"" he said.  The RCEP, initiated by Asean in 2012, is a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) between its 10 member states, namely Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and their six Asean-FTA partners – China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India.  Mohamad said although the economic contraction in the second quarter was the worst since 1998, there were already signs that the economy has been slowly improving since May.

India's latest set of incentives to entice businesses moving away from China seem to be working, with companies from Samsung Electronics Co to Apple Inc's assembly partners showing interest in investing in the country.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in March announced incentives that make niche firms -- electronics manufacturers -- eligible for a payment of 4%-6% of their incremental sales over the next five years. The result: about two dozen companies pledged $1.5 billion of investments to set up mobile-phone factories in the country.  Besides Samsung, those that have shown interest are Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, known as Foxconn, Wistron Corp and Pegatron Corp. India has also extended similar incentives to pharmaceutical businesses, and plans to cover more sectors, which may include automobiles, textiles, and food processing under the program.  While companies have been actively looking to diversify supply chains amid the US-China trade tensions and the coronavirus outbreak, it hasn't yet translated into big gains for India despite the nation making it cheaper for businesses to open shop. Vietnam remains the most favored destination, followed by Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand, according to a recent survey by Standard Chartered Plc.  ""There is a reasonable chance for India to gain in terms of incremental investment of supply chains within the country over the medium term,"" said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Mumbai. ""These programs are aimed at increasing India's manufacturing share in the gross domestic product.""  Economic Boost  Samsung plans to make $40 billion worth of smartphones in India and may shift a major part of its production from Vietnam and other countries, the Economic Times reported, citing people it didn't identify. Samsung didn't respond to queries from the newspaper.  The incentives would help bring an additional investment of $55 billion over five years, adding 0.5% to economic output, according to analysts led by Neelkanth Mishra at Credit Suisse Group AG. This could shift an additional 10% of global smart-phone production to India in five years, most of it from China, they wrote in a report on August 10.  That complements PM Modi's goal to grow the share of manufacturing in the economy to 25% from the current around 15% as part of his 'Make in India' program. The government has already lowered taxes on companies to among the lowest in Asia, seeking to attract new investments in an economy headed for its first contraction in more than four decades this year.  The latest output-linked incentive plan is a ""big win for Make in India,"" Amish Shah, an analyst at BofA Securities, said in a report to clients. He sees gains for industrials, cement, pharmaceuticals, metals and logistics, with long-term indirect benefits across many sectors.

Assembly partners of giant players in the electronics segment such as Samsung and Apple have shown interest in moving to India. These companies have pledged investments to the tune of $1.5 billion so as to establish mobile-phone factories, Bloomberg reported.  The companies are planning to diversify supply chains amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and US-China trade war. So far, India has lagged behind countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand in enticing these companies to set up plants in the country. However, the Indian government expects that the PLI could lead to production of $153 billion of manufactured goods and generation of nearly 1 million direct and indirect jobs.  In March this year, the government had announced a production linked incentive scheme (PLI) for large scale electronics manufacturing to boost domestic manufacturing and attract large investments in mobile phone manufacturing and specified electronic components. The scheme extended an incentive of 4 per cent to 6 per cent on incremental sales (over base year) of goods manufactured in India and covered under target segments, to eligible companies, for a period of five years subsequent to the base year as defined. Later such incentives were also extended to other sectors including pharma, auto, textiles, and food processing under the program.  According to recent reports, Apple has plans to expand manufacturing in India. Its supplier Foxconn is also planning to invest up to $1 billion in India. Foxconn's planned investment in the plant near Chennai would take place over the course of three years.

Now, governments are adding restrictions that range from outright tourist bans to increased testing and quarantine requirements, while other islands are indefinitely postponing plans to reopen.  U.S. Virgin Islands bans tourists for one month  As of Wednesday, hotels, villas, Airbnbs, charter vessels and ""similar businesses"" in the U.S. Virgin Islands cannot accept new guests or make reservations from leisure travelers for a period of 30 days. For those there, the island atmosphere is about to change. All nonessential businesses, including bars and nightclubs, have been ordered to close, and restaurants cannot offer dine-in services. Weekend beach access has been restricted.  New rules follow the U.S. Virgin Islands return to ""stay at home"" status, the country's fourth (out of five) most restrictive reopening phase. M Swiet Productions | Moment | Getty Images  ""When we announced our Covid-19 alert system in May, I indicated at that time that we would retreat back to a more cautious state of alert if conditions warranted,"" Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. said during a press conference on Aug. 13. ""Unfortunately, we have arrived at that point this week."" Overall numbers remain low, but Covid-19 infections in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which includes St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix, have doubled since last month. Total cases: 760  Bahamas welcomed, then banned, then re-welcomed travelers  The Bahamas had been open to tourists less than three weeks when 49 new cases of Covid-19 prompted Prime Minister Hubert Minnis to announce that only travelers from Canada, the U.K. and the EU could enter. The decision mostly affected Americans, who had made up more than 78% of the islands' stopover visitors as of 2016. The restriction lasted mere days, however, as the country announced on July 24 it was reversing its decision in favor of updated requirements and a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all visitors. The government also imposed a weekend lockdown from July 22 to 24. At that time, the Bahamas had 274 Covid-19 cases. Total cases: 1,329  Cayman Islands extends its border closure  On Aug. 7, the Cayman Islands announced its borders will stay closed until at least Oct. 1. The decision was based on the rate of infection in other countries — particularly the United States — according to a press statement from the country. Total cases: 203  Visitors, who travel to the Cayman Islands for the beaches and scuba sites, won't be able to go this summer. EXTREME-PHOTOGRAPHER | E+ | Getty Images  Other Caribbean and Atlantic islands: Antigua, Bermuda and St. Lucia reopened this summer and have kept new infections relatively low. Jamaica is stable, though an upward trend in new cases is emerging. Others have not been so lucky. Puerto Rico, Aruba and Turks and Caicos experienced a rapid increase in new infections in August, resulting in Aruba and Turks and Caicos being removed from the U.K.'s travel corridors list.  Bali's reopening is iffy  Except Cambodia, Southeast Asia is closed to international travelers, so the region has kept close tabs on Indonesia's plans to reopen Bali to foreign tourists on Sept. 11. Those plans now appear tentative at best. Last week, Indonesian Minister Erick Thohir, who oversees the country's coronavirus task force, said that due to concerns over new outbreaks, the reopening schedule is under review.  The popular town of Ubud (shown here) and the rest of Bali opened to domestic tourists on July 31. Francisco Goncalves | Moment | Getty Images  Bali opened to domestic travelers on July 31. At that time, the island had around 3,300 total cases. As of Aug. 15, 724 more cases have been confirmed. After the Philippines, Indonesia has the second highest number of Covid-19 cases in Southeast Asia. Total cases: 4,024 (as of Aug. 15)  French Polynesia is open — but there's a catch  While French Polynesia remains open to tourists, the country is experiencing a spike of Covid-19 cases. After the South Pacific islands reported just two cases in all of June and July, French Polynesia has confirmed 104 cases in the past two weeks. The country has been open for just over a month; it reopened to tourists (and abolished quarantine requirements) on July 15. Cases have been confirmed in Tahiti, Mo'orea, Bora Bora and Rangiora, despite requirements that travelers produce negative polymerase chain reaction Covid-19 tests before arriving. From Aug. 12 to 25, nightclubs must remain closed, and masks are required in restaurants, bars, shops and other public areas. Total cases: 211  The Maldives is surging  More than 3,000 foreign tourists, mainly from the U.K. and the U.S., visited the Maldives since it reopened on July 15. Unfortunately, the country experienced a surge in coronavirus cases several weeks later. The island nation has had 1,730 new cases since the start of August, which means around 30% of its total cases stem from the past two weeks alone. The first confirmed Covid-19 case in the country was on March 7. Total cases: 5,909  Hawaii's reopening is likely delayed  Hawaii was on schedule to reopen on Sept. 1 until the island of Oahu experienced a spike in new cases this month. The state's reopening had already been postponed from Aug. 1, due to an increase in cases in the continental U.S.  A rise in cases on the island of Oahu is threatening to derail Hawaii's Sept. 1 reopening plans.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said last Wednesday that the next 10 days would be ""critical"" in a country that has been widely praised for its earlier containment success.  The new outbreak began on July 25 in Danang, raising fears that tourism and many other activities could take a severe hit just as the economy was developing momentum.  But it is not all the bad news for Vietnam, which is one of the few countries forecast to register gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year. That will depend partly on a revival of global trade, but it is well positioned.  For a start, a new free-trade agreement with the European Union (EU) came into force this month and is expected to provide a much needed post-pandemic boost.  The European Union-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA), according to Reuters, will eliminate 99% of tariffs on goods traded between the two, giving Vietnam's exporters an access to an US$18-trillion market.  The Hanoi government forecasts exports to the EU will grow by 42.7% over the next five years. The World Bank says the deal has the potential to lift Vietnam's GDP by 2.4% and its total exports by 12% by 2030.  Vietnam already enjoys preferential tariffs in the EU under the Generalized Scheme of Preferences (GSP). The EU is one of the largest foreign investors in Vietnam, accounting for about half of the country's total foreign direct investment (FDI).  Among the major beneficiaries of the pact will be garments, which make up about 10% of the country's exports. The EU is Vietnam's second largest garment market after the United States, accounting for 15% of the country's total garment exports last year. Backed by more than a dozen FTAs, Vietnam has emerged as a key link in the global manufacturing supply chain.  The EVFTA is the second FTA between the EU and an Asean country, after Singapore. As a region, Southeast Asia is the EU's third-largest international trading partner, after the US and China. With cumulative FDI of $374 billion in Asean by the end of 2017, the EU has expressed a desire to pursue an FTA with Asean as a whole, but little progress has been made. Negotiations began in 2007 but ended in 2009 when individual countries started to push for bilateral talks.  On one hand, the EU pacts with Vietnam and Singapore could disadvantage other Asean countries if the EU increases its investment in Singapore and Vietnam in sectors like the automotive industry, in which Thailand is the regional leader.  However, the EVFTA illustrates that the EU sees growing opportunities in Southeast Asia, and the pact has the potential to be a catalyst for fresh EU-Asean talks.  The garment industry, meanwhile, has a highly integrated regional supply chain, and growing exports of clothing labelled ""Made in Vietnam"" could also benefit related factories in Cambodia, where the garment industry is one of the few job creators, and Bangladesh -- the world's second-largest apparel exporter after China.  Asia is still the single largest apparel sourcing base for Western fashion brands. They have diversified sourcing away from China, but their orders have largely been filled by other Asian countries -- mainly to the benefit of Bangladesh, Vietnam and elsewhere in Asean.  Besides garments, Vietnam also benefits from China-plus-one strategies as rising wages on the mainland and US-China tensions accelerate a trend toward relocation. Multinationals including Apple, Samsung and Nintendo have moved some capacity from China to Vietnam. Major export clusters for electronic equipment and textiles have emerged in Vietnam to attract global manufacturers, and industrial zones are booming.  Nonetheless, Vietnam's major challenges lie in port and transport infrastructure that are still less developed than regional peers, while stable electricity supply is a recurrent problem. Also, highly skilled workers are in short supply, though this provides opportunities for higher-skilled personnel from neighbouring countries including Thailand to help Vietnamese industries move up the global value chain.  As the post-pandemic economy takes shape, some countries in Southeast Asia could emerge from the crisis faster and with better opportunities than others.  But as we look forward to the reopening of economies and borders, interdependency among Asean members will be even more important, and progress toward deeper integration should be a priority. Looking beyond the challenges we are facing, how Asean responds collectively will help each country and the region as a whole. We should survive stronger together, shouldn't we?"

I hate watching a movie with someone and the other person goes, “that would never happen.” It’s like, no shit. You’re gonna have to let some of them slide.  Here’s a list of 40 movie plot holes that I’ll be sending to every person that’s ever ruined a movie for me.  1. Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban (2004)  “The way the Marauders’ Map works…wouldn’t Fred and George have SEEN Peter Pettigrew sleeping in bed with Ron every night on the map?”  2. Armageddon (1998)  “I like to imagine there was a conversation behind the scenes like this: Ben Affleck: ‘Wouldn’t it be easier to train astronauts to be drillers than it would be to train oil drillers to be astronauts?’ Michael Bay: ‘Shut the [hell] up.'”  3. Hercules (1997)  “Hades (James Woods), king of the underworld, wants Hercules (Tate Donovan) dead. He puts his best henchmen, Pain and Panic (Bobcat Goldthwait and Matt Frewer), on the job. They tell him he’s dead. And Hades believes them, for quite some time! But, as we know, they’re dead wrong. Hercules may be super strong. But Hades is, without exaggeration, the king of the underworld. Why didn’t he double-check that Hercules was actually dead? Just by, like, looking around? He lives and works in the place where dead people go. Wouldn’t Hercules have shown up?”  4. Every Single Christmas Movie  “In literally every single Christmas movie, none of the parents believe in Santa, yet every year there are several unexpected presents under the tree and no one questions it.”  5. Tangled (2010)  “In Tangled, everything revolved around Rapunzel seeing the lights on her birthday, but Mother Gothel could have just lied about which day she was born.”  6. Signs (2002)  “Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix find out that water is toxic to the aliens…yet the aliens have been fine walking around with all the natural humidity in the air on a planet made up of MOSTLY water.”  7. The Little Mermaid (1989)  “She wants to be where the people are. So Ariel, The Little Mermaid herself, makes a deal to gain legs and lose her voice, just so she can go above the sea and fall in love with Prince Eric. Complications, often involving charades, ensue. But why didn’t she write on a piece of paper to Eric about what was going on? After all, we see her write in English earlier when she signs her name for the deal. Fans asked animators this question at an event. The animators just smiled and said, “Next question.”  8. Independence Day (1996)  “Oh, this human-made computer virus magically works on their alien technology, too, because that’s how computers work.”  9. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)  “The kind of plot hole that gives directors and scriptwriters nightmares can be found in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – Angelina Jolie’s fun but flawed video game adaptation from 2001. The film focuses on Lara Croft’s mission to protect the world from the Illuminati, who are planning to use an artifact called the Triangle during a solar eclipse to inflict devastation on the world – a peak 00s plot if ever we’ve heard one. We learn that the Triangle is split into two parts, and after acquiring the first of them in Cambodia, Croft sets off on another perilous journey to retrieve the second in Siberia. The problem is, we already know the Triangle can’t work without both halves, so all Croft had to do was destroy the half she already had in her possession and the job would be done.”  10. A Quiet Place (2018)  “In A Quiet Place, instead of making shelter near the waterfall (i.e. the only place where the killer monsters couldn’t hear them), they lived on a noisy farm.”  11. Monsters University (2013)  “In Monsters University, Mike and Sully didn’t meet until their first year of college, but in Monster’s, Inc. they claimed to be friends since elementary school.”  12. Toy Story (1995)  “In Toy Story, if Buzz was so convinced he was a real space ranger, why did he adhere to all of the standard toy rules, like “playing dead” when a person was in the room?”  13. Back To The Future (1985)  “How did Marty’s dad not recognize that his son grew up to be the person that helped him get the girl he wanted? Like, he didn’t even think he looked remotely familiar later in life.”  14. Star Wars Series  “In the Star Wars series, the lack of air and differences in gravitational pull should have affected everyone on each new planet, especially since they’re different sizes and don’t have the same atmospheric pressures.”  15. Ant-Man (2015)  “The MCU got a fun jolt of unorthodox humor with 2015’s Ant-Man, starring Paul Rudd. Rudd’s superhero can shrink down to the size of an ant and back. But there’s a rule that he’s told often: His mass doesn’t change. He weighs the same tiny as he did normal. If taken seriously, this would render essential moments, like ants picking a tiny Ant-Man up, impossible. It would also mean he couldn’t sneak around vents — his weight would collapse them instantly. And in Captain America: Civil War, his growing bigger wouldn’t give him super strength.”  16. National Treasure (2004)  “We know — most of the Nicolas Cage adventure flick is renowned for its calm, patient accuracy. But there’s something seriously off about the famous moment when Cage’s Benjamin Franklin Gates steals the Declaration of Independence. Other than the sheer lunacy of those words put together in that order. When Ben reads the Declaration later, we see it starts with “We the people”. But that’s the opening to the Constitution, not the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration begins with “When in the course of human events”. Either Ben made a serious miscalculation, or that’s a huge filmmaking error!”  17. Home Alone (1990)  “In Home Alone, Kevin’s mom wasn’t able to call him from Paris because the phone lines were down, yet Kevin was somehow able to call and order himself a pizza.”  18. Gremlins (1984)  “Gremlins has three rules for dealing with the title creatures: Don’t put them in sunlight. Don’t put them in water. And don’t feed them after midnight. If you do any of these, you’ll risk turning the cuties into destructive, bloodthirsty creatures. Simple enough, right? Let’s look closer… “Don’t feed them after midnight.” Technically speaking, it’s… always after midnight. And, simultaneously, before midnight. 12:01 am is both one minute after midnight and 23 hours and 59 minutes before the next midnight. Is midnight the only time you’re allowed to feed them? Our brain hurts!”  19. Men In Black (1997)  “In Men in Black, Earth was literally going to be blown up in an hour, but only two agents (one of whom was a newbie) were sent to save the world.”  20. Beauty And The Beast (1991)  “In Beauty and the Beast, the Beast was actually a prince, which meant he would have been highly educated, so why did Belle have to teach him how to read?”  21. Gravity (2013)  “In Gravity, Matt was floating away and ordered Ryan to let go of the tethered rope, but since there’s no gravity in space all Ryan had to do was gently pull the rope toward her to bring Matt back.”  22. X-Men III: Wolverine (2006)  “In X-Men: The Last Stand’s finale, Phoenix Jean Grey is literally tearing reality apart and ripping people into nothingness. Wolverine battles his way to his unrequited love, skin ripping from his adamantium frame. His life is being destroyed. But, weirdly, not his pants. They seem to be made from something even stronger than adamantium. No peek of a Wolver-willy for us then.”  23. Limitless (2011)  “In Limitless, Bradley Cooper becomes the world’s smartest man thanks to a new wonder drug. It’s actually quite an enjoyable and entertaining film (until the silly ending). However, it’s let down by one of those plot contrivances that once read, destroys the film. If he’s so smart, why does he think it’s a good idea to borrow money from a mobster? I’m an idiot and I know not to do that.”  24. Ant-Man (2015)  “In Ant-Man and the Wasp, no one noticed Hank’s giant lab that would mysteriously appear and then disappear at random parts of the city, even though he was trying to be discreet while hiding from the FBI.”  25. Avengers: Endgame (2019)  “In Avengers: Endgame, Captain America traveled back in time to return the Infinity Stones, which would have changed the current timeline, yet he somehow managed to reappear in the present to give Falcon his shield. Captain America reappearing in the same timeline he left goes against all of the time travel rules Bruce Banner originally laid out.

Earlier in the film, it’s said that “hits to the face” are not permitted, not specifying whether that includes kicks. Macchio himself called the crane kick a clear violation, and the later YouTube series Cobra Kai features its alleged legitimacy as a prominent plot point.”  37. Return Of The Jedi (1983)  “We all love Ewoks (we do), but even as a child, I was a bit incredulous that the cute little bears could defeat an entire legion of the Emperor’s best troops. It wasn’t their ingenuity or fighting skills I doubted though, it was the fact that sticks and stones could apparently pierce armor. It must have been made of paper they way some of them go down. Obviously, the Empire is an expensive thing to run, especially when you’ve got a penchant for building moon-sized super-weapons with a limited shelf-life, but you’d hope that your best soldiers could get some decent blast armor…”  38. 28 Weeks Later (2007)  “Really? No one was guarding the wife who had just been rescued from the infected zone? They were wary of her enough to strap her down, but not enough to order a guard to watch her even though they did so for the two kids? Right.”  39.

Now she believes it could have saved her life.  At just 25 years old, she was young, fit and – she believed – in perfect health when she collapsed at her home in Essex in May.  “I’ve always been into exercise as a way to keep fit and in shape,” says Loren, who worked as a teaching assistant before her travels.  ”I was cooling down after doing my usual routine when I felt a sudden pain in my neck. It was very odd – like a big click inside my body.  “My first thought was that I’d pulled a muscle, so I went to sit down. But a couple of minutes later, my boyfriend said I was looking a bit odd and passed me a glass of water.  “Next thing, I collapsed. I was unconscious for 10 minutes – and when I started to come round, I couldn’t see.”  What Loren thought was a muscle strain was in fact a stroke in the basilar artery of her brain – one of the most potentially devastating types of stroke, fatal in as many as 85% of cases.  For those who survive, these strokes can leave patients with severe disabilities, including head-to-toe paralysis or locked-in syndrome.  Yet miraculously, thanks to prompt and expert treatment, Loren is one of the lucky few who escape completely unscathed.  Now she believes she’s alive and well because the coronavirus outbreak forced her to curtail her travels.  She was in Thailand, half-way through a two-year trip around the world with her boyfriend Harry Rodell, also 25, when the pandemic struck, forcing the couple to return to the UK.  They went into lockdown with Loren’s family in Chadwell St Mary, Essex and were there when Loren collapsed on May 18.  “The paramedics told me that I’d probably had a stroke,” she says. “I thought that sounded pretty crazy, given my age and good health. I thought strokes were something that only happened to old people.”  While most strokes do occur in people aged over 55, the Stroke Association points out that they can happen at any age, even in babies.  Loren was rushed to her nearest hospital in Basildon, where she was treated with clot-busting drugs, then transferred to Queen’s Hospital, Romford, where she underwent a throm-bectomy.  The procedure has to be carried out within hours of the stroke and involves inserting a small mesh hook into an artery in the groin, moving it up to the brain and pulling out the blood clot.  It only works in a small proportion of stroke cases, but can have a big impact on reducing disability.  As a fairly new “game-changing” procedure, it is currently not widely available. Had Loren not been in the UK when she had her stroke, it’s unlikely she would have been able to have the treatment.  “The date I had my stroke, I should have been in Cambodia,” says Loren. “There, I wouldn’t have had speedy access to the amazing medical care that we tend to take for granted in this country.”  After four days, she went home from hospital, but the following day a scan showed a Deep Vein Thrombosis in her right leg. She was re-admitted for 10 days of treatment with blood-thinning drugs, which she will take for at least six months.  Remarkably, now her life has almost returned to normal.  “Strokes like mine can kill or leave their victims with a lifetime of disability, but I’ve survived unscathed,” says Loren. “I feel so thankful that I’ve suffered no permanent ill effects. I’ve even been told I can go travelling again if I want to.”  Understandably, however, she has been left wanting answers. “I’ve had lots of tests to figure out what caused the blood clot which led to my stroke,” she says. “So far, there is no clear reason why it happened.  “Doctors say it’s possible the combined contraceptive pill I was taking could be a contributory factor. I have now stopped taking it.”  Whatever caused her stroke, one thing Loren is certain about, is that its striking when she was in the UK, rather than away travelling as planned, made the difference between life and death or decades of disability.  “I want to thank our wonderful NHS – and Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust in particular. They – and coronavirus – saved my life.”"

The group cited its latest finding that many communities have already prepared property for the venture and are pinning hopes on the programme as a way to relieve hardship during the pandemic.  Some villages in the Northeast have shifted to growing napier grass for biomass-fuelled power plants in a bid to raise money for their irrigation development projects, the association said.  The scheme allows registered communities, known as community enterprises, to co-invest with private investors to operate power plants fuelled by clean energy.  ""Many farmers in remote areas want to earn extra revenue, as they cannot depend solely on agricultural prices,"" said WETA adviser Pichai Tinsuntisook.  When the coronavirus outbreak hit Thailand earlier this year, leading to lockdown measures nationwide, many farmers in far-flung provinces went bankrupt. They view napier grass planting as a way out.  Mr Pichai said Energy for All is also favoured by politicians because it can boost their popularity among rural voters.  In his view, the scheme may have been a factor behind pressure on economic ministers, including former energy minister Sontirat Sontijirawong, to resign so that rival politicians could oversee the scheme themselves.  Under the scheme, up to 1,000 megawatts of electricity is to be produced over the next three years. But in the first year, it will be carried out through the Quick Win concept, with capacity of 100MW.  Quick Win is aimed at inviting power plants currently under construction or those yet to begin commercial operation to join the scheme.  For low-income people, Energy for All is crucial to improving their quality of life and different from the call for charter amendment by student-led protesters, Mr Pichai said.  Earlier, Energy Policy and Planning Office chief Wattanapong Kurovat said he would ask new Energy Minister Supattanapong Punmeechaow to solve the huge surplus of energy generation capacity reserved, now more than 40% of total capacity, by selling some to neighbouring countries like Myanmar and Cambodia.  Amorn Sapthaweekul, deputy chief of Energy Absolute Plc, suggested the government reduce the surplus by developing fast charging outlets for electric vehicles, which require much more electricity than ordinary charging facilities.  Power capacity, connected to the state grid, currently stands at 50,327MW. Peak demand for electricity was only 30,340MW in March during the lockdown, lower than 32,000MW during the peak period in May last year.  Praipol Koomsup, a Thammasat University economist and adviser to the former energy minister, also urged authorities to revise the 2018 national power development plan (PDP 2018).  The plan was designed before the pandemic, so the government must change it to make energy policies correspond with economic situations caused by the global infections, he said."

Somewhat ironically, China has emerged as an attractive model for flattening the infection curve, despite the virus originating from within its borders. Beijing’s public health response—defined by the stewardship of advanced digital technologies to control and monitor the virus’s spread—has drawn international praise from leading health officials for its effectiveness in containing the outbreak. With limited alternatives from Western countries, global leaders have increasingly looked to China for technical guidance and material support, and Beijing has eagerly provided its assistance.  While China’s surveillance technologies have long been sought after by authoritarian regimes seeking to shore up domestic control, the pandemic has expanded their appeal in the international marketplace. China’s effective response to Covid-19 has amplified global demand for its digital public health toolset, providing a new inroad for its government and technology companies to deepen their international footprint. The resulting proliferation of Chinese surveillance technologies and data collection platforms, under the cover of anti-epidemic cooperation, may be providing China an opportunity to further promote its model of digital governance. Global debates over the norms and standards that govern acceptable use of digital tools by central governments around the world are far from settled, and this new environment risks tilting the balance away from democratic values in the digital world.  How Covid-19 Attracts Chinese Tech  China’s use of technological tools, from artificial intelligence (AI)-powered public security platforms to cloud-linked medical software, has been integral to its coronavirus response. The Chinese government rapidly mobilized a vast array of surveillance tools, ranging from dense networks of security cameras, advanced facial recognition software, location-tracking apps, and even talking police drones. A smartphone app, piloted in Hangzhou but quickly spreading throughout the country, was developed to track citizens’ history and health conditions, rating their risk for carrying the virus and assigning a correspondingly colored QR code.  China has now largely contained the virus, but there is growing concern that the enhanced surveillance systems it has put in place are becoming permanent. Hangzhou’s Communist Party secretary suggested the city’s health monitoring app should become part of daily life and “loved so much that you cannot bear to part with it.” Although some citizens have demanded the government delete personal health data after the crisis has passed, authorities have put forward no formal plans or mechanisms to ensure those demands will be met.  Having declared victory over the outbreak at home, Beijing is now exporting its anti-epidemic tools and practices to countries around the world—often building upon pre-existing partnerships. In Ecuador, Chinese technology systems, including a Huawei-built AI-powered diagnostic system and a comprehensive public security platform designed by Chinese engineers, have become strategic tools for central authorities in their fight against Covid-19. The Chinese-built security system, called ECU 911, provides police services access to GPS data integrated with feeds from over 5,800 video surveillance cameras blanketing the country. Since the crisis, ECU 911 has reportedly assumed “new responsibilities” to help the country move towards what authorities there are openly calling the “new normal.”  Huawei has also used the outbreak to pitch its services to the Indian government. The company offered Indian authorities 5G thermal imaging software to help them “apply [Huawei’s] learnings and experience from China to the current situation in India.” In an unusually transparent statement illustrating the company’s broader objectives, Huawei India CEO Jay Chen suggested “the success of 5G applications in the public health domain could also inspire businesses in other sectors to leverage 5G's popularity and explore new applications of the technology.”  Even where Chinese-built technology has not been actively utilized, countries have emulated Beijing’s anti-epidemic measures. The success that early adopters of smartphone-based epidemiology had against the virus—namely China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore—encouraged a rapid and widespread global diffusion of centralized contact tracing apps. Yet in many countries, these technologies were hurriedly adopted without corresponding assurances of user protection. As of mid-June 2020, at least 47 such apps were active in 28 countries, of which nearly a quarter had no privacy agreement and over half had no clear measures to ensure anonymity.  In the face of the virus’s mounting toll, calls to put aside privacy concerns in favor of public health have gained ground even in major democracies such as the United Kingdom and the United States. In the United Kingdom, top health experts nearly succeeded in pushing the government to implement a centralized contact tracing app, more akin to the central data-aggregation design of Chinese systems than the decentralized privacy-oriented versions now being implemented in select U.S. cities. Yet across the United States, location-tracking tech firms once scorned by public officials are now being utilized by state and local authorities to monitor hotspots as economic reopening gets underway.  Empowering Authoritarian Governance  While China’s anti-epidemic technologies may be helping some countries curb the immediate threat of the virus, they also carry an inherent risk of co-optation by authoritarian regimes seeking to consolidate authority. As China’s sophisticated public surveillance platforms—enhanced with AI technology, location-tracking software, and personal data integration techniques—diffuse around the globe, recipient governments gain access to a readily-used authoritarian toolkit that can be easily retooled from its original public health purpose. This technology poses a particular risk to fragile democracies and countries in the developing world, where civil society is weak but Chinese influence is growing.  Recent events have demonstrated that this co-optation risk is not limited to authoritarian regimes. U.S. analysts need not look far for cautionary tales. In the United States, as demonstrations swept through some of Minnesota’s largest cities as a result of the police killing of George Floyd, state law enforcement officials openly refashioned the epidemiological paradigm of “contact tracing” to track the origins of protestors.  It should be noted that, on its own, the use of advanced technologies in public health does not pose an inherent threat to democratic governance. Ultimately, the actors leveraging the technology are the ones who determine how it will be used. Yet in countries without robust democratic institutions that provide checks on authority, the risk of misuse is elevated. Even South Korea, a strong democracy whose Covid-19 response has been hailed as a model of digital public health, was shown to have failed to adequately protect the personal data of thousands of people using its mandatory quarantine app. Public blowback forced accountable elected officials there to address the app’s vulnerabilities, but in countries without institutional balances or open civic discourse, such oversights likely go systematically unchecked.  Beyond easing and encouraging authoritarian inclinations worldwide, the spread of China’s technology-focused Covid-19 response has accelerated the normative challenge that China’s governance model poses to the underlying values of today’s liberal international order. As China’s surveillance technologies and data-collection protocols prove effective at stemming the spread of disease, their broader application may gain global legitimacy. This will boost an ongoing effort by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to shift prevailing global narratives on governance away from a preference for liberal democracy toward an international order that is friendly to autocracy. The CCP has and needs no better narrative instrument than a highly visible demonstration of its model’s success, particularly when compared to the foundering responses of many Western democracies.  Technology’s central role in this defining narrative moment for China cannot be overlooked. In the United States and many European countries, where privacy protections are strictest and public appetite for widespread surveillance is minimal, authorities were slow to harness technology to limit the virus’s spread. Although factors beyond the underuse of technological tools were undoubtedly at play in those countries, their comparative failure to curb the virus nonetheless only boosts the attractiveness of China’s tech-focused model, where civic and digital freedoms are readily sacrificed for the “greater good” of public health.  Setting Standards for the “New Normal”  Recognizing an opportunity to further consolidate global leadership, Beijing has actively used health cooperation to promote a “global community of health for all,” with China at the center. Despite resolutely denying any intention of exporting a Chinese Covid-19 response model, leaders in Beijing have encouraged the narrative that China’s health response is one to be praised and replicated by the international community. In conversations with world leaders, Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly invoked the concept of a “Health Silk Road,” seeking to revive a Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)-linked project aimed at promoting global health cooperation centered around Beijing’s high-tech framework. By the end of May, China had sent medical teams to at least 27 countries, focusing largely on its strategic BRI partners in the developing world such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Laos, Cambodia, the Philippines, and countries across Africa.  CCP leaders have also called for China to seize the opportunity presented by Covid-19 to advance a sweeping strategy to set the global standards for next-generation technologies. The plan, called China Standards 2035, seeks to internationalize Beijing’s preferred standards for emerging tech like AI, blockchain, and 5G. Government documents show the Covid-19 crisis is set to play a major role. A work report released by China’s National Standardization Committee in early March calls for China to “strengthen the construction of the relevant standard system for the prevention and control of Covid-19,” and promote its “standards for emergency response, social prevention and control.” If China’s domestically cultivated digital governance toolset continues to gain global popularity and legitimacy through the pandemic’s spread, Western governments and companies will face an uphill battle competing against China’s standards-setting agenda.  As the world limps toward recovery, observers should carefully watch the continued spread of China’s anti-epidemic technologies and methods and their knock-on impacts on principles of digital freedom and civic rights. To be an effective counterweight against the shifting balance towards authoritarian principles in the digital world, the United States and other like-minded democracies would be best served by presenting an attractive alternative to China’s technology and limiting the appeal of Beijing’s intrusive response model. Washington’s chance to lead by example has long since passed; however, by uplifting successful democratic governments like those in Taiwan, South Korea, and New Zealand as the gold standard for responsible use of epidemiological technology, perhaps the United States can play a role in ensuring that the future of fighting disease does not come at the expense of civic and digital freedoms.

Some protesters are also pushing for reforms to the monarchy -- until recently a taboo subject.  HOW DID THE PROTESTS START?  Anti-government protests first emerged late last year after courts banned Future Forward, the most vocal party opposing the government of former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha and one that drew strong support among Thai youths.  The protests went largely online while curbs were in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but re-emerged in mid-July. Since then, demonstrations organised by student groups have taken place almost daily.  There was strong student representation at the protest on Sunday, but there were also many older people among the crowds.  WHAT ARE THE PROTESTERS DEMANDING?  The are three key demands: For Prayuth's government to step down, for a new constitution to be drawn up and for an end to the harassment of opposition activists.  But some students have also presented 10 demands for reforms to the powerful monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.  These include curbs on his constitutional powers as well as his authority over the palace fortune and armed forces. They also want an end to the monarchy's role in politics, but emphasise they are not seeking to abolish it.  Such public demands for change by any group are unprecedented in living memory.  WHAT IS DRIVING THE GRIEVANCES?  Opponents of Prayuth accuse him of maintaining the power he first seized in a 2014 coup through an election last year that was held under rules that favoured him. He disputes this.  Other factors have also emerged, including anger over accusations of government corruption and a feeling that the Thai elite acts with impunity. Meanwhile, poverty has been exacerbated by the collapse of the crucial tourist industry as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.  The disappearance of a Thai anti-government activist in Cambodia, the latest of nine to go missing in recent years, has fuelled disaffection.  Many young Thais also voice frustration with an establishment that emphasises obedience to authorities and tradition, with the monarchy described by the constitution as ""enthroned in a position of revered worship"".  HOW HAS THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED?  The government has said that people are allowed to show dissent and Prayuth has said he seeks dialogue with the protesters.  But three student protest leaders have already been arrested and released on bail on charges over the earlier protests, and police say there are warrants for the arrest of a further 12.  Prayuth has said the king has requested him not to use the lese majeste laws that provide for up to 15 years in prison for anyone insulting the monarchy.  WHAT OPPOSITION IS THERE TO THE PROTESTERS?  There have been a handful of pro-monarchy demonstrations to counter the anti-government protests, but even the biggest has drawn no more than a few dozen people.  Those have included former members of the strongly royalist yellow shirts, who for more than a decade before the last coup had clashed with red shirt protesters loyal to former populist prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.  Some former red shirts have meanwhile appeared at the anti-government protests.  This has stirred concerns in Thailand that there could be a return to the street violence of the past, although so far the protests have been peaceful.  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?  Protesters have vowed to continue taking action until their demands are met.  The protests, and particularly the criticism of the monarchy, have put the government in a bind.  Political analysts have said that if it acts too harshly, it risks provoking a backlash that will further encourage support for the protests. If it does not take strong action, however, the protesters may be further emboldened to break longstanding taboos.  (Writing by Matthew Tostevin; Editing by Catherine Evans)"

Climate change is a critical challenge that Southeast Asia must confront as the region seeks to expand its economy and remain a key engine of growth for the world, McKinsey Global Institute said in a report.  Asia as a region faces hazards including flooding, drought, severe typhoons as well as conditions of rising heat and humidity.  The coronavirus pandemic is ""highlighting the importance of risk and resilience to lives and livelihoods, and as the world focuses on recovery, it is important to not lose sight of the role that climate plays,"" Jonathan Woetzel, a director at McKinsey Global Institute who is leading the research, said in a statement.  ""Asia faces climate hazards with potentially severe socioeconomic impacts, and thus has a keen interest in playing a front-line role in addressing the challenges,"" Woetzel said.  In addition to the impact on Southeast Asia, the research also outlines the potential impact of extreme weather on countries like Bangladesh, India and Pakistan — a region they termed ""Frontier Asia.""  ""We estimate that by 2050, between 500 million and 700 million people in Frontier Asia could live in regions that have an annual probability of a lethal heat wave of about 20 percent,"" said the report.  Coastal flooding made worse by rising sea levels is a severe risk around the world and reports have estimated trillions of dollars could be on the line from damaged assets in the future. Flooding not only damages infrastructure but sometimes contaminates sources of drinking water."

I could have stayed for five more years, so it was not an easy decision. I had and still have this “fire in my belly” aching to be used.  One nagging question was, “How will I redirect my passion?” Every day at work was a new day and there was never a dull moment. I had fun. But the circumstances were clear. My husband and I pulled out our residence from Bangkok back to Manila.  ADVERTISEMENT  I realized that I did not want to retire because I was in the right place at the right time, doing things that I loved most with the most intelligent, passionate, and fun-loving colleagues anyone could wish for. I had deep gladness in my heart while at work.  I remember this quote by Frederick Buechner: “The place where God calls you to is where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet.”  My work was not without challenges. It involved managing strategic engagement with various stakeholders amid possible reputational risks. As an advisor to management, I had to be constantly aware of the current sociopolitical situation. A few colleagues were unbelievably self-entitled. Control freaks… with whom I had to be too extra careful. Fortunately, there weren’t many.  To manage my passion, I did not allow myself to think that retirement is like going through a sunset, as many people say. No! Quite the opposite.  I called it my new sunrise. And I embraced it.  How tight has my embrace been? With the lockdown in Manila since March, how did I take each day? With a little help from the internet, slow as it was, each day was greeted with anticipation. And every bedtime was filled with thanksgiving.  And what about my new sunrise?  A few days after my retirement, I went back to the University of the Philippines, which has helped me be who I am today. But this time, I went back to pay forward—by teaching a course on Strategic Communications to a group of young people pursuing master’s degrees. I volunteered to help an NGO deliver a course on cross-cultural communications. I wrote two articles that were published in a local national daily. I also contributed to a booklet on COVID-19 which addressed the questions, fears, anxieties, and anger of many people.  I help our local church. I also try to support a group of brave volunteers who cook to distribute hot breakfast meals to street dwellers in Quezon City. I am directing a weekly show on Facebook that livestreams conversations on faith and development issues, amid this pandemic. I have been saving gym fees and getting better results through daily exercises promoted on the internet. I cook, thanks to YouTube which has been my faithful mentor, so I am no longer a “woman of order” (I used to order for food and drinks). I am now preparing to teach again—this time, a course on Participatory Communication, via remote learning methods.

Jobless rate among the youth aged 15 and above is likely to hit as high as 19.5% by yearend if the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is contained within 6 months, resulting into 1.02 million in job losses, the Asian Development Bank and International Labour Organization said in a joint report.  Related Stories Job losses rise despite economic reopening  A slightly lower rate of 15.1%, equivalent to 687,000 youth jobs getting wiped out, may be recorded if COVID-19 is put under control within 3 months. When the virus containment started is unclear, although the multilateral agencies said it already “began at different times in each country.”  At any point of containment, youth unemployment is still expected to more than double from last year’s 6.8%, a scenario that is likely to reflect trends in the Asia Pacific region this year. “Young people will be hit harder than adults in the immediate crisis and also bear higher longer-term economic and social costs,” ADB and ILO said.  The report, which highlights the pandemic’s repercussions on youth employment across the region, casts a grim shadow on policymakers’ efforts to revive their economies, especially on countries like the Philippines which rely on their young workforce for economic prosperity.  Across the region, the Philippines is seen faring better in youth employment than Sri Lanka, which may see youth unemployment climb to 37.8%, Fiji (36.8%), India (32.5%), Mongolia (30.4%), Indonesia (25.3%), Bangladesh (24.8%), Thailand (22.1%) and Pakistan (21.5%).  Meanwhile, the local youth jobless rate is seen worse than projections for Vietnam (13.2%), Cambodia (13.1%), Nepal (6.1%) and Lao PDR (2.7%).  Government internships scaled down  Indeed, at the latest government Labor Force Survey last April, the jobless rate among youth already more than doubled to 31.6% year-on-year. Labor Assistant Secretary Dominique Rubia Tutay said government initiatives to salvage jobs are in “full swing.”  “Our youth programs such as Special Program for Employment of Students and the Government Internship Program are also ongoing though on a limited capacity,” Tutay said in Viber message when asked to comment on the report.  At the onset, COVID-19 and lockdowns enforced to slow virus transmission disproportionately hit sectors where youth are mostly employed. These were wholesale and retail trade where 23% of employed youths earn a living, accommodation and food services (11%) and manufacturing (10%).  Apart from layoffs among full-time employees, ADB and ILO said recruitments for internships and apprenticeships were also halted because companies were reeling from closures due to lockdowns. This comes on top of three-quarters of existing internships that were “completely interrupted as a result of the pandemic.”  If not let go, interns were easily left without wages and stipends after the pandemic struck, the report said.  The problem appears more severe if newly graduates are counted. In the domestic market, ADB and ILO said firms have no appetite to hire young people, or even if they do, job tenure, and therefore benefits, is something lacking.  Measures targeting youth needed  To “minimize future scarring” in the youth job sector, ADB and ILO said “large-scale and targeted” measures should be employed, including wage subsidies and offering government work opportunities, including apprenticeships.  “Prioritizing youth employment and maximizing youth productivity in the COVID-19 recovery process will improve Asia and the Pacific’s future prospects for inclusive and sustainable growth, demographic transition and social stability,” the joint report said. — with Prinz Magtulis"

The survey, conducted in November and December, covered 9,975 Japanese companies with strong interest in overseas business and drew responses from 3,562, or 35.7 percent.  Meanwhile, about 80 percent of companies operating overseas forecast that sales this year will drop from the previous year due to shrinking demand from the coronavirus pandemic, the annual report said.  In Asia, 91.4 percent of Japanese companies in India, 89.4 percent in Malaysia, 88.4 percent in Thailand, 85.3 percent in the Philippines and 84.4 percent in Indonesia made such forecasts.

Outspoken political analyst Kim Sok has agreed to return to Cambodia from self-imposed exile to lead what he has termed “mass demonstrations for social justice” if Prime Minister Hun Sen delivers on a promise to send an airplane to bring him home.  On Sunday, while speaking at the opening of an entertainment complex outside of the capital Phnom Penh, Hun Sen dared Kim Sok to return home from Finland, where he was offered asylum in October 2018.  “This contemptible guy [recently] called for people from all walks of life, including workers and farmers, to stage a protest for change,” he said.  “Go ahead and come! I will send an airplane to take you [to Cambodia,] and when you arrive, I won’t do anything to you—I’ll let you lead the demonstration. Will you dare [to come]?”  Cambodia’s government has faced growing criticism over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, its failure to address human rights and democracy issues that prompted the EU to level tough trade sanctions last week, and most recently for allegedly allowing Vietnam to encroach on Cambodian territory along the two countries’ shared border.  Kim Sok has joined the chorus of voices slamming Hun Sen’s leadership.  The commentator was jailed on Feb. 17, 2017, after Hun Sen accused him of implying that the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) had orchestrated the 2016 murder of popular political pundit Kem Ley.  Just days before he was gunned down on July 10, 2016, Kem Ley had discussed on an RFA Khmer Service call-in show a report by London-based Global Witness detailing the extent of the wealth of the family of Hun Sen.  Kim Sok was released on Aug. 17, 2018 but fled to neighboring Thailand, where he spent weeks in hiding after the prime minister issued an order to have him re-arrested. He was offered asylum in Finland and relocated there in October that year.  Hun Sen said Sunday he had “let [Kim Sok] leave” Cambodia two years ago.  “He would not have been able to leave the country if I had wanted to arrest him because my people had followed him to the [Thai] border and they asked me to order his arrest,” he said. “I said, ‘Just let him go because he was already imprisoned once.’”  Kim Sok responded Monday by urging Hun Sen to honor his promise.  “I am prepared to make sacrifices in order to lead a popular mass demonstration in Cambodia if Hun Sen genuinely sends an airplane to take me to Phnom Penh, as he said,” the commentator told RFA’s Khmer Service.  “I will take the lead in the protest to struggle for justice for our people. I urge all government civil servants, workers, and social activists to join hands and stand up to fight for our poor country. I know a majority of government civil servants do not like the CPP, so it is time to stage protests everywhere.”  Kim Sok also called on the acting president of the banned opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) Sam Rainsy, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Paris, France since 2015, and CNRP chief Kem Sokha, who is facing charges of “treason” for an alleged plot to topple the government, “to be prepared to lead the country, because their party was elected and half of the nation voted for them.”  The Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP in November 2017, two months after Kem Sokha’s arrest, for its role in opposition leader’s alleged scheme. The ban, along with a wider crackdown on NGOs and the independent media, paved the way for Hun Sen’s CPP to win all 125 seats in parliament in the country’s July 2018 general election.  KWP chief Suong Sophorn takes part in a protest demanding the release of union leader Rong Chhun in front of the Phnom Penh Municipal Court in Phnom Penh, July 31, 2020. RFA  The exchange between Hun Sen and Kim Sok came as Cambodia’s little-known opposition Khmer Win Party (KWP) called on the U.S. Embassy to intervene in the arrest of its president, Suong Sophorn, who was arrested on Aug. 14 and also charged with “incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest” following comments he made alleging that Vietnam had encroached on Cambodian territory.  KWP spokesperson Yin Yoeun told RFA his party had submitted a petition to the embassy on Sunday by an official who pledged to respond by Aug. 20. He said that he and another party official had been tailed by security forces who demanded to know the content of the petition.  “We will approach all embassies of nations that were signatories to the Paris Peace Agreement to help us because they helped bring about democracy to Cambodia,” he said, referring to the Paris Peace Accords of 1991, which ended civil war and established democratic elections in the country.  Suong Sophorn’s arrest came just two weeks after prominent union leader Rong Chhun was officially charged with “incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest” under Article 495 of Cambodia’s Penal Code and jailed at Prey Sar Prison in Phnom Penh on Aug. 1.  The Cambodian Confederation of Unions (CCU) president had been arrested a day earlier for claiming the government has allowed Vietnam to encroach on farmland along the border. His arrest has prompted near-daily protests in the capital by supporters demanding his release.  Earlier this month, the KWP notified Phnom Penh city officials that it planned to lead a protest on Aug. 16 to demand Rong Chhun’s release but was denied permission, prompting the party to release a statement calling the ban a violation of the freedom of expression, democratic principles, and Cambodian law.  Hours before his arrest, Suong Sophorn told RFA he intended to defy the ban and planned to issue a statement about the irregularities he discovered while visiting the border area, even if it meant being sent to jail.  Yin Yoeun said Monday that Suong Sophorn’s arrest was different than that of Rong Chhun because the former had spoken about the border as a politician.  “When a politician in a democratic country cannot speak out about the border issue, how can the people?” he questioned. “This is seriously affecting democracy in the country.”  Yin Yoeun told RFA the KWP maintains that Suong Sophorn is innocent of the charges against him and had not broken any laws. He said the party has no plans to announce a new leader to avoid dissolution but will suspend plans to visit the border with Vietnam and hold a demonstration in the capital as it focuses on seeking justice for Suong Sophorn.  RFA was unable to reach government spokesperson Phay Siphan for comment on Suong Sophorn’s case on Monday, but both he and Justice Ministry spokesperson Chhin Malin have said that petitioning foreign embassies will have no impact on Cambodian court decisions.  Cambodian police confront Khmer Thavarak protesters demanding the release of Rong Chhun in front of the Phnom Penh Municipal Courthouse in Phnom Penh, Aug. 13, 2020. RFA  Hun Sen on Sunday had vowed to “arrest anyone, regardless of number, who speaks out about the border.”  Last week, police violently dispersed a protest outside of the Phnom Penh Municipal Court calling for Rong Chhun’s release and arrested six of the union leader’s youth supporters from the civil society group Khmer Thavarak.  Chhoeun Daravy and Hun Vannak were charged with “incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest,” and “obstructing the authorities,” while the other four were released.  Khmer Thavarak member Keut Saray told RFA Monday that although the authorities are now closely watching the group’s activities, it will continue to demand justice for Chhoeun Daravy and Hun Vannak, including through social media statements.  Another group member, Van Chanthoeun, said he and others are now being monitored by authorities but will not give up the fight for their release.  National Police spokesperson Chhay Kimkhoeun and Phay Siphan could not be reach for comment on the charges facing Chhoeun Daravy and Hun Vannak, but the Justice Ministry’s Chhin Malin has warned that authorities would take “further legal action” if the youth group continued to hold protests.  The leader of the Young Commentator Group, Ly Srey Sroh, told RFA Monday that the government should provide a free space for its own people, particularly the youth, to fully exercise their rights.  “As part of the democracy building process, people must be brave enough to demand their rights, despite any moves by the authorities to ban or suppress them,” she said.  Political commentator Seng Sary said that the government is “too lazy to solve the people’s problems” and instead routinely issues warnings and threats “to frighten them.”  “The government likes to use [suppression] to achieve quick result, but such tactics create anger and rage inside the hearts of the people,” he said.

Prime Minister Hun Sen is politicizing a dispute over Cambodia’s shared border with Vietnam to divert public attention from the European Union’s reinstatement of tariffs on key exports that threatens to implode the country’s already weak economy, an opposition official charged Tuesday.  The withdrawal of duty-free, quota-free access to the EU’s market under the “Everything But Arms” (EBA) scheme for some 20 percent of Cambodia’s exports—a decision that was announced in February—went into effect on Aug. 12.  The EU’s move came in response to the Hun Sen government’s failure to reverse rollbacks on democracy and other freedoms required under the trade arrangement. Affected exports include goods from Cambodia’s vital garment and footwear industries.  Rather than acquiesce to EU demands, Hun Sen has doubled down and used allegations that his government allowed Vietnam to encroach on Cambodian territory as a pretext to arrest outspoken critics, Eng Chhay Eang, deputy president of the banned opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), told RFA’s Khmer Service.  He pointed to the arrest this month of union leader Rong Chhun for claiming the government has allowed Vietnam to encroach on farmland along their shared border. Since then, supporters have held near-daily protests demanding his release.  And while Hun Sen had said that EU demands to maintain the EBA were unreasonable and an interference in Cambodia’s internal affairs, the prime minister has largely kept silent about the withdrawal because he fears reinstatement of tariffs on the country’s remaining 80 percent of exports, Eng Chhay Eang said.  “In fact, Hun Sen is really concerned, internally,” he said.  “We know that Cambodia’s economy nowadays is already facing serious issues—not to mention this economic sanction.”  The CNRP last week condemned Hun Sen’s government for failing to implement reforms required by the EU to avoid trade sanctions and called on the bloc to sanction Hun Sen and other officials deemed responsible for rights violations in Cambodia through visa restrictions and the freezing of their assets, saying that the tariffs would largely only impact the country’s workers.  The CNRP also urged the government to reinstate its party—one of the conditions called for by the EU—and initiate a process of national reconciliation through inclusive dialogue. The CNRP was dissolved in November 2017 for its role in an alleged plot to topple the government, paving the way for Hun Sen’s ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats in parliament in the country’s July 2018 general election.  The 20 percent EBA withdrawal is expected to have a significant impact on the economy in Cambodia, which exported U.S. $6.4 billion in goods, mostly from its garment sector, to the EU in 2018—accounting for 45 percent of Cambodia’s total exports that year.  The EBA has been crucial for Cambodia’s U.S. $10 billion apparel industry, which employs 900,000 workers, but has seen mass layoffs and factory suspensions amid a slow in demand during the coronavirus pandemic.  Rong Chhun, president of the Cambodian Confederation of Unions (CCU), was officially charged with “incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest” under Article 495 of Cambodia’s Penal Code and jailed at Prey Sar Prison in Phnom Penh on Aug 1.  Prior to his arrest, Rong Chhun had criticized the government’s response to the coronavirus and, last month, wrote to Hun Sen calling on him to proactively address the issues that the EU has said prompted it to end Cambodia’s trade privileges.  Grip on power  Speaking to RFA on Tuesday, government spokesperson Phay Siphan dismissed claims that Hun Sen is using the border issue to downplay EU trade sanctions and said the reason the prime minister hasn’t commented on the EBA withdrawal is because he had already made his view clear.  “Such analysis doesn’t reflect the actual situation,” he said of recent arrests over the border dispute.  “As for the EBA issue, we have already spoken on it since February. It serves no interest to repeatedly discuss this issue. Our position remains the same.”  According to Phay Siphan, Cambodia’s government plans to hold further discussions with the EU about the remaining 80 percent of exports covered by the EBA, but he declined to comment on whether talks would include the 20 percent that had been withdrawn.  But Kean Punlorn, secretary-general of the Federation of Cambodian Intellectuals and Students, said there is little hope for the government to maintain remaining trade preferences under the EBA without giving up something in return.  He said that failure to meet EU demands shows that the government is only concerned about its grip on power, rather than the interests of the workers, and agreed with Eng Chhay Eang that the border issue is a diversion.  “The 20 percent withdrawal is only the first step taken by the EU and there will be further or subsequent steps when the government fails to restore democracy and respect human rights,” he said.  “Once more people lose their jobs, there will be protests and strikes within the country. So, the reason that [Hun Sen] has failed to raise and respond to this issue is in order to divert the entire population’s attention.”  Rong Chhun discusses border demarcation with villagers in Tbong Khmum province’s Ponhea Kraek district, July 21, 2020. Photo courtesy of villagers  The tactic appears to be working in part, as unresolved border issues between Cambodia and Vietnam, former French colonies from the 1860s to 1954, have regularly inflamed nationalist sentiment. The disputed border has sparked incidents in the past, with the construction by Vietnam of military posts in contested areas quickly challenged by Cambodian authorities in Phnom Penh.  A joint communique signed by Cambodia and Vietnam in 1995 stipulates that neither side can make any changes to border markers or allow cross-border cultivation or settlement pending the resolution of outstanding border issues.  The issue again came to the forefront after Rong Chhun’s July 20 visit to Trapeang Phlong commune, in Tbong Khmum province’s Ponhea Kraek district, where Cambodians claimed recently placed border posts had caused them to lose land to neighboring Vietnam.  The following day, he issued a statement on behalf of the Cambodia Watchdog Council (CWC) in which he cited irregularities with the placement of border posts 114 to 119 that resulted in the loss of “hundreds of hectares” (one hectare = 2.5 acres) of ancestral land belonging to area farmers.  The CWC says that farmers are losing land because Cambodia is demarcating the border based on a 1985 treaty from Vietnam’s 1979-89 occupation of the country following its ouster of the Khmer Rouge regime. It was during the occupation that Hun Sen began his 35-year rule over Cambodia.  Cambodia’s official Cambodia Border Committee on July 31 rejected Rong Chhun’s claims that farmers had lost land, saying the CWC had disseminated “fake news” based on “groundless accusations.” He was arrested for “incitement” the same day.  Since then, two of Rong Chhun’s supporters from the civil society group Khmer Thavarak have been charged with crimes in connection to a protest calling for him to be freed, while Suong Sophorn, the president of the little-known opposition Khmer Win Party (KWP), was arrested and charged with “incitement” after visiting the border and making similar accusations.  Increased frustration  Hun Sen on Aug. 16 warned that anyone who speaks out about the Vietnamese border will now face arrest, but the threat of an increased crackdown has only increased public frustration and questions over the government’s handling of the situation, sources told RFA.  Law student Heoun Sreynich said Hun Sen’s warning was acting in violation of Cambodia’s constitution by prohibiting people from exercising their rights.  “The constitution stipulates that people have ‘rights and duty,’ which means they have the right to take part in protecting state sovereignty,” she said.  Phnom Penh resident Reoun Veasan, meanwhile, suggested Hun Sen “is trying to hide his fault of secretly signing a border treaty with Vietnam that resulted in Cambodia losing land.”  Soth Ban, a political science graduate, said that as Cambodia’s leader it is Hun Sen’s job to explain the border situation if the public does not understand it.  “His speech was a bit brutal and insolent—as a country leader, he should show decency because he is supposed to be a role model for the people,” he said.  “He has power so he can say whatever he wants, but we youth still love the nation and will continue to monitor the development of the border issue.”  CWC president Men Nath called Hun Sen’s threat “a big mistake” and said that people with opposing viewpoints must be allowed to express them.  “Activists and those who monitor the border only demand one thing, which is to resolve the border issue with transparency,” he said. “Put it on the table, don’t do it secretly.”  Reported by RFA’s Khmer Service.

Mark Demayo, ABS-CBN News/File  MANILA - The youth aged 15 to 24 years in the Asia and the Pacific would be “hit harder” by the COVID-19 pandemic, a report released Tuesday showed.  The youth faces greater losses since nearly half of them were employed in the 4 major sectors hardest hit by the crisis, which are wholesale, retail, trade and repair, manufacturing, rental and business services, and accommodation and food services, the International Labor Organization said in a statement.  The youth will likely suffer from “longer-term” economic and social costs, said an International Labor Organization - Asian Development Bank report called “Tackling the COVID-19 youth employment crisis in Asia and the Pacific.  Employment for the youth were affected through job disruptions or reduced working hours and earnings, job losses for both paid workers and self-employed, disruptions in education and training, difficulties in transitioning from school to work and moving between jobs in a recession, the study showed.  “The pre-crisis challenges for youth are now amplified since COVID-19 hit. Without sufficient attention, our fear is that this risk creating a ‘lockdown generation’ that could feel the weight of this crisis for many years to come,” says Sara Elder, a lead author of the report and head of the ILO Regional Economic and Social Analysis unit.  In the first quarter of 2020, youth unemployment “increased sharply” in 6 out of 9 economies including Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam, as well as Hong Kong and China, the ILO said.  While youth unemployment is predicted to reach at least double the 2019 estimates in Cambodia, Fiji, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand.  Unemployment in the Philippines in April ballooned 17.7 percent to 7.3 million, while a recent SWS survey showed at least 45.5 percent of adults were jobless  The study predicted that between 10 to 15 million jobs for the youth could be lost across 13 countries in Asia and the Pacific this year.  The ILO and the ADB recommend that youth employment should be prioritized in COVID-19 recovery efforts for inclusive and sustainable growth."

Authorities in Thailand’s Deep South said Tuesday they had arrested 36 Vietnamese fishermen and confiscated their four boats on suspicion of poaching in Thai waters.  The arrests came two days after Malaysia’s coast guard shot and killed a Vietnamese fishing boat crew member during a South China Sea confrontation, and weeks after Indonesian authorities detained three Vietnamese boats for alleged poaching.  Officials received a tip about the presence of Vietnamese fishing boats inside Thailand’s 200-nautical-mile (370-km) exclusive economic zone, and found them about 92 nautical miles (170 km) off Cape Tachi in Pattani province, said Capt. Thiranan Madaeng of the Second Fleet’s Thai Marine Enforcement Command Center.  “We found four fishing boats and 36 crews and we escorted them to our shore,” Thiranan told reporters gathered at a fishing pier in the province.  He said Yaring district police filed five charges against the 36, including fishing without a permit and illegal entry. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the detainees, who were assisted by a translator, were screened by local public health staff.  A police officer who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media told BenarNews that the crew members were being detained at the Yaring police station.  While deckhands are subject to fine of up to U.S. $6,000 (187,000 baht) and the captains even more, depending on the size of their boats, detainees are generally tried in court and deported as soon as possible, the officer said.  Thiranan said authorities had arrested 165 Vietnamese crew members and confiscated 26 boats in 13 incidents since October 2019.  The Vietnamese Embassy did not respond to a BenarNews request for comment.  Pattani province in Thailand’s Deep South is one of Thailand’s major fishing hubs, and businesses there employ more than 10,000 immigrants from Cambodia and Myanmar.  Second incident in two days  The arrests come two days after members of the Malaysian coast guard shot and killed a Vietnamese sailor during a violent confrontation with Vietnamese-flagged fishing boats suspected of encroaching in Malaysian waters of the South China Sea.  The Malaysian boat was approaching two Vietnamese fishing boats to conduct an inspection when it was rammed and attacked with Molotov cocktails and hard objects including metal rods, lumber blocks and wrenches, a Malaysian maritime official said.  “(Our crew) had no choice in their effort to defend themselves, their lives, and (the ship) but to discharge their weapons toward the fishing boat,” Malaysia Maritime Enforcement Agency Chief Mohd Zubil Mat Som said.  Vietnamese officials expressed deep concern over the incident and demanded those responsible for the death be held to account.  In Indonesia, authorities detained a Vietnamese boat and nine crew members carrying two tons of fish on July 26 as it was allegedly operating illegally in the North Natuna Sea bordering the South China Sea. On July 21, Indonesian officials detained two Vietnamese fishing boats after what they described as a dramatic high-seas brawl.  Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service."

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures that help identify underlying trends in the Company's business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses and gains that the Company includes in loss from operations and net loss. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making.

Indonesian Consulate Tawau chief Sulistijo Djati Ismojo said their nation’s Foreign Ministry had to conduct the virtual launch due to the pandemic which has affected the whole world.  “We initially planned to invite the Foreign Minister to come to Tawau for the launch of the new building last March as soon as we moved into the new structure, but it had to be postponed.  “In the end, we decide to do it online, in line with the new norm to curb further spread of Covid-19, ” Sulistijo said.  The virtual launch also saw Retno simultaneously officiate the Indonesian Embassy building in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  Meanwhile, Sulistijo said the new building, which they own, has more space and better facilities for the staff to conduct their work especially in assisting Indonesians in that area.  Indonesia first opened its representative office in Tawau in 1968 and has been renting at six different premises since then."

Beginning in October, the 183-year-old luxury retailer will provide expanded origin details for newly sourced, individually registered diamonds that trace the stone’s path from the ground to the jewellery case. The project, which the company says is an industry-first, took nearly two decades to complete due to the challenges of tracking down sourcing information.  “The diamond industry is still, on the whole, very opaque about the jewellery supply chain,” said Anisa Kamadoli Costa, Tiffany’s chief sustainability officer.  The jewellery market, now reeling from a precipitous drop in demand amid the Covid-19 pandemic, remains murky even after decades of reform over concerns about human rights abuses at mines and factories. The sector has annual sales of about $80 billion, according to De Beers.  Human rights violations  Tiffany said it doesn’t acquire diamonds from areas of concern, such as Zimbabwe and Angola, where international observers say mining is associated with human rights violations. A look at the company’s vast global supply chain, which stretches from Namibia to Cambodia and beyond, shows the challenges of tracking a product that often measures just a few millimetres across.  The company’s diamonds are mined by suppliers in countries including South Africa, Russia and Namibia, then brought to Belgium for sorting. From there, the rough stones travel to countries such as Mauritius, Botswana or Cambodia to be cut and polished, and then head to laboratories in the US and South-East Asia for grading and quality control. Those that pass go on to Tiffany facilities to be put in jewellery and shipped out to stores. The majority of its diamonds are set at US factories.  The new disclosures, which include details on where a stone was mined, sorted, graded, cut and set, expand on Tiffany’s effort last year to begin providing the country of origin for its diamonds. The jeweller increased its headcount by more than 2,000 from 2017 to 2019, mostly in diamond facilities abroad and domestic jewellery manufacturing, and developed systems to track individually-registered stones.  Tiffany spokesperson Nathan Strauss declined to specify what the expanded disclosures cost the company, noting that the company had invested many millions in vertical integration over two decades.  “The tracing project is the culmination of years of investments to expand Tiffany’s diamond operations and lengthy talks with mines to gather the necessary information,” said Andrew Hart,” Tiffany’s senior vice-president of diamond and jewellery supply.  “It took us quite a long time to build all that up and to develop some critical mass and to convince our rough mining partners to be more transparent,” he said."

Thailand has identified five industries namely food and biotechnology; biochemicals and biofuels; medical and wellness and smart electronics technology as new sources of economic growth over the coming decades. These industries serve the development of BCG which leverages on the country’s robust agricultural sector, advancing competitiveness in biotechnology and growing pool of skilled workforce.  Two World Bank’s studies reaffirms Thailand’s overall competitive business environments. In the 2020 Ease of Doing Business Index, Thailand is ranked 21st out of 190 economies1. In the Logistics Performance Index biennial study, Thailand was ranked 32nd out of 160 countries in 2018, second only to Singapore in ASEAN2.  As a testament of the country’s progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, consultancy firm Dual Citizen ranked Thailand at the 2nd place in ASEAN and 27th place out of 130 countries on its 2018 Global Green Economy Index. The ranking reflects the country’s performance in leadership and climate change, efficient use of resources, markets and investment, and environment3 indicators.  Thailand’s competitive advantages in BCG is on an improving trend as the public sector is pushing ahead plans to promote BCG industries and accelerate large investment projects in bioeconomy including biochemical and biorefinery facilities and technological upgrade in the food industry.  Tapping the Country’s Food Security and Saving the Planet  Thailand is building on the momentum of strong global demand for its food and processed food products during the pandemic to improve competitiveness of the food industry, with a target to become ASEAN’s leading hub for processed food by 2027.  The Ministry of Industry is investing US$ 213 million worth of budget over nine years to upgrade technology across food-related industries’ supply chains, ranging from R&D to processing, packaging, marketing and exports. The Thai government predicts that the development plan for food industry to crowd in an investment of US$ 71 million as part of the development plan within the timeframe.  The objective is to place Thailand among the world’s top ten food exporters with the total shipment value of US$ 46 billion, comparing with the position of the world’s eleventh largest food exporter and the total shipments worth US$ 33 billion in 2019. The Federation of Thai Industries Thailand forecasts Thailand’s food exports to hold up or increase slightly, at a range between US$ 33 billion to US$ 34 billion in 2020, despite global impacts of the pandemic4.  Having one of the world’s largest plantation of cassava, sugarcane and oil palm, Thailand also possesses growing prospects of the biofuel and biochemical industries to feed the production of high-value products ranging from amino acid, ethanol, electricity, biopharmaceutical products as well as polylactic acid and Polybutylene succinate: PBS used for production of bioplastic products.  Thailand’s Office of Industrial Economics estimates that biotechnology products will grow 14% annually worldwide, with biochemicals recording the highest growth at 16%, following by bioplastics and biopharmaceuticals. This trend represents a significant opportunity for Thailand’s BCG economy.  The Public Private Partnership for Sustainable Plastic and Waste Management has launched a pilot project in Rayong Province. Led by the provincial governor, the project has proven to be successful with the participation of 17 municipalities. Moreover, waste segregation has created jobs in some of these municipalities. The income deriving from this project can cover the cost of the communities’ waste treatment and can be spared to fund other waste segregation-related activities.  Joining Global Efforts to Curb the Pandemic  Thailand’s strength in biotechnology and medical sector and the country’s preparedness to handle pandemics have underpinned the country’s success in containing the pandemic of the COVID-19 virus.  Local biotechnology researchers and medical device manufacturers have played an important role to ensure frontline health practitioners and Thai population are well equipped with protective gears and speedy diagnostic approaches.  The National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)’s National Omics Center has successfully developed test kits which enables local laboratories to detect ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the SARS-CoV-2 virus with a more affordable price tag than using commercial kits. The National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC) has innovated “Loop-mediated isothermal amplification” technique to detect DNA and RNA of the virus almost at an equivalent efficiency of real time PCR method. Thai laboratories also use immunochromatography method to detects the virus for proactive tracking of new infections.  More importantly, Thai researchers have joined the global race for vaccine development against the COVID-19 virus. Thailand is carrying out experiments and clinical trials for three types of the vaccines: DNA, mRNA and plant-based proteins. Thai researchers could emerge as an inventor of the vaccine later this year with mRNA method now making the most advanced progress. The human testing for the vaccine is expected to begin within this year for the vaccine to be produced and distributed locally towards end of 2021.  Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health pledges strong support for local mass production of any successful vaccine prototypes for use not only in Thailand, but also the group of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV) and other member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  In a partnership with Mahidol University, Thailand Centre of Excellence for Life Sciences is also studying active compounds in Thai herbs that could control the COVID-19 virus, potentially leading to drug development in preparation for any possible future outbreaks.  The research found extracts from finger-roots and gingers have the capability to inhibit growth of the virus. The result was proven by comparison tests with FDA-approved drugs used to treat the COVID-19 patients5.  Local researchers are well known for application of genomics technology to treat life-threatening diseases such as thalassemia, cardiovascular illnesses, AIDS and leukemia in children, as well as identifying genomic markers that cause adverse drug reactions. The result has laid the foundation for Thailand’s development of its personalized medicine-based business.  BOI Measures Driving BCG Economy  The BOI is offering an exemption of corporate income tax for up to eight years to a comprehensive range of the agricultural biotechnology industries. Eligible sectors under the incentive program include plant and animal breeding, economic crop plantation, biofertilizer production, animal husbandry, food production, and more advanced agricultural biotechnology such as active ingredient and medical food productions.  To promote BCG model further, the BOI’s board meeting on 17 June 2020, agreed to offer five-year tax incentives to plant factory projects. The technology is aimed at aiding the steady production of high-quality plants all year round by controlling the cultivation environment.  Moreover, the BOI has increased tax incentives to encourage Environment-friendly technological adoptions, innovation and sustainable development in businesses including pet food and animal feed production, grading, packaging and storage of farm products, and production from agricultural waste.  As part of non-tax privileges, the BOI grants permission to promoted non-Thai companies to own land and their non-Thai shareholders to hold unlimited sharing holding. The BOI grants so-called smart visas that enable high-skilled professionals, investors, executives, and entrepreneurs in startups in Thailand’s 13 targeted industries and their families to stay in the country to up to four years without having to obtain a work permit.  1 https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings  2 https://lpi.worldbank.org/international/scorecard/radar/254/C/THA/2018#chartarea  3 https://dualcitizeninc.com/global-green-economy-index/index.php#interior_section_link  4 https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1909476/cabinet-gives-green-light-to-food-processing-plan  5 http://www.tcels.or.th/News/Press-Release/2216"

According to a statement, the initiative is one of the 11 proposals to receive initial funding under IFAD's Rural Poor Stimulus Facility (RPSF), comes as a result of a new partnership between IFAD and Precision Agriculture for Development (PAD), a global non-profit organisation co-founded by Nobel Prize winning economist Michael Kremer.  It pointed out that using mobile phone technology, farmers would receive low-cost, customised advice to improve on-farm practices, input utilisation, pest and disease management, environmental sustainability and access to markets.  IFAD's RPSF, which was launched recently by IFAD's UN Goodwill Ambassadors, the actor and humanitarian Idris Elba and the model and activist Sabrina Dhowre Elba, aims to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods and food security of rural poor people.  ""Funding for these first 11 initiatives, amounting to $11.2 million from the RPSF plus $5.2 million in co-financing mainly from governments and implementing partners, will benefit an estimated 6.7 million small-scale farmers in developing countries who are adversely impacted by the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""Among the proposals financed are two regionally focused initiatives in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa that will provide emergency livelihood support through local farmers' organisations, and eight country-level initiatives in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Nepal, Nigeria, Palestine and Rwanda.  ""The majority of these initiatives, which are embedded in national COVID-19 response strategies, will be implemented through IFAD project teams and other strategic partners to ensure fast delivery,"" it stated."

En Tailandia, un abogado y un estudiante activista fueron arrestados por su participación en protestas de democracia. Un líder de la unión camboyana fue detenido por sus declaraciones que expresan preocupación por los agricultores que, supuestamente, estaban perdiendo sus tierras en la frontera de Vietnam y Camboya. Tres oficinas de medios en Malasia fueron allanadas por incluir un documental sobre el trato del Gobierno a los trabajadores inmigrantes. Y finalmente, ocho acusados en Vietnam fueron condenados por “alterar la seguridad”.  Tailandia toma medidas contra la protesta de democracia  El abogado de derechos humanos Anon Nampa y el joven activista Panupong Jadnok fueron arrestados el 7 de agosto por su participación en protestas de democracia en julio.  En los últimos meses, se organizaron protestas que pedían reformas democráticas en el país. Activistas jóvenes han emitido tres demandas: detener el acoso a los ciudadanos, redactar una constitución nueva y disolver el Parlamento. También rechazaron un golpe militar como solución a la crisis política, que se intensificó cuando el Ejército tomó el poder en 2014.  Anon y Panupong fueron liberados bajo fianza al día siguiente. Además, se les ordenó que no volvieran a cometer los delitos que supuestamente cometieron. Después de su liberación, Anon juró continuar ejerciendo su libertad de expresión y agregó que aún pretende unirse a la manifestación de protesta el 16 de agosto. Tiene un mensaje para las autoridades:  We mean well to the country and respect those who think differently. We would like you to listen to us. We thank the officers who took good care of us, but as for those who do bad things, we are going to have to deal with them.  Tenemos buenas intenciones con el país y respetamos a quienes piensan diferente. Nos gustaría que nos escucharan. Agradecemos a los oficiales que nos cuidaron, pero en cuanto a los que hacen cosas malas, vamos a tener que lidiar con ellos.  Detienen a líder sindical camboyano  Rong Chhun, líder sindical camboyano y miembro del Consejo de Vigilancia de Camboya, fue arrestado el 31 de julio después de que el Comité de Asuntos Fronterizos de Camboya pidiera a las autoridades policiales que lo acusaran por “incitación a cometer delitos o provocar disturbios sociales” por difundir “noticias falsas” sobre un problema de tierras en la frontera de Vietnam con Camboya.  Después de visitar la frontera el 20 de julio, Rong Chhun emitió un comunicado para el Consejo de Vigilancia de Camboya en el que expresaba la preocupación de las comunidades agrícolas por la pérdida de sus tierras y culpaba a las autoridades.  Más tarde, Rong Chhun fue acusado por el Comité de Asuntos Fronterizos de Camboya por distorsionar el asunto.  Cerca de 141 grupos de la sociedad civil firmaron una declaración para pedir la liberación del líder sindical. También destacaron el efecto negativo de la detención de Rong Chhun:  This latest arrest of a respected union leader is a direct threat to every Cambodian who exercises their constitutional right to freely express their beliefs without having to fear a midnight visit by police and years lost in prison.  Este último arresto de un líder respetado de la unión es una amenaza directa a cada camboyano que ejerce su derecho constitucional de expresar libremente sus creencias sin tener miedo de una visita de la policía a media noche y años en prisión.

Allanan oficinas de medios en Malasia  La Policía hizo una redada en la oficina de Kuala Lumpur de AlJazeera, que bajo investigación por sedición luego de la transmisión de un documental sobre el trato del Gobierno a los inmigrantes durante la pandemia del COVID-19. Los medios de comunicación malayos ASTRO y UnifiTV también fueron allanados por transmitir el documental de Al Jazeera.  Las autoridades dijeron que el documental “Locked-up in Malaysia's Lockdown” (Encerrados durante el confinamiento en Malasia) era malicioso e impreciso pues afirma que los inmigrantes recibieron malos tratos en centros de inmigración.  Pero el Centro de Periodismo Independiente señaló que el Gobierno aún tiene que desmentir formalmente las acusaciones incluidas en el documental. Recomendaba a las autoridades enfocarse en investigar la situación de los inmigrantes en vez de intimidar a los medios:  We reiterate our call for the government to conduct an independent inquiry or investigation into the allegations, as reported in the documentary, and base its course of action on the results of said investigation.  Reiteramos nuestro llamado para que el Gobierno realice una investigación sobre las acusaciones, como se informa en el documental, y base su curso de acción en los resultados de dicha investigación.  Aparte de la redada, el Gobierno malayo no renovó las visas de trabajo de dos reporteros de AlJazeera:  “Con respecto a la redada policial en las oficinas de Al Jazeera en Kuala Lumpur ayer, citan que el inspector general de la Policía, Abdul Hamid Bador, dice que “al personal de Al Jazeera se le informó antes de nuestra intención de ir”. Al Jazeera afirma que no tuvimos notificación previa de la redada policial”.  Vietnam condenó a ocho periodistas y activistas  El 31 de julio, una corte en Ho Chi Minh City condenó a ocho acusados de “alteración a la seguridad”.  Uno de los condenados fue Ngo Van Dung, periodista y miembro de un colectivo de libertad de prensa vietnamita llamado Hien Phap Group (Grupo de Constitución). Esta red de periodistas y activistas está pidiendo la aplicación de una disposición en la Constitución vietnamita que supuestamente garantiza la libertad de expresión.  Ngo Van Dung estuvo en prisión preventiva por casi dos años después de su arresto en 2018. Fue sentenciado a cinco años en prisión seguido de dos años de libertad condicional.

Advertisement  As anti-government protests continue across Thailand, some student activists were recently accused of crossing a line by directly challenging the country’s powerful monarchy in a demonstration at Thammasat University’s Rangsit campus. This is not the first time Thammasat has been at the forefront of political upheaval in Thailand, and the memory of a dark day in 1976 serves as an ominous cloud over the activists who are daring to touch a topic long considered to be taboo.  This year’s anti-government protests began after the Constitutional Court of Thailand ordered the dissolution of the pro-democracy Future Forward Party in February, but soon fizzled out as large public gatherings were banned in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Tensions were heightened in early June with the disappearance of Wanchalearm Satsaksit, a prominent Thai pro-democracy activist. On June 4, Wanchalearm was abducted by armed men near his home in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where he had been living in exile since 2014. He has not been seen since.  The latest spate of demonstrations broke out on July 18 when thousands gathered at Bangkok’s Democracy Monument to protest against the government of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, a former army commander who has governed Thailand since leading a coup d’état in 2014. Organizers articulated three clear demands: the dissolution of parliament, an end to the punishment of government critics, and changes to the military-drafted constitution that protesters say rigged the deck in Prayut’s favor ahead of the 2019 elections.  Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter  Over the next several weeks, the demonstrations gained momentum. Student activists borrowed references from pop culture, adopting the three-fingered salute of defiance from the “Hunger Games” franchise and calling Thai government officials “Death Eaters,” a reference to the “Harry Potter” franchise. The ire of the student activists remained firmly focused on Prayut’s government and the persisting influence of the military over Thai politics.  Enjoying this article?

At the Rangsit campus of Thammasat University, located 42 kilometers north of Bangkok, Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, a 21-year-old student, stood on a stage and publicly questioned the monarchy. She laid out a 10-point manifesto calling for, among other things, a moderation of the monarchy’s use of public funds and an end to the lèse majesté law.  It is that very law that pro-royalists say Panusaya was openly defying when she called for reform of Thailand’s monarchy. The lèse majesté law, enshrined in the country’s criminal code and constitution, punishes anyone who is seen to defame or insult the royal family with prison sentences of three to 15 years. The law was last toughened in 1976, after an incident with striking similarities to this month’s demonstration at Thammasat.  On October 5 of that year, student activists at the Tha Phra Chan campus of Thammasat University, located in the heart of Bangkok, stood on a stage and performed a mock hanging. The student play was intended as a critique of the lynching of Chumporn Thummai and Wichai Ketsriphongsa, two pro-democracy activists who had been killed just weeks earlier. But accusations leveled by pro-royalists suggested the play actually featured the mock hanging of the crown prince, Maha Vajiralongkorn (now Thailand’s king).  Advertisement  The response was swift and brutal. On the evening of October 5, police and pro-royalist militias stormed the campus, engaging in a spree of beatings, sexual assaults, and lynchings. By the following afternoon, dozens were dead. Official reports claimed 46 dead and 167 wounded, but unofficial reports put the death toll at over 100. On the evening of October 6, the military launched a coup d’état, citing the student activists as a threat to the monarchy, returning Thailand to dictatorship after only three years of democracy.  This month’s demonstration has so far seen a more measured response from the government and pro-royalists. Prayut, the prime minister, has said authorities are looking to identify those involved in the protest, adding some may be arrested and punished under the lèse majesté law. Pro-royalists have staged their own protests in support of the monarchy.  Some activists have distanced themselves from the Thammasat manifesto, with the Free People group reaffirming its commitment to the three previously made demands for government reform.  But the Student Union of Thailand, whose leaders include Panusaya, the student who delivered the Thammasat manifesto on August 10, is remaining defiant. The group maintains that the demands expressed in the manifesto are in line with the Thai constitution and their political rights.  Thammasat is once again playing host to student activists addressing the most taboo of topics in a country that has long treated its monarchs as god-like figures. The military-backed government and pro-royalists have so far been restrained in their response to the latest challenge to the monarchy, but the dark memory of the 1976 Thammasat massacre serves as a horrific reminder of what may happen if the government and its backers are unwilling to address protesters’ demands.

(Source: zhang kaiyv on Unsplash Moving out: Samsung is considering moving some production from Vietnam (pictured) to India.(Source:  The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme was announced in April 2020, focusing on electronics.  ""A total of 22 companies have filed their applications under the PLI scheme,"" said Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad at a recent press conference.  Apple and Samsung are among the companies that have applied. Three of Apple's contract manufacturers, Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron, are also in the mix.    Movers and shakers The scheme gives an incentive of 4-6% of incremental sales over five years to electronics firms that manufacture mobile phones and other electronic components.  Under the terms of the program, firms that manufacture mobile phones with a sale price of INR15,000 ($200) or more will get an incentive of up to 6% on incremental sale.  South Korean electronics giant Samsung, which already operates its biggest manufacturing unit in India, is likely to move a part of its smartphone production from Vietnam to India.  The company plans to invest around $40 billion in the next five years under the PLI. If this comes through, it will be a major win for India since Samsung produces a significant chunk of its smartphones in Vietnam.  It's a good time for Samsung and Apple to move in, as Chinese handset makers are losing out because of growing anti-Chinese sentiment.    Making it in India India has been trying to establish itself as a manufacturing destination.  A few years back, it launched the ""Make in India"" initiative to attract international firms to manufacture in India. India wants to increase manufacturing's share of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by the year 2025 to 25%, from its current 15%.  The country had hoped to gain firms looking for alternatives to supply chains disrupted in China due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Want to know more about 5G?

First Draft recently launched a publication, Footnotes, and we’re happy to share some Footnotes and First Draft stories with Lab readers. As First Draft executive director Claire Wardle writes, “If the agents of disinformation borrow tactics and techniques from each other, which they do, then so must we.”  The surfeit of misinformation online during the pandemic has prompted some governments to implement extraordinary measures in an attempt to establish control amid the chaos. Criminalizing the dissemination of “false news,” expanding existing penalties for spreading misinformation, and increasing surveillance are among the actions some authorities have taken. Human rights and media observers warn that such remedies are worse than the problem they seek to alleviate, and that freedom of expression, privacy, and the right to protest are disintegrating under the pretext of safeguarding public health.  But governments’ concerns aren’t without reason. Over the past six months, conspiracy theories, bogus cures and partisan finger-pointing online have spilled over into real-world harm: more than 700 dead from alcohol poisoning in Iran, Muslims attacked in India, telecommunications infrastructure vandalized in the U.K., and untold numbers of people sick or dead from a virus they thought wasn’t serious. This on top of more than 700,000 deaths from Covid-19 and the gutting of economies around the globe.  Hungary, Romania, Algeria, Thailand, and the Philippines are among the countries that have instituted new laws or invoked emergency decrees giving authorities the power to block websites, issue fines, or imprison people for producing or spreading false information during the pandemic. In Cambodia and Indonesia, social media users have been arrested after allegedly posting false news about the coronavirus. In Egypt, a journalist who had been critical of the government’s response to the pandemic and was detained for “spreading fake news” contracted the virus in custody and died before he could be tried. Even in South Africa, where freedom of expression is a constitutional right, politicians criminalized the publication of any statement made “with the intention to deceive any other person” about Covid-19, government measures to address the disease or — in a sign of the country’s grim experience with HIV/AIDS — a person’s infection status.  In a March 2020 statement, United Nations human rights experts urged governments to “avoid overreach of security measures” in responding to the pandemic, and said that emergency powers should be “proportionate, necessary and non-discriminatory,” and not be used to quash dissent.  It’s an exhortation that many are not heeding.  Julie Posetti, global director of research at the International Center for Journalists, said legislation is being misused to justify crackdowns on legitimate speech in a number of countries.  “There are circumstances where journalists have been detained and fined, for example, in reference to reportage that has been critical of government and that is deemed to be ‘fake news’ because it doesn’t suit the government,” Posetti said.  But she said that even well-intentioned laws could “inadvertently catch legitimate communication in the net,” effectively criminalizing journalism and undermining fundamental rights.  Whistleblowers have also come under attack, notably the Chinese ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, who was reprimanded for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak in Wuhan before dying from Covid-19, only to receive a posthumous apology.  “If you can’t have doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers speaking publicly about failures of the system where it’s in the public interest to do so, because they’re afraid of being jailed on so-called ‘fake news’ laws because the government equates criticism with fakery, you have a really serious problem,” Posetti said.  Nani Jansen Reventlow, a human rights lawyer and founding director of the Digital Freedom Fund, said laws governing misinformation affect private individuals as much as journalists. So does increased surveillance, such as contact-tracing software.  “Using apps to track people’s movement has a chilling effect on people being able to share information because everyone knows where they’ve been,” she said.  She cited South Korea’s app as an example of a coronavirus tracker having a particularly deleterious impact on people’s privacy, with individuals able to monitor one another through technology that was found to have serious security flaws.  In addition to affecting whistleblowers and source confidentiality for journalists, increased surveillance could also affect people’s willingness to exercise their right to assemble.  “Will you actually go to a protest if you know you’re going to be monitored? That particularly applies to those of us who are in a more vulnerable position when it comes to law enforcement,” Jansen Reventlow said. “You never know how it’s going to backfire.”  4⃣Around the🌍the law is being weaponised against journalism, & governments are cracking down on whistleblowers under the cover of #COVID19. With @pressfreedom, we want to learn about the extent & costs of these incursions via media workers on the ground https://t.co/LK0nf2f1iB — Dr. Julie Posetti (@julieposetti) May 14, 2020  Internet shutdowns preceding the pandemic — such as those in Indian-administered region of Kashmir and the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh — have also impeded access to essential information about the virus and response.  Jansen Reventlow fears emergency measures that stifle civil society and press freedom, such as those implemented in Hungary, will outlast the pandemic. “There is a danger that those emergency powers will not be turned back anytime soon,” she said.  Then there’s the question of whether laws against misinformation achieve their professed purpose.  Posetti said there was a lack of empirical evidence as to whether such laws impeded the distribution of false and misleading information. “But what we can say from prior research is that these sorts of laws do, in fact, chill a broad range of public communication, and that is where the problem lies.”  It’s a concern Jansen Reventlow shares. “The only thing it’s going to do is make it easier for public authorities to clamp down on things they don’t like.”  Instead, she said, governments should consistently and proactively provide accurate, timely information about the situation and the basis for policy decisions, so that people aren’t left to speculate in a vacuum.  “It’s about finding the right balance. But a thorough debate about where that balance should be found is pretty absent at the moment,” she said."

He said of the total number of individuals detained for violating the recovery MCO, 26 had been remanded, while 91 others were slapped with compound notices.  ""Among the offences committed include failure to provide entry-exit logbook (37 cases), not wearing face mask (8), operating premises beyond permitted hours (two), involved in prostitution activities (24), and gatherings with no space to exercise social distancing,"" he said in a statement Thursday (Aug 20).  Ismail Sabri said the Covid-19 standard operating procedure (SOP) compliance taskforce headed by police had conducted 67,369 checks to gauge compliance during the recovery MCO phase.  Checks were carried out at 3,988 supermarkets, 5,731 restaurants, 1,500 hawker stalls, 1,692 factories, 3,907 banks, and 1,033 government offices.  Checks were also carried out 1,124 land transport terminals, 212 marine terminals, and 139 air transport terminals.  There were no arrests involving undocumented migrants on Wednesday.  ""The government will continue taking stern action against those crossing the border illegally,"" he said.  From July 24 to Aug 19, accommodation was provided for 14,048 individuals returning from abroad at 67 hotels and five public training institutes.  Of the total returnees, 43 were being treated at hospitals, while 6,316 had since been discharged.  They had returned from 32 countries namely the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Singapore, Vietnam, Brunei, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, India, United Arab Emirates, Japan, Turkey, South Korea, Iran, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Timor Leste, Taiwan, China, Britain, Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Egypt, Spain, France, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.  Police had on Aug 19 conducted spot checks on 380 individuals under the 14-day mandatory home quarantine order and found zero violations.  Checks carried out at 32 construction sites also showed compliance.  Since March 30, the Housing and Local Government Ministry had carried out 9,674 sanitisation operations in 134 zones involving 12,860 premises including business centres (2,699), government premises (5,659), residential areas (1,594), and supermarkets (354)."

In bordering Cambodia, where the US war has spread besides a vicious air war over Laos, millions more died, including those massacred in the Cambodian holocaust.  The letter, co-signed by other luminaries from the Vietnam antiwar movement contained 4 major bulleted points regarding the government of Vietnam: “The jails are overflowing with thousands upon thousands of “detainees,” “People disappear and never return,” “People are shipped to re-education centers, fed a starvation diet of stale rice, forced to squat bound wrist to ankle, suffocated in ‘connex’ boxes,” and “People are used as human mine detectors, clearing live mine fields with their hands and feet.”  Among those from the antiwar movement who did not sign the alleged indictment of human rights violations in Vietnam were Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, Philip Berrigan, William Kunstler, Daniel Ellsberg, and Leonard Weinglass.  The letter contained a clip and send section with appeals to the secretary general of the UN, the president of Vietnam, and Humanitas International, a group founded by Baez.  Around the time that the letter appeared in major newspapers, a debate raged among those who had opposed the war about the inferences of the letter that may have led to conclusions that supported anti-communism. The communists had been victorious in Vietnam’s civil war. I vaguely remember the controversy that the letter caused, as I was in-between having secured a discharge from the military that was granted “under honorable conditions,” and fighting the Veterans Administration for recognition of the medical and moral issues involved in my protest against the Vietnam War both in and out of the military (I would lose the latter battle as so many others would).  What I object to about the letter is that the Vietnamese people had fought a decades-long civil war that cost its people millions of deaths and millions of injuries. The communist economic system that functioned in Vietnam did have human rights violations. However, the US, the great so-called bastion of democracy, had killed millions in Southeast Asia and had its own glaring human rights issues implicit in its expansion of empire. Mass incarceration of huge segments of the US population had already begun within the globalized economy. That Vietnam had intervened in the Cambodian genocide and put an end to it seems also worthy of comment. Vietnam’s own regional interests need to be factored into that intervention.  The US involvement in Cambodia during the Vietnam War was a major factor in precipitating the instability of the government in Phnom Penh that helped set the stage for genocide. Why no celebrity letter about that human rights disaster?  Where were calls in letters from celebrities to pay reparations to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos? Where were calls to develop and implement programs to remove antipersonnel weapons such as land mines? Where were funds to help with the cleanup and effects of Agent Orange?  The point here is not to fight old and forgotten battles or criticize any group of people. Around the time of the appearance of the letter, a disagreement between Joan Baez and Jane Fonda took place, and that issue captured the interest of both the national and left press. Dissent carried a commentary about that disagreement.  Celebrity has accompanied electoral and especially presidential elections for decades. Celebrity accompanied mass “culture.” While working in the John Kerry campaign for president in 2004 in Florida, I waited in a public space in West Palm Beach for hours to hear the former senator and later secretary of state address the crowd. In the lead-up to Kerry’s appearance at the rally, actor Kirsten Dunst took the stage to support the senator.  This writing is not a criticism of those celebrities who come out for candidates, as I was at the Florida rally as a campaign worker and supporter of Kerry. I had fallen into the better than Bush scenario that always leads to the lesser of two evils choice that ends up being no choice at all because of the nearly seamless agreement between the right-wing and neoliberal strands of electoral politics in the US. Ultimately the differences among candidates are often only widow dressing for the oligarchs and plutocrats who pull and control the strings of their electoral marionettes.  I don’t know if celebrity benefits from its support of candidates, but logic points to the fact that exposure in mass culture must have some kinds of benefits. I don’t know. Perhaps there are those selfless celebrities who do it (electoral politics) because they believe in what they’re doing and want to use their celebrity toward perceived good ends.  What I know is that the Biden-Harris campaign will have a bandwagon of celebrities endorsing their campaign and appearing at campaign rallies (probably virtually because of Covid-19), etc., and we the electorate will again get candidates for office who fill the linear space between the neoliberal and extreme right wing of US politics. Ground wars have now been expanded into drone wars, proxy wars, embargoes, sanctions, and coup d’états. These nuanced wars play much better for the electorate and celebrities."

Garbade and Frank M. Keane  The 2020 Market Intervention  Origins of Federal Reserve Concern with an Orderly Treasury Market  ... it was brought out that, in addition to its operations to serve general credit policy, the Reserve System had some responsibility for the maintenance of an orderly money market, and that in recent years the government security market had become so large a part of the money market that the general responsibility for the money market involves some measure of responsibility for avoiding disorderly conditions in the government security market.  The September 1939 Intervention  The July 1958 Intervention  At the conclusion of the last Committee meeting the [Desk] was informed by several leaders in the business that there were almost no bids .... Until recently, the selling seemed to be mostly speculative-type selling. However, with prices falling and dealers withdrawing their bids, there were reports of increasing institutional selling.... Dealers were reporting that the market was tending to feed on itself.  The May 1970 Intervention  Summing Up  In response to disorderly market conditions in mid-March 2020, the Federal Reserve began an asset purchase program designed to improve market functioning in the Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets. The 2020 purchases have no parallel, but there are several instances of large SOMA purchases undertaken to support Treasury market functions in earlier decades. This post recaps three such episodes, one in 1939 at the start of World War II, one in 1958 in connection with a poorly received Treasury financing, and a third in 1970, also in connection with a Treasury financing. The three episodes, together with the more recent intervention, demonstrate the Fed’s long-standing and continuing commitment to the maintenance of orderly market functioning in markets where it conducts monetary policy operations—formerly limited to the Treasury market, but now also including the agency MBS market.The Federal Reserve’s System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings of U.S. Treasury and agency MBS expanded at an extraordinary pace beginning on March 13, 2020, with purchases totaling more than $100 billion on some days (see chart). Severe disruptions in Treasury market functioning, discussed here , and in the agency MBS market, discussed here , triggered the interventions. Cumulative purchases between March 13 and July 31 amounted to $1.77 trillion of Treasuries and $892 billion of agency MBS. The purchases were undertaken by the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, acting on instructions from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to make purchases “in the amounts needed to support [and subsequently sustain] the smooth functioning of [the Treasury and agency MBS] markets.”The manager of the Open Market Account, Lorie Logan, recently commented on the “unprecedented scale and speed” of the March purchases. Logan observed that, “in early to mid-March, amid extreme volatility across the financial system, the functioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets became severely impaired” and that “continued dysfunction would have led to an even deeper and broader seizing up of credit markets and ultimately worsened the financial hardships that many Americans have been experiencing as a result of the pandemic.” She further noted how the responsiveness of the Desk’s interventions to evolving market conditions contributed to meeting the Committee’s objectives.Whether the Federal Reserve System has some responsibility for maintaining an orderly market for U.S. Treasury securities was first discussed in the December 21, 1936, FOMC meeting, where, as recounted in the minutes of the meeting:In an April 1939 memo to the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, written in anticipation of a war in Europe, Allan Sproul, the First Vice President of the Bank and interim manager of the Open Market Account, observed that “we have an obligation ... to facilitate an orderly adjustment of [the Treasury] market to new conditions.”World War II began on Friday, September 1, 1939. The onset of war was not unanticipated—Britain had suspended gold payments a week earlier and Treasury bond prices had fallen about two points since mid-August—but nevertheless converted what had been a likely prospect into a concrete fact. Treasury bond prices fell another 4½ to 6½ points during the first three weeks of September.In an effort to buffer the price decline and maintain an orderly market, the Desk purchased $800 million of Treasury securities during the first two weeks of September. The purchase program was the largest to date, exceeding both a $157 million purchase program in the fall of 1929 and a $640 million program in the spring of 1932. The selling abated at the end of September and prices thereafter rose to the end of the year, recovering all but about a point of the losses incurred since mid-August.Following the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of March 1951, the FOMC examined how it could best move on from its wartime and post-war policy of fixing upper limits on Treasury yields ( discussed here ) and recapture control of bank reserves. In March 1953, the Committee voted to limit its operations in the Treasury market to short-term securities, except when intervention in longer-term markets was necessary to correct a disorderly market.On Thursday, July 17, 1958, Treasury officials announced an exchange offering of 1-year certificates of indebtedness to refinance $16.2 billion of maturing securities. (In an exchange offering, investors paid for new securities by tendering maturing securities on a par-for-par basis. Cash purchases were not allowed.)At midday on July 18, Robert Rouse, the manager of the System Open Market Account, received a call from Under Secretary of the Treasury Julian Baird. Prices in the Treasury market were “drifting lower,” Baird said, and “a condition was developing which the Treasury could not, in its opinion, hope to deal with.” Baird thought the problem “was a responsibility of the Federal Reserve System.”Shortly thereafter Rouse suggested, in a conference call with FOMC members, that while trading was not disorderly, the Committee should nevertheless “authorize purchases of bonds for the [Open Market] Account ... in order to steady the market.” Al Hayes, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, thought the market was pretty close to disorderly and, in view of Treasury’s concern with the “incipient failure of its financing,” backed Rouse’s recommended course of action. The minutes of the meeting state that Chairman William McChesney Martin supported Rouse’s proposal “reluctantly.” Other Committee members went along as well and the Committee authorized the purchase of up to $50 million “of government securities at the discretion of the manager of the System Open Market Account … wherever the manager deemed it appropriate in order to stabilize the market.”Barely an hour later the Committee was back in session. As recounted in the minutes of the meeting, Rouse explained that “selling in the government securities market was increasing…. Bids were disappearing and about the only bids were those put in by the Desk. Indications were that volume was getting to be considerable.” His colleague, John Larkin, elaborated on the deteriorating situation:Rouse told the Committee that “he would now have to call the market disorderly” and that the $50 million authorized earlier was no longer adequate. Watrous Irons, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, agreed that “means must be taken by the System to restore stability.” Martin proposed that the Committee give Rouse “maximum discretion to handle the situation in the way he thought best.”Following a unanimous vote to authorize “purchase for the System Open Market Account in the open market, without limitation, government securities in addition to short-term government Securities,” the Desk bought $32 million of securities before the close of trading. The intervention reversed the earlier price decline and the market closed unchanged on the day. Bankers hailed the action as “a necessary move to meet a market situation with which the Treasury was unable to cope.”Subscription books for the exchange offering opened on Monday, July 21. Although market prices were generally firm, large secondary market offerings of the maturing securities soon appeared. The sellers were turning down the opportunity to exchange the securities for the 1-year certificates that the Treasury was offering, choosing instead to reinvest in higher yielding intermediate-term issues. Attrition (from securities not tendered for exchange that would have to be redeemed with cash) seemed likely to be quite high, potentially creating a cash flow problem for the Treasury.During an 11 a.m. FOMC conference call, Larkin pointed out that “the situation was not one which would encourage the exchange of maturing securities.” Relying on the Committee’s Friday authorization, he said the Desk intended to support the Treasury offering, fearing that the refunding “could turn out to be the worst failure in the history of Treasury financing.”The Desk began buying certificates on a when-issued basis on Monday afternoon when, in Larkin’s estimation, “the atmosphere got worse.” By the time the Committee met by telephone at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, the Desk had purchased more than $78 million of the certificates. Purchases exceeded $100 million before the meeting was over and exceeded $500 million on the day.The Desk continued buying through Wednesday, July 23, the last day the subscription books were open. By the end of the day the Desk had bought, in aggregate, more than $1 billion of the certificates, $110 million of the maturing securities, and $65 million of other notes and bonds.On Wednesday, April 29, 1970, Paul Volcker, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, announced the terms of the May refunding: a fixed-price cash subscription offering of $3.5 billion of 18-month notes and an exchange offering of 3-year and 6¾-year notes for $16.6 billion of maturing securities. Subscription books for the cash offering would be open for one day only, on Tuesday, May 5. The books for the exchange offering were set to close on May 6.In a televised speech to the nation on April 30, President Richard Nixon announced that ground combat forces had crossed over from South Vietnam into Cambodia in a large-scale operation aimed at eliminating Communist sanctuaries. By Monday, May 4, anti-war protests had erupted at dozens of colleges, four students had been killed by National Guard troops at Kent State University in Ohio, and (in the words of the Wall Street Journal) “the bond markets were battered.” Treasury yields were 25 basis points higher and the refunding was in danger of failing.On Tuesday, May 5, the Desk entered the market, buying what was described by the Wall Street Journal as “large quantities” of Treasury bills. The New York Times reported that “the Federal Reserve System was forced to make ‘massive’ purchases of securities in the open market to prevent the Treasury’s $3.5 billion sale of notes … from failing ….” The Desk purchased $1.5 billion of Treasury bills during the week ended May 6 and lent $1.2 billion on repurchase agreements.The magnitude of the Desk’s purchase program in 2020 “to support the smooth functioning” of the Treasury and agency MBS markets marked those purchases as highly unusual. From an operational perspective the speed and size of the program were unprecedented, yet as a policy response, as the three episodes discussed here show, it was not unique. There may be other ways to forestall or mitigate the appearance of a disorderly, illiquid market, such as primary market auction sales of Treasury debt (which in the 1970s replaced the fixed-price offerings at the root of the 1958 and 1970 episodes) or improved clearing and settlement systems (which have been suggested in the wake of the 2020 purchase program), but the infrequency of Federal Reserve intervention suggests that relying on the Fed on those rare occasions when markets are in extremis has not materially exacerbated moral hazard.Expanded and footnoted versions of the three episodes recounted in this Liberty Street Economics post will appear in ""After the Accord: A History of Federal Reserve Open Market Operations, the U.S. Government Securities Market, and Treasury Debt Management from 1951 to 1979,"" by Kenneth D. Garbade, to be published by Cambridge University Press next winter."

Years later, the general manager for ride-hailing firm TADA in Southeast Asia still remembers, with great fondness, those trips his mother used to take.  Advertisement  Advertisement  He wants to bring that sense of nostalgia to shoppers today through TADA's latest product - a wet market delivery service.  “I remember (when I was young) my mother would always say that, 'Oh, I'm going to Tekka Market just to specifically buy lamb',"" said Mr Chua.  ""Wet markets have this sense of nostalgia,"" he said, adding that they can also offer more competitive prices and fresher produce.  Similar to the online grocery shopping experience offered by the likes of RedMart or FairPrice, TADA Fresh Market aims to act as an “online multi-wet market shopping platform”, delivering fresh vegetables, fruit, seafood, meat and poultry from 36 stalls at Tekka and Tiong Bahru markets.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Shoppers need to place an order of at least S$30 worth of groceries to shop on the TADA Fresh Market website, with free deliveries for orders above S$50.  BOOSTING INCOME FOR DRIVERS AND STALLHOLDERS  TADA Fresh Market was identified as a delivery partner for Tekka Online Market by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), which is seeking to digitalise the wet market industry.  Advertisement  The new delivery platform is also an additional source of income for TADA's private-hire drivers, whose livelihoods have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions to curb the spread of the outbreak.  With more people working from home and limiting their social outings, the company explored “different ways and ideas” on how drivers could be supported during the pandemic, said Mr Chua.  “It's not possible to bring them back to the days where they can do 20 jobs (a day), just by the nature of the pandemic,” he said.  Noting TADA had already launched a delivery service in Cambodia, Mr Chua said TADA Fresh Market was a way of using its technology and driver network in Singapore to bring wet markets online and provide drivers with an expanded customer base.  Mr Seeni Mohammed, who sells lamb and mutton at the Tekka wet market, is one of 36 vendors selling groceries under the TADA Fresh Market platform. (Photo: TADA)  Such a delivery service also provides an additional revenue stream for stallholders during the ongoing pandemic, said Mr Chua.  Earlier this year, then-Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan announced that taxi and private-hire car drivers would be allowed to perform food and grocery deliveries until the end of September, as part of efforts to help supplement drivers’ incomes while also meeting the higher demand for home deliveries.  Since its soft launch during the ""circuit breaker"", TADA Fresh Market has acquired about 3,000 customers, who are served by about 100 drivers, said Mr Chua.  These customers use the TADA Fresh Market website to shop for their groceries at least once every two weeks, he said.  TADA works directly with wet market stall owners. Orders are consolidated late at night each day and sent to the wet market merchants for preparation. TADA drivers are then dispatched to fulfil the deliveries.  The orders are sent to the merchants via WhatsApp messages, said Mr Chua, as this is the form of technology that most of them are familiar with.  TADA does not charge merchants a commission for orders; instead, the company adds a “small markup” on the products. These markups are clearly visibly to customers on the website, said Mr Chua.  While TADA currently works primarily with stall owners at Tekka and Tiong Bahru markets, it will be expanding to include several merchants from the wet market at Block 216 Bedok North Street 1 within the next two weeks.  Mr Chua said TADA aims to bring in more wet markets in the Bedok area by the end of the year. It also aims to focus on the smaller, less well-known markets outside of central Singapore.  While there are other wet market merchants who have gone online, Mr Chua believes offering consumers a one-stop platform to buy from multiple vendors across different markets, as well as “trusted, reliable service” will help differentiate TADA Fresh Market from other players.  He adds that there are no plans to compete with the likes of Foodpanda or GrabFood in food delivery, although users can also use its platform to order small food items such as kueh and dumplings from the Tiong Bahru market.  Mr Chua said that while he is aware that online shopping will not be able to completely recreate the wet market experience for shoppers who are accustomed to seeing and touching the produce and interacting with stallholders, he hopes that TADA Fresh Market will spur younger shoppers to purchase from wet markets and keep the industry alive.  “If we can present the benefits of the products of the market conveniently to the users, I believe that a proposition (of buying groceries from the wet market) will be a long-term one,” he said.  TADA currently operates in Singapore, Vietnam and Cambodia. Earlier this month TADA’s parent company MVL announced it had raised US$5 million in funding, which it said would help in its plans to manufacture electric tuktuks for the Southeast Asian market."

What are your views on the same? Discuss.  भारत की अफ्रीका नीति का सामान्य चलन क्या रहा है? उसी पर आपके क्या विचार हैं? चर्चा करें।  Demand of the question:  It expects candidates to observe and write the general trend of India’s Africa policy. It also expects to express your views on it.  Introduction:  Africa is world’s second largest continent both in terms of land and population with 55 countries which account for about 15 percent of world’s population. India and Africa have a long and rich history of interaction marked by cultural, economic and political exchanges based on the principle of south cooperation.  Body:  In the recent years a number of steps have been taken to further strengthen these relations. Speaking at the Valedictory session of the national conference on India Africa Relations in changing global order India’s Vice President has said that India and Africa have a lot of common interests and both have vital stakes in each other’s progress, peace and prosperity.  Political and Economic Engagement: In the last few years, Africa has been the focus of India’s development assistance and also diplomatic outreach, as evident in plans to open 18 new embassies.  Also, India-Africa trade reached $62 billion in 2018 compared to $39 billion during 2009-10. India’s duty-free tariff preferential scheme for Least Developed Nation (LDCs) launched in 2008 has benefited 33 African states.  Grants in Aid: After South Asia, Africa is the second-largest recipient of Indian overseas assistance with Lines of Credit (LOC) worth nearly $10 billion (nearly 40% of the total LOC globally) spread over 100 projects in 41 countries.  Capacity Building via E-governance Initiative: India is investing in the capacity building providing more than $1 billion in technical assistance and training to personnel under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) program.  India has also invested $100 million in the Pan-African E-Network to bridge the digital divide in Africa, leveraging its strengths in information technology.  Security Cooperation: Approximately 6,000 Indian soldiers are deployed in UN peace-keeping missions in conflict zones in Africa.  Cooperation on Multiple Fronts: Bilateral cooperation includes solar energy (Cooperation in International Solar Alliance) development, information technology, cybersecurity, maritime security, disaster relief, counter-terrorism and military training.  Support in Fight Against Covid-19: Under the e-ITEC initiative, India has shared Covid-19 management strategies, training webinars exclusively aimed at training health-care professionals from Africa by Indian health experts.  Hence, on general trend if we see India’s Africa policy restricted to traditional sectors of investments and is more of helping in nature. Though the investment is made in the African countries, this investment has resulted as beneficial for both countries.  Views on the India’s Africa Policy:  India’s Africa policy over the past few decades has oscillated between passive and reluctantly reactive at best. Strategic apathy toward the continent was obvious on many fronts.  Most of the countries in Africa did not feature in India’s larger foreign policy matrix, but until recently there wasn’t any significant attention paid to the continent.  Indian leaders seldom travelled to African nations.  The narrative of India’s contemporary relationship with Africa is dominated by the historicity of their interactions. The century old trade partnerships, socio-cultural linkages built by a thriving diasporas, nationalist movements during the Nehruvian era that supported anti-imperial struggles, and shifting geopolitical tides with the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM).  Beyond this rhetoric, what kept driving this relationship forward was the acquisition of critical assets by State Owned Enterprises (SOE) looking to diversify the energy basket away from West Asian nations and other commercial ventures by Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) and Multi-National Companies (MNC).  However, some changes also have been observed in the recent years as follows:  Currently, India’s forte in the continent has been developmental initiatives such as Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC), Team 9, and Pan Africa e-network among others are aimed at building institutional and human capacity as well as enabling skills and knowledge transfer.  Conscious attempt at evoking morality to reflect an “alternate model of development” by using terms such as “win-win cooperation” to describe New Delhi’s approach to Africa.  A unique factor that sets Indian interactions apart is that there is palpable goodwill for people of Indian origin, a sense of familiarity and cultural connection, with Bollywood movies and songs often acting as a bridge.  Whereas India’s policy has focused on job creation in the countries it has invested in, China has tended to bring in its own labour causing resentment among the locals.  The Chinese model has often been criticised for creating huge debts for the nation in which it sets up projects, the Nairobi-Mombasa rail link being one example of this.  Conclusion:  India will need to start delivering on the ground if the India-Africa partnership has to move beyond high level visits. Hence, Indian investments in Africa need to expand and diversify towards ‘broad’ range and not remain restricted to traditional sectors of investments. In order to keep the momentum of building political and economic ties with this increasingly important region, steps should be taken towards tailoring and funding joint projects for the sustainable development of the Africa.  2. What are India’s economic and strategic interests in the ASEAN? Has India been able to tap the potential that Indo-ASEAN engagement offers? Critically comment.  आसियान में भारत के आर्थिक और सामरिक हित क्या हैं? क्या भारत उस क्षमता का दोहन करने में सक्षम है, जो भारत–आसियान जुड़ाव प्रदान करता है? समालोचनात्मक टिप्पणी करें।  Demand of the question:  It expects candidates to write about India’s economic and strategic interest in ASEAN. It also expects to write about whether India is successful in tapping the potential that Indo-ASEAN offers or not.  Introduction:  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is a regional organization which was established to promote political and social stability amid rising tensions among the Asia-Pacific’s post-colonial states. ASEAN works with motto of “One Vision, One Identity, One Community”.  Body:  Economic and strategic interests of India in the ASEAN:  3 Cs–Culture, Connectivity and Commerce– will shape India’s ties with the ASEAN bloc. India’s trade with ASEAN stands at approx. 10.6% of India’s overall trade.  ASEAN is India’s fourth largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between ASEAN and India has crossed US$ 80 billion mark.  Singapore has become India’s investment and trading hub in the East.  ASEAN occupies a central place in the security architecture of the Indo-Pacific region due to Maritime cooperation in terms of connectivity, safety and security.  India’s export to ASEAN stands at 11.28% of our total exports. The ASEAN-India Free Trade Area has been completed.  India and ASEAN can collaborate to combat terror financing, cyber security threats, tax evasions and many more.  India needs ASEAN support in achieving a rules-based regional security architecture. Partnership with ASEAN nations might help India counter the growing presence of China.  ASEAN is seen as the most successful regional organisation next only to the EU. ASEAN India-Business Council (AIBC) was set up in 2003 to bring key private sector players from India and the ASEAN countries on a single platform.  To develop connectivity through water, ASEAN and India are working on the Kaladan MultiModal Transit Transport Project. ASEAN-India cooperation in maritime domain is one of the key focus areas for growth and development of the Indo-Pacific region.  Under New Delhi’s ‘Act East Policy’, India has been increasing its engagements with the ASEAN.  Delhi Declaration: To identify Cooperation in the Maritime Domain as the key area of cooperation under the ASEAN-India strategic partnership.  Potential of Indo-ASEAN relations and India’s performance:  ASEAN commands far greater influence on Asia-Pacific trade, political, and security issues than its members could achieve individually.  It constitutes 3rd largest population in the world, of which more than half is below thirty years of age. It is also the Fourth most popular investment destination globally.  ASEAN’s share of global exports has also risen, from only 2 percent in 1967 to 7 percent by 2016, indicating the rising importance of trade to ASEAN’s economic prospects.  Hence, ASEAN has tremendous potential in terms of economic and strategic partnerships. However, India’s performance is of complex nature when it comes to tap potential of ASEAN:  One major reason, among many, is a lack of agreement over product standardisation between India and most other countries in Asia.  Exporters many times complain they are not able to sell, as their products do not meet the required quality standards required in a foreign land.  At a time when the world economy is doing well, it is ironic that India’s trade deficit has widened to $14.88 billion in December 2017 from $10.55 billion a year earlier.  Between 2008 and 2016, India’s trade with ASEAN region has increased faster than two of its two largest trading partners, namely, European Union and the United States  Two way trade between India and ASEAN has moved from $65.1 billion in 2015-2016 to $71.6 billion 2016-2017. However, this figure is meagre in comparison to China’s $452.3 billion in 2016.  Interestingly, in spite of all non-tariff measures and higher tariffs directed against Chinese exports, the country’s trade with ASEAN has flourished. Over the last 15 years, China has emerged as first or second largest trading partner with almost all Southeast Asian countries.  Following steps are needed to be taken to improve relations with ASEAN countries:  First, as cost of production is lower in Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar, it means that Indian firms can gain significantly by investing in these countries.  Investing in these regions meant a bigger market for Indian firms. ASEAN region has a combined GDP of $2.7 trillion.  Indian firms can evade protectionist measures targeted against their exports if they start exporting from ASEAN region.  Investing in these regions will also ease out some of India’s energy requirements, enabling the Indian to access cheaper foreign energy (oil and power) and minerals from Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam.  Participating in the South-east Asian production network will allow India to increase its manufacturing base besides creating jobs for its young population.  Also we need to open dialogue with ASEAN countries to modify the terms of Regional Comprehensive Economic Framework in such a way that it should not harm India’s economy much, as India stood away from RCEP citing this reason.  Conclusion:  ASEAN region due to its demographic dividend advantage, technological advancement and wide market economy hold immense potential for growth and development of Indian sectors of economy such as horticulture, dairy etc. Hence, it’s a great opportunity for India to mingle its objectives of Make in India with needs of economies in the ASEAN region, which will ensure a greater growth for Indian economy and creation of more jobs in India.  3. With many global powers getting disillusioned with the Chinese promise, India has a golden window of opportunity to become the global manufacturing hub. Comment.  कई वैश्विक शक्तियों के चीनी वादे से मोहभंग होने के कारण, भारत के पास वैश्विक विनिर्माण केंद्र बनने के अवसर की एक सुनहरी खिड़की है। टिप्पणी करें।  Demand of the question:  It expects candidates to write about how global powers are getting disillusioned with Chinese promise and put forward both sides views that whether it’s a golden window of opportunity for India to become the global manufacturing hub.  Introduction:  As tensions between India and China over the Indo-Chinese border grow, Indian government has come up with a strategy for self-reliance. Boycotting Chinese products, shifting towards local products is an essential component of that strategy. Replacing Chinese imports with the Indian home brands and gradually replace China as a global manufacturing hub in the post-COVID-19 world.  Body:  Disillusionment of global powers with China:  The whole world is currently reeling from the effects of the recent novel coronavirus pandemic.  It is now a well-known fact that the coronavirus pandemic has dealt a big blow to the credibility of China. Due to its hiding of data regarding Coronavirus pandemic.  China has been one of the biggest retailers in the world but the situation has changed today due to the visible denial of the shipment entry to the ports of the US.  China’s sustained selling position in the global market is due to its lower prices and larger volumes; however, this position is expected to change depending upon the relations of China with the US and other advanced economies in the post-COVID 19 phase.  According to the ‘US- India Strategic and Partnership Forum’, around 200 of American firms have thought of shifting their manufacturing from China to India. For instance, US firms like Mastercard may shift its base from China to Uttar Pradesh (India), as UP is claimed to be the hub of ‘90 lakh MSMEs and skilled labor’.  Hence, it opens up a golden window of opportunity for India to become a global manufacturing hub in following ways:  Creating alternate source of manufacturing is a difficult challenge but small but systematic steps in that direction can help it to become self-reliant under the proposed ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ project. ‘Make in India’ schemes for promoting manufacturing of products in India shall in the short run result the replacement of production of low technology goods from China to India thereby encouraging production of local goods at a much lower price.  This could be possible due to the announcement of the comprehensive Rs. 20 lakh crore relief and reboot economy package which would result in huge relief in taxation for small businesses.  This will provide an incentive for the domestic manufacturing of products. This package will be particularly helpful for the MSMEs in carrying out their operations because of the collateral-free assistance worth Rs. 3 lack crore that is being provided.  There is a huge opportunity for India in the electronic segment including export base. The China smartphone market overtook the US market to become the second-largest smartphone market with the growth of 7 per cent.  According to ICEA, the Indian position in terms of electronic exports has remained flat with staying at $5 billion. A new scheme to promote electronic manufacturing, and have a worth of Rs 48,000 crore, will help India utilise the opportunity and make India a desirable alternative to China.  Although many global manufacturers are moving out of China, their relocation to India is dependent upon the increased capacity of India in terms of manufacturing. Electric two-wheelers, e-rickshaws run from lithium-ion batteries that are imported from China.  India succeeded in convincing Suzuki for establishing a factory of lithium-ion batteries in Gujarat. In a similar manner it needs to convince Hyundai, Panasonic, and LG for the investment plans in India in terms of the lithium-ion batteries.  However, there are some structural and infrastructural challenges which exist in the way to boost the manufacturing sector in India:  While a massive working-age population gives India the chance to become the world’s next growth titan, the country will have to work hard to translate its demographic windfall into much higher standards of living for average Indians. Economic productivity is the key.  China has been built on infrastructure, investment and manufacturing; India has barely scratched the surface on all three.  Today, India lags far behind China on all three fronts. India invests about 30 percent of its GDP, compared with about 50 percent in China. Manufacturing is about 20 percent of the Indian economy; it is about 30 percent of China’s.  China has arguably the best physical infrastructure outside the Western world. India’s looks more like the poor country that it still is.  Indian democracy is beyond vibrant, whereas China remains a one party state. For instance, When the Chinese government wants to build a high-speed rail line, they just acquire the land and move and compensate the adversely affected people.  However, acquisition of land and building of project with this much of speed is less likely to happen in India.  The manufacturing capabilities of South Asian countries also pose a challenge for India to expand its market. e.g. Vietnam:, The biggest factors contributing to the Vietnam’s development is proximity to China, availability of cheap labour and its business friendly policies.  The government can replicate best practices from the South Asian countries to improve India’s ranking on competitiveness. Incentives for export of electronic goods will also help. There is a need to push through long-pending legislation that aims to address the structural bottlenecks (in 4Ls: Land, Labour, Law, Liquidity) that continue to plague and hinder domestic competitiveness.  Conclusion:  India’s strategy should be to boost manufacturing competitiveness and increase its share in world trade. In this pursuit, there is a need to create an infrastructure that raises the competitiveness of India’s exports. Hence, the coronavirus pandemic and trade war between USA and China has opened up a golden window of opportunity for India to be the manufacturing hub of the world.  TLP HOT Synopsis_DAY_61 PDF"

Authorities have… [+4373 chars]","Advertising Read more  Bangkok (AFP)  A pro-democracy movement led by student groups is gathering steam across Thailand, with some activists even calling for reform of the kingdom's unassailable monarchy.  Authorities have so far made 11 arrests on various charges, including sedition and breaking coronavirus rules, before releasing them on bail.  Here is what we know so far:  - What do the protesters want? -  The protesters are rallying against the government of Premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha.  The former army chief led a coup in 2014 and kept the kingdom under military rule for five years.  Under the junta, a new constitution was drafted before elections were held last year.  Prayut was voted in to lead a civilian government -- a win analysts say was tilted by the new charter's provisions.  Protesters say the whole process was a stitch-up and are calling for parliament to be dissolved, the constitution rewritten and an end to the harassment they are facing.  They also have a list of 10 demands for the monarchy, including throwing out a defamation law that shields the powerful royal family from criticism.  The law is one of the harshest in the world, carrying a jail sentence of up to 15 years per charge.  - Why now? -  Discontent has been simmering since February when the leaders of an opposition party, popular among young people, were banned from politics.  Many protesters say the move against the Future Forward Party was politically motivated.  A pandemic lockdown, which sent Thailand's economy into freefall, exposed the chasms between the billionaire class and the poor.  In June, prominent activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit, who had been living in self-exile in neighbouring Cambodia, then disappeared.  Thailand's social media-savvy activists lit up Twitter with their demands for answers.  The online campaign spilled offline mid-July and the wave of protests across the country started, with up to 20,000 turning out at the biggest rally so far last weekend.  - We've seen Thai protests before. What's different? -  True, Thailand has seen a spin-cycle of violent street protests and military coups over the decades.  But in the past the protest movements had vast financial and political clout behind them.  Today's student demonstrators say there is no single leader -- a strategy partly inspired by the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests.  Daring to take on the taboo topic of the country's monarchy is also a first.  Under the constitution, the royals -- including the super-rich King Maha Vajiralongkorn -- are supposed to stay out of politics, but they wield enormous clout.  Since the king took the throne in 2016, he has made unprecedented changes, taking direct control of the palace's fortune and moving two army units under his command.  At his side are the arch-royalist military and powerful billionaire clans.  - What's the reaction? -  Mixed.  The student-led protests have drawn support from a broad demographic, including many from the country's working classes.  The movement has also spread to high schools across the country with teenagers tying white bows of solidarity in their hair and on backpacks.  But pro-royalist groups are enraged and have held their own, smaller counter-demonstrations with mostly older protesters carrying signs like, ""Don't touch the monarchy"".  Army chief Apirat Kongsompong has ominously warned that ""hatred of the nation"" is an incurable disease.  Prayut last week branded the protest demands as ""unacceptable"" to most Thais but later struck a more conciliatory note by calling for unity.  - What comes next? -  Hard to predict.  By tackling the monarchy, Paul Chambers of Naresuan University says the protesters have ""effectively forced the genie out of the bottle"".  Historians -- and even the student leaders themselves -- have raised the spectre of a previous student-led movement.

The hearing opened with a moment of silence for those who had lost their lives in the tragic blast.  As the judges delivered their findings, lawyers and court officials wore face masks, and plastic screens separated people in the courtroom as they sat distanced from one another, a sign of the times in which we live.  PODCAST: Inside Israel's no-change, no-cost peace deal with the UAE 0:00 -- : -- 15 Skip 15 seconds backwards Play audio 15 Skip 15 seconds ahead 1 X Change playback rate from 1 to 1 Mute audio  The Ayyash trial – the most significant and high-profile of the cases being examined by the Tribunal – began six years ago and sought to apportion accountability for the assassination of Rafik Hariri in downtown Beirut 15 years ago.  As the judgment was delivered and the judges described what happened on the day his father was assassinated, Saad Hariri’s eyes remained fixed on the table in front of him, his face unmoving. Saad Hariri, who resigned from his position as prime minister in October 2019, amid allegations of corruption and outrage by the Lebanese people, sat beside other victims who were also irrevocably affected on that day.  Some two years after the assassination, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1757 paved the way for the establishment of a Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which would sit in Leidschendam, The Netherlands, and would prosecute those responsible. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon is an international body, with Lebanese and international judges. While the Tribunal is not part of the Lebanese judicial system it does prosecute individuals using Lebanese criminal law.  The four men on trial – Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hassan Habib Merhi, Hussein Hassan Oneissi and Assad Hassan Sabra – are all Lebanese-born and all have links to Hezbollah, a political and military entity based in Lebanon, with ties to Syria and Iran. Ayyash was accused of orchestrating and carrying out the attack, and faced charges of committing a terrorist act by means of an explosive device, intentional homicide and attempted intentional homicide. The others were charged as accomplices.  The alleged mastermind of the group, Mustafa Badreddine, was originally indicted by the Tribunal but it is believed he died in a mysterious explosion near the Damascus International Airport in 2016. Hezbollah, along with Syria, has denied involvement in the assassination. This makes the Special Tribunal for Lebanon the first of its kind to prosecute terrorism as a distinct crime.  On Tuesday, Ayyash was found guilty on all counts for his role in the assassination. All of the other defendants were acquitted.  The presiding judge in the Ayyash case said that there is no evidence that Hezbollah’s leadership or Syria were connected to the attack. Given that Ayyash was affiliated with Hezbollah, this is a particularly interesting finding and one which raised many eyebrows in Lebanon. Nonetheless, given Ayyash’s known affiliation to Hezbollah, the Tribunal is implicating Hezbollah indirectly by finding him guilty. Saad Hariri has requested that Hezbollah hand over Ayyash, however this is unlikely given that Hezbollah has rejected both the Tribunal and any judgment it delivers.  The defendants were tried in absentia; they were not in the custody of the court and have not taken part in the trial. Their current location is unknown and it is not even clear if they are still alive. To try a person in absentia is not unheard of in certain legal systems. While some argue that such trials are acceptable in exceptional circumstances, in the context of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which is a temporary court, in absentia trials are particularly problematic. Indeed, I would argue that they infringe on the defendants’ right to a fair trial and could even be argued to violate international human rights law.  The Special Tribunal for Lebanon's ruling in the Ayyash et al. case Credit: STL / YouTube  Even though the accused can request a retrial if they surface at some point in the future, to hold a trial in absentia is still a highly questionable move by an international court in its pursuit of justice and it sets an unfortunate precedent. Justice is important, but not at the expense of a fair trial. There is something very uncomfortable about watching an international court deliver judgment in a trial that has not had the involvement of the accused.  Aside from the controversy of holding an international trial in absentia, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon has been highly criticized for its astronomical cost – $1 billion dollars – the protracted proceedings, as well as its selective and very narrow mandate. Half of the Tribunal’s funding came from Lebanon. While the Lebanese people starve, and the country suffers economic decline, the Tribunal’s high cost is difficult to justify.  In delivering its judgment, the Tribunal noted the devastating impact on the victims – those who lost family members and those who suffered catastrophic injuries. Many have permanent injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. Those victims who have spoken out have noted the value of the Tribunal, but this is largely symbolic rather than providing genuine accountability. If anything, the judgment means that there is less incentive for states to find Ayyash.  Despite protestations of this judgment being “justice for Lebanon,” it is unlikely to help Lebanon itself. The judgment may actually inflame tensions in the country, particularly between Hariri and Hezbollah supporters; it may also escalate the economic, political and social crisis that is unfolding.  It is also uncertain whether remote justice delivered in The Netherlands, far from Lebanon and without the presence of any of the accused, is actually justice, or rather merely expensive symbolism. The Tribunal’s judgment is a small part of what is needed for justice in Lebanon in all of its manifestations, particularly given the protracted civil war, numerous political assassinations which have been perpetrated with impunity and the recent massive explosion. The Hariri assassination is but one tragic event alongside many others that need a legitimate justice response.  Whether or not the Tribunal provided justice for Lebanon, as it claims, only the Lebanese people and the victims can judge. It certainly does not feel like justice.

It seems like a lifetime ago now when there was so much uncertainty. As we talked to local drivers and tour guides, they talked about this potential threat. As a driver took us to the airport through the teeming streets of Siem Reap, Cambodia, to the outskirts where it seemed the hotels just stopped, he spoke about what it could do to his livelihood if tourism was affected.  In May, I saw an article on the elephants in Thailand returning to their homes from tourist camps with no visitors. Without tourists, the locals are suffering and do not have the money to pay for the land, the food, and the salaries of those who work there.  Don’t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free  Elephants Brought us to Laos  We visited one such elephant camps in Laos. It was one of the reasons we visited the region. They are a vital – and tricky – part of the culture of Thailand and Laos, once known as Land of a Million Elephants or Lan Xang. There are only about 800 Asian elephants left. About half live in the wild and half are kept by humans. Some are used for logging and others are used for tourism. Both can be hard on the elephants.  We had seen contestants of The Amazing Race riding elephants in Laos. It looked amazing and my husband tapped on his phone and within minutes found the location.  “They are sending me a coupon for 20 percent off,” he said.  Within months we had booked our trip to Luang Prabang, Laos. But as we learned more about the place and its people, we realized we didn’t want to take part in riding the elephants.  Researching Ethical Elephant Tourism  As we had watched the contestants riding the elephants we assumed it was ethical, since it looked more humane than other methods, where elephants were fit with giant “howdah” chairs, but as we researched more, I just didn’t feel comfortable riding elephants even bareback.  Often elephants are beaten into submission or chained in order to get to the point where they would allow a human to ride them. And, even though they are large animals, supporting humans, with or without a howdah on their back is painful.  I began to search for a place where we could spend time with elephants without compromising our integrity.  Where Conservation is More Than a Catchphrase  Though a lot of the tourist spots used the word “sanctuary” or “ecological”, Mandalao Elephant Conservation provides refuge to elephants and does not use the word conservation lightly. Elephants there have been rescued from other tourist facilities or logging camps.  Here they roam free and do only what elephants do naturally. That is eat, play, walk, and poop, according to our guide. Any tourist interaction here is centered around the elephant and what the things they need to do to maintain a healthy weight. We signed up for the Communicating with Elephants tour, which was described as feeding snacks to the elephants and then walking with them through the jungle. I knew I was doing the right thing by not riding the elephants, but I was a little afraid I would have minimal time with the elephants. I was so wrong about that!  Up Close and Personal with the Elephants  Mandalao, is about a half-hour away from where we were staying in Luang Prabang, on the banks of the Nam Kahn river. On the way there we were filled in on what was to come and many facts about the elephants. It was clear how much our local guide knew and loved these animals. On our tour, there was only one other couple from France and the four of us first sat down with the Project Director, Prasop Tippraser.  He was a founder of the Thai Elephant Conservation Center and an expert who told us about the work they do and his work with elephants for 30 years. He created the center’s positive reinforcement training which uses no hooks or tools to make elephants respond, just bananas. Later we noticed one of the elephants we met had a scar from a bullhook at another camp, a hole in one of her ears.  Don’t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free  We next made banana treats for the elephants, combining sticky rice, tamarind, and salt and inserting into a baby banana before heading across the river to where the elephants live chain-free. When we arrived, two female elephants, Mae Tu and Mae Mahn, who would be our companions for the afternoon were bathing in the river.  After they joined us up on the banks, behind only a tiny wooden fence, we fed them bananas from the basket we brought over with us. They grabbed them with their trunks like muscular little fingers and it was like nothing I had ever experience before. They ate and ate and ate until there were no more. Then, the fun continued as we walked with them through the woods for another 45 minutes or so.  As they walked, they explored, stopping, grabbing at branches, and dusting their wet bodies with dirt. And we were right there with them. Any concerns I had about not spending enough time with them was definitely not warranted. We had so much time with them, we hugged and kissed them, and it was definitely an experience I will never forget.  Don’t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free  Tourism is Struggling  As with the elephants in Thailand, the tourists at Mandalao have stopped coming. They have decided to keep their elephants and have received some grants, but need help to support the elephants and the mahouts that work with them. It costs about $500 a month to feed one elephant, and they have 13 elephants, a total of $6,500 a month. As such, they have started a Go Fund Me campaign.

Indian exporters and their counterparts from Laos will discuss opportunities for increasing trade and investment between the two countries at a video conference organised by the Indian Embassy in Lao PDR, in association with exporters’ body FIEO, this week, an official told BusinessLine.  Building on potential  The MEA has started the exercise of roping in its consulates world over to help push India’s exports wherever possible with the objective of not only increasing but diversifying trade.  “India and Laos have shared friendly relations for the past many decades and have been reliable trade partners. However, India’s share in Laos’ imports is still very small and much below China’s. There is a lot of potential for increase and the effort of the government will be to build on the existing potential,” the official said.  India’s total trade with Laos reached $28.18 million in 2019-20 out of which exports were worth $ 25 million. The country’s export to Laos was small compared to China’s exports worth $1.7 billion.  “Due to the pandemic and the strained relations between China and many of its trading partners, a shift in supply chains is likely to happen. This is the right time for Indian exporters to push in markets where their presence is low,” the official said.  CLMV corridor  Electrical machinery and equipment, pharmaceuticals, vehicles, ceramics and organic chemicals are a few of the main products exported from India to Lao PDR.  The objective of the video conference is to understand the present status of economic situation in Lao PDR in view of Covid-19 and formulate roadmap/strategies that need to be followed to enhance India’s share in Lao PDR imports, according to FIEO.  Senior officials from Lao National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LNCCI) and the Ministry of Commerce have been invited to join the session, the official said.  Laos is not only important for India in terms of being a market for goods, but also for investments. In fact, the Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam (CLMV) corridor is one of the fastest-growing sub-regions within the ASEAN and India also has plans to promote investments in the four countries which could serve as a gateway for it to the rest of South Asia."

We aimed to develop and test a human model of artemisinin-resistant (ART-R) Plasmodium falciparum to evaluate the efficacy of drugs against ART-R malaria. Methods and findings We conducted 2 sequential phase 1, single-centre, open-label clinical trials at Q-Pharm, Brisbane, Australia, using the induced blood-stage malaria (IBSM) model, whereby healthy participants are intravenously inoculated with blood-stage parasites. In a pilot study, participants were inoculated (Day 0) with approximately 2,800 viable P. falciparum ART-R parasites. In a comparative study, participants were randomised to receive approximately 2,800 viable P. falciparum ART-R (Day 0) or artemisinin-sensitive (ART-S) parasites (Day 1). In both studies, participants were administered a single approximately 2 mg/kg oral dose of artesunate (AS; Day 9). Primary outcomes were safety, ART-R parasite infectivity, and parasite clearance. In the pilot study, 2 participants were enrolled between April 27, 2017, and September 12, 2017, and included in final analyses (males n = 2 [100%], mean age = 26 years [range, 23–28 years]). In the comparative study, 25 participants were enrolled between October 26, 2017, and October 18, 2018, of whom 22 were inoculated and included in final analyses (ART-R infected participants: males n = 7 [53.8%], median age = 22 years [range, 18–40 years]; ART-S infected participants: males n = 5 [55.6%], median age = 28 years [range, 22–35 years]). In both studies, all participants inoculated with ART-R parasites became parasitaemic. A total of 36 adverse events were reported in the pilot study and 277 in the comparative study. Common adverse events in both studies included headache, pyrexia, myalgia, nausea, and chills; none were serious. Seven participants experienced transient severe falls in white cell counts and/or elevations in liver transaminase levels which were considered related to malaria. Additionally, 2 participants developed ventricular extrasystoles that were attributed to unmasking of a predisposition to benign fever-induced tachyarrhythmia. In the comparative study, parasite clearance half-life after AS was significantly longer for ART-R infected participants (n = 13, 6.5 hours; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3–6.7 hours) compared with ART-S infected participants (n = 9, 3.2 hours; 95% CI 3.0–3.3 hours; p < 0.001). The main limitation of this study was that the ART-R and ART-S parasite strains did not share the same genetic background. Conclusions We developed the first (to our knowledge) human model of ART-R malaria. The delayed clearance profile of ART-R parasites after AS aligns with field study observations. Although based on a relatively small sample size, results indicate that this model can be safely used to assess new drugs against ART-R P. falciparum. Trial registration The studies were registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12617000244303 (https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=372357) and ACTRN12617001394336 (https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=373637).  Author summary Why was this study done? Malaria resistance to artemisinin combination therapies is spreading in the Greater Mekong subregion; therefore, new antimalarial drugs are needed to control malaria.  Malaria volunteer infection studies (VIS), in which healthy volunteers are infected with malaria parasites, have been used to test antimalarial drugs in development.  We sought to develop a human model of artemisinin-resistant (ART-R) malaria that could be used to evaluate the efficacy of antimalarial drugs against ART-R malaria. What did the researchers do and find? We conducted 2 malaria VIS. In a pilot study, 2 healthy participants were infected with ART-R parasites. In a comparative study, participants were randomised to be infected with either ART-R (13 participants) or artemisinin-sensitive (ART-S; 9 participants) parasites. In both studies, participants were given a single dose of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate[AS]) 8 or 9 days after infection.  Malaria was well tolerated in the pilot study (36 adverse events reported) and the comparative study (277 adverse events reported); no serious adverse events were reported in the studies. Common adverse events included headache, pyrexia, myalgia, nausea, and chills.  In the comparative study, parasites took significantly longer to clear from the blood of participants after AS administration for participants infected with ART-R parasites (6.5 hours) compared with participants infected with ART-S parasites (3.2 hours). What do these findings mean? We have developed the first (to our knowledge) human model of ART-R malaria, the results of which, although based on a relatively small sample size, indicate potential to be safely used to assess the efficacy of new drugs against ART-R parasites.  The longer time to clear ART-R parasites from the blood of participants after AS administration is comparable with the observations from studies conducted in the Greater Mekong subregion, which suggests that the findings from this human model of ART-R malaria are relevant for clinical malarial patients.

Artemisinin resistance is characterised by a delayed clearance phenotype, with a parasite clearance half-life >5 hours [2]. This drug-resistant phenotype is linked to a number of specific nonsynonymous mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum kelch13 gene [3,4]. New drugs to treat malaria infection with artemisinin-resistant (ART-R) parasites are needed. The development of antimalarial drugs has been accelerated by volunteer infection studies (VIS), in which healthy volunteers are experimentally infected with malaria parasites to evaluate the efficacy of candidate antimalarial drugs [5]. VIS allow early accrual of efficacy and dose-response data, thereby minimising the risk of failure when conducting phase 2 studies in patients with clinical malaria. The induced blood-stage malaria (IBSM) model, a type of VIS in which volunteers are inoculated with Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes [6–9], is particularly suitable to evaluate drug efficacy against blood-stage infection, the parasite stage that causes malaria morbidity and mortality. To date, the IBSM model has only been used with artemisinin-sensitive (ART-S) parasites, mainly with 3D7, the reference strain of P. falciparum. Here, we present the results from 2 clinical trials. First, we conducted a pilot study in which we inoculated participants with ART-R P. falciparum parasites harbouring the kelch13 gene mutation R539T (K13R539T strain) [4] to determine the safety, tolerability, and clearance of infection with ART-R parasites. Then, in a comparative study, we randomised participants to be inoculated with ART-R (K13R539T strain) or ART-S (3D7 strain) parasites and compared the clearance profiles of these 2 parasite strains after administration of a single oral dose of artesunate (AS). We used single-dose AS monotherapy rather than a longer course of AS or artemisinin-based combination therapy because this study design provided the best opportunity to investigate the pharmacodynamic effect of AS alone on the clearance of ART-R and ART-S parasites without the confounding effect of a partner drug. Furthermore, we had previously observed that single-dose drug administration with subcurative intention is a very effective design for characterising the pharmacodynamic effect of an antimalarial drug [7]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and infectivity of ART-R parasites and to compare the parasitological response of the ART-R and ART-S parasites to AS in healthy participants inoculated in the IBSM model. We hypothesised that AS would clear parasitaemia from participants infected with ART-R parasites at a slower rate compared to participants infected with ART-S parasites, as observed in field studies [2].  Methods Study design We conducted 2 consecutive phase 1, single-centre, open-label studies: a pilot study and a randomised study. In both studies, healthy participants were inoculated with ART-R parasites using the IBSM model. In the pilot study, 2 participants were inoculated with ART-R parasites with a 3-week interval in between. In the comparative study, participants were randomised to receive ART-R or ART-S parasites. The studies were conducted at Q-Pharm Pty Ltd, Brisbane, Australia, and approved by both the QIMR Berghofer and Australian Red Cross Blood Service Human Research Ethics Committees. The studies were registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12617000244303 and ACTRN12617001394336. Data were analysed according to the clinical trial protocols (pilot and comparative studies, S1 and S2 Appendices, respectively) and the statistical analysis plan (comparative study, S2 Appendix), which was finalised before the data were locked for analysis. Participants Healthy adults were eligible for the study if they met all eligibility criteria (S1 and S2 Texts). Briefly, participants were malaria naïve, males (pilot study), or males and nonpregnant females (comparative study), aged 18–55 years. All participants gave written informed consent before enrollment and were compensated financially for their involvement in this study. Randomisation and masking Randomisation schedules were generated using STATA release 13 (StataCorp LLC, www.stata.com). Participants in the comparative study were to be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ART-R or ART-S parasites. However, because of recruitment limitations, 3 participants in each cohort were randomised to receive ART-S parasites and the remainder randomised to receive ART-R parasites. The study was open label. Procedures The ART-R P. falciparum isolate (Cam3.IIR539T, here referred to as the K13R539T strain) was originally collected from a patient in Cambodia with natural malaria infection [4]. The ART-R master cell bank was manufactured using a bioreactor system as previously described [10] and characterised at the time of release (S3 Text). Although the master cell bank was screened for blood-borne pathogens, the risk of pathogen transmission cannot be completely excluded with any blood transfusion, although the risk should be considerably lower than a single-unit blood transfusion in which the volume transfused is >5 logs higher. In vitro drug resistance testing and the ring-stage survival assay confirmed the ART-R parasites were resistant to artemisinin and sensitive to piperaquine (S3 Text and S1 Table). ART-R (K13R539T strain) and ART-S (3D7 strain) parasite inocula were produced using methods previously described [9]. In the pilot study, participants were intravenously inoculated with approximately 2,800 viable ART-R parasite-infected erythrocytes on Day 0. In the comparative study, participants were intravenously inoculated with approximately 2,800 viable ART-R parasite-infected erythrocytes on Day 0, or with approximately 2,800 viable ART-S parasite-infected erythrocytes on Day 1. ART-R infected participants were inoculated a day earlier than ART-S infected participants so that parasites were at a similar stage of development at the time of AS administration (see Results section for more detail). Parasitaemia was monitored by quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the P. falciparum 18S rRNA gene [11]. Gametocytaemia was monitored by reverse transcription qPCR (qRT-PCR) for female-specific pfs25 mRNA and male-specific pfMGET mRNA [12]. Single-dose oral AS (approximately 2 mg/kg; Guilin Pharmaceutical Shanghai Co. Ltd) was administered in tablet form on Day 9 in both studies. If recrudescence occurred after AS administration, participants received an oral dose of 120 mg dihydroartemisinin (DHA)/960 mg piperaquine phosphate (PQP, Eurartesim, Alfasigma S.p.A.; pilot study) or 960 mg PQP (PCI Pharma Services; comparative study). On approximately Day 26, or earlier if a second recrudescence occurred, all participants received a standard curative course, taken orally, of atovaquone/proguanil (A/P, Malarone, GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd). Participants also received an oral dose of 45 mg primaquine (PQ, Primacin, Boucher & Muir Pty Ltd) to clear gametocytes at the end of the study (pilot study and comparative study Cohort 1) or on approximately Day 23 (comparative study cohorts 2 and 3). Transmissibility to mosquitoes was investigated in the comparative study as an exploratory objective; these results will be reported separately. Participants had regular follow-up visits until the End of Study visit on Day 90 ± 14 days (pilot study) or Day 28 ± 3 days (comparative study). Fig 1 illustrates the study design.

Study design. (A) In the pilot study, participants were IV inoculated with approximately 2,800 viable ART-R parasite-infected erythrocytes on Day 0, followed by AS administration on Day 9. Participants were confined at the clinical site for 3 days, during which they were administered DHA/PQP on Day 11. A/P and PQ administration occurred on Day 26 with the End of Study visit on Day 90 ± 14 days. (B) In the comparative study, participants were IV inoculated with approximately 2,800 viable ART-R parasite-infected erythrocytes (Day 0) or with approximately 2,800 viable ART-S parasite-infected erythrocytes (Day 1) and administered AS on Day 9. PQP administration occurred on Day 11 for ART-R infected participants and between Days 15 and 20 for ART-S infected participants. In the comparative study, the majority of participants were followed up after the End of Study visit for qPCR and/or safety monitoring.

Parasitaemia was measured post-AS at specified timepoints until 84 hours (S4 Table), then twice daily, daily, or every second day until parasitaemia was low and stable, then 3 times per week until A/P administration, and at the end of the study. Plasma concentrations of AS and its active metabolite DHA were measured in blood samples (S4 Text) at the time points specified in the protocol. Outcomes A primary outcome of both studies was safety and tolerability of infection with ART-R parasites (and of ART-S parasites in the comparative study only), determined by evaluating adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, clinical biochemistry, haematology, and urinalysis. In the pilot study, another primary outcome was the infectivity of ART-R parasites, which was determined by the presence of parasites in inoculated participants as measured by qPCR. In the comparative study, another primary outcome was to compare parasite clearance profiles of ART-R and ART-S parasites after single-dose AS administration, which was determined by estimating the slope of parasite clearance curves, the parasite reduction ratio per 48 hours in the logarithmic scale (log 10 PRR 48 ), and parasite clearance half-lives. Based on previous IBSM studies with ART-S parasites, AS clearance data from ART-R strains in the field [2], and data from the pilot study, we hypothesised that mean parasite clearance after AS administration would be 30% slower for ART-R infected participants compared to ART-S infected participants [13]. Both studies had the exploratory outcome to calculate the following pharmacokinetic parameters for AS and DHA: area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC 0-last ); area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinite time (AUC 0-∞ ); maximum concentration (C max ); time of C max (t max ); and elimination half-life (t 1/2 ). Statistical analysis The sample size of the comparative study was calculated with nQuery Advisor version 7.0 (Statsols, www.statsols.com). Satterthwaite t test of equal means but unequal variances was used to calculate sample size with a one-sided α = 0.05, an estimated 30% mean difference in parasite clearance slope between ART-R and ART-S parasites, and a power of 80%. The estimated sample size using a 2:1 ratio of ART-R to ART-S was 18 to 9 participants. Participants were to be enrolled in 3 cohorts of 9 participants each. Review of parasitaemia data between cohorts was conducted using an adaptive design to re-evaluate the sample size necessary to reach the primary outcomes. The parasite clearance slope is the slope of the linear regression of log 10 parasitemia over time after AS administration, derived from an iterative procedure [13]. The weighted mean of the parasite clearance slope was estimated by the inverse-variance method using the corresponding standard errors of the clearance slope and presented as log 10 PRR 48 and the parasite clearance half-life, as previously described [13]. An omnibus test [14] was used to determine differences between the weighted mean parasite clearance slopes of ART-R and ART-S parasites. Analyses were determined using R version 3.5.0. Parasite growth dynamics were estimated using a sine-wave model to capture the oscillatory nature of the parasite growth [15]. The sine-wave growth model was applied to the pre-AS qPCR data using R version 3.5.0 and R package nlme version 3.1–137. For the pilot study, the sine-wave growth model was estimated for each participant, and the life cycle duration of ART-R parasites was estimated from the inverse-variance weighted mean of the sine-wave period estimates (S5 Text). For the comparative study, the parasite growth dynamics for ART-R and ART-S parasites were modelled using the sine-wave mixed-effects model (S5 Text). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental analysis using R version 3.4.2 and R package IQRtools version 0.9.1 (IntiQuan GmbH). Mann–Whitney U tests were used to compare pharmacokinetic parameters of ART-R and ART-S infected participants.  Discussion In this study, we developed the first (to our knowledge) human model of ART-R P. falciparum malaria. Infection of healthy, malaria-naïve participants with ART-R parasites was safe and well tolerated. ART-R parasites cleared from all participants with available antimalarial drugs. As expected, ART-R parasites took longer to clear than ART-S parasites. The observed difference in parasite clearance between ART-R infected participants and ART-S infected participants was larger than the 30% difference in mean parasite clearance rates that the study was powered to detect. The longer parasite clearance half-life after a single-dose of AS observed in ART-R infected participants compared with ART-S infected participants (6.5 versus 3.2 hours) agrees with the values reported in malaria patients treated with AS in the Greater Mekong subregion (>5 hours) [1–3,17]. These results are in contrast to a recently reported study of splenectomised Aotus monkeys infected with either wild-type or ART-R mutant parasites in which no difference in parasite clearance half-life was reported [18]. Parasite clearance after drug treatment is a complex process involving factors such as the mechanism of action of the drug, splenic clearance of erythrocytes containing dead or damaged parasites, and the effect of host immunity. The delayed clearance observed in field ART-R infections could be confounded by these factors [19]. However, our studies used malaria-naïve participants given a single dose of antimalarial drug rules out these confounding effects. In the comparative study, we inoculated ART-R infected participants a day earlier than ART-S infected participants to account for the longer duration of the parasite life cycle of ART-R parasites, as estimated with the data from the pilot study. By inoculating ART-R infected participants one day earlier, we aimed to administer AS at the same stage of parasite life cycle for both strains. Therefore, the difference in life cycle duration between the 2 strains is not expected to influence the comparison of parasite clearance. This study was designed to characterise the pharmacodynamic response after a single dose of AS; therefore, we anticipated that recrudescence would occur [20]. The persisting low parasitaemia observed in ART-S infected participants after AS administration could indicate the presence of dormant parasites, which have been previously described in vitro [21,22], or could be a consequence of a fraction of ART-S parasites surviving single-dose AS. Further investigation is required to understand the reason for this persisting low parasitaemia. The recrudescence after PQP administration (960 mg) that occurred in 5 ART-R infected participants was likely due to insufficient drug exposure to kill all parasites rather than to drug resistance because the ART-R parasite strain tested PQP-sensitive by in vitro assay. The adverse events observed in this study were in line with previous IBSM studies with ART-S parasites conducted at our site and elsewhere [6–9]. The transaminase elevations were transient and asymptomatic and were not associated with clinically significant elevations in bilirubin. Similar liver function changes have been reported in previous IBSM studies [8] and sporozoite challenge studies [23], as well as in natural malaria infections [24,25], indicating these elevations are likely due to the inflammatory process in malaria infection. No evidence of myocardial damage was detected as a cause of the 2 cases of ventricular extrasystoles that occurred during the comparative study. After comprehensive investigations, both adverse events were attributed to undiagnosed predispositions to cardiac arrhythmias that were unmasked by the febrile illness. Cardiac events with associated myocardial damage have been reported in malaria VIS with sporozoites [26,27]. Furthermore, serendipitous detection of benign cardiac arrhythmias has been documented in early phase clinical trials [28,29]. The main limitation of this study is that the ART-R and ART-S parasite strains do not share the same genetic background. An optimal strain for comparison may have been the ART-S parasite generated by back mutation of the ART-R strain [4]. Furthermore, the R539T genotype has been outcompeted by other genotypes such as C580Y [30]. However, observations from field studies have demonstrated that parasite clearance half-life in patients carrying either the R539T or the C580Y mutation are similar [31]. Therefore, we believe that our model is suitable to investigate drugs effective against ART-R parasites. Furthermore, both the R539T and the C580Y strains are widely distributed across the Greater Mekong subregion [31,32]. Another limitation of the study is that our results are difficult to generalize to other populations. All the participants in these studies were malaria naïve, and therefore their response to malaria infection may be different to patients in endemic areas, where patients may have different levels of immunity to malaria. In addition, levels of parasitaemia are lower in VIS than in clinical malaria, which further hinders generalisability. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, the delayed clearance profile of ART-R parasites after AS observed in these studies is comparable to observations from field studies [1–3,17]. This is the first time that a Plasmodium spp. strain has been isolated from a patient with clinical malaria, used to manufacture a master cell bank in vitro in compliance with good manufacturing practice, and inoculated into healthy participants. We have shown that this approach is safe and can be used for VIS with other parasite strains for drug development. In conclusion, we developed the first (to our knowledge) human model of ART-R P. falciparum malaria. Although based on a relatively small sample size, results indicate that this ART-R IBSM model is safe and replicates the delayed parasite clearance phenotype documented in the field. The ART-R IBSM model will be a powerful tool to test the efficacy of candidate antimalarial drugs against ART-R infections.

Hence, this study aims to determine the magnitude of hypertension and its associated factors among HIV-positive patients receiving care at referral hospitals of Northwest Ethiopia Materials and methods A cross-sectional study design was conducted to determine the burden of hypertension in patients living with HIV receiving care at referral hospitals of Northwest Ethiopia between November 2018 and May 2019. Four hundred seven randomly selected adult patients were included for the study. Using standardized questionnaire, sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical data were collected. Anthropometric parameters, fasting blood sugar as well as lipid profiles were determined. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Result A total of 407 study subjects with 98% response rate have been included in this study. The prevalence of hypertension was 14.0% (95% CI: 10.63,17.37). Elementary educational status as compared to no education [AOR (95% CI) 2.75 (1.12,6.75), p< 0.05], moderate monthly income compared to low [AOR (95% CI) 4.27 (2.09,8.73), p<0.01], waist circumference [AOR (95% CI) 4.27 (2.09,8.73), p<0.01], taking concomitant other drug therapy [AOR (95% CI) 5.72 (2.25,14.54), p<0.01] and duration of antiretroviral therapy [AOR (95% CI) 1.12 (1.04,1.20) were significantly associated with hypertension. Conclusion Hypertension is not uncommon in patients living with HIV. Educational status, monthly income, waist circumference, concomitant drug therapy and duration of antiretroviral therapy are linked with hypertension. The finding pinpoints that health care providers should work up on risk factors to reduce the burden of hypertension among the patients.

Hypertension (HTN), characterized by persistently raised blood pressure, is the primary modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) which are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in PLHIV [2, 3]. HTN is a particular target among different non-AIDS chronic diseases [4]. Its trend has been increasing among PLHIV associated with substantially increased survivorship of the patients due to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [5, 6]. Some studies have also revealed the magnitude of hypertension in PLHIV to be higher than the general population [7, 8]. This increased risk is partly attributed to HIV related factors like long-term effects of HAART, hypercoagulation, premature atherosclerosis, activation of the immune system and elevated systemic inflammatory markers [8–13]. Researchers in public health as well as clinical streams have long been recognizing the importance of HTN among PLHIV. Plethora of studies have reported data on HTN among PLHIV in different countries and regions across the world [5, 14–26]. The reports vary from 4.0% to 67.0% by study population, area and time [25, 26]. Although the reports give useful data for clinical practitioners and public health experts to prevent and treat hypertension regionally, hypertension among HIV positive patients in low- and middle-income countries has gained a recent attention [27]. Data on the burden of hypertension among PLHIV have still been limited in Africa as well as Ethiopia, and the study area in particular. Many risk factors such as older age, male gender, family history, ethnicity, longer duration of HIV infection, high viral load, smoking, alcohol use, comorbidity state, other drugs and substance use, low CD4 count, and obesity may be attributed to the high burden of HTN in HIV-infected subjects [21, 28]. In addition, certain drugs in ART regimen combinations have also been indicated to lead to hypertension among PLHIV [29, 30]. In support of this, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 studies enrolling about 44,903 HIV-infected patients revealed the risk of hypertension to be higher in PLHIV exposed to ART as compared to ART-naive patients [31]. With the current World Health Organization (WHO) “test and treat” recommendation, there are growing number of ART-exposed patients, and an increased burden of hypertension in PLHIV is inevitable [32]. On the other hand, a systematic review and meta-analysis from sub-Saharan Africa countries revealed lower blood pressure levels among PLHIV than uninfected adults [33]. A population-based study in South Africa also indicated that hypertension was less common among HIV-infected adults [34]. Generally, assessing the burden of hypertension among PLHIV are needed for decision-making as well as evidence-based planning to restructure and integrate tailored care of hypertension into HIV/AIDS management package. It is difficult to do this integration without having strong evidence on the burden of hypertension among HIV-infected patients and its risk factors. In view of the importance of the problem and the paucity of evidence on it, the main aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the magnitude of hypertension and its associated risk factors among HIV-positive patients receiving care at referral hospitals of Northwest Ethiopia.  Materials and methods Study design, setting, population and period Hospital based cross-sectional study was carried out among adult PLHIV on HAART. The study was conducted between November 2018 and May 2019 among the patients attending the ART clinics of Debre Markos Referral Hospital (DMRH) and Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital (FHRH), two of the three referral hospitals in Northwest Ethiopia. The referral hospitals have been serving more than 10,000 PLHIV. Services in these ART clinics include: HIV testing and counseling, CD4 count tests and viral load so as to monitor the progress of the therapy, antiretroviral drugs dispensing, education and counselling to improve treatment adherence and to decrease defaulters as well as opportunistic infections follow-up. Whereas patients aged 18 years or older and signed an informed consent form to take part in the study were included in the study, pregnant women, and patients who were seriously ill and unable to respond were excluded from the study. In addition, patients on corticosteroids, oral contraceptives or other medications which may influence blood pressure were excluded. Sample size determination and sampling technique By using the following single population proportion formula, the sample size (n) of this study was calculated. Considering the following parameters, 95% level of confidence level (z α/2 = 1.96), 5% of marginal error (d = 0.05), 6% non-response rate, and taking the prevalence (53%) of hypertension (p = 0.53, q = 1-p) in Ethiopian HIV-infected adults [23], the final sample size was determined to be 415. In addition, simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants during their follow-up visits; the study participants were withdrawn from the total patients on follow up by lottery method from their registry. Variables of the study Hypertension among HIV was the dependent variable of this study whereas diseases related factors like viral load, co-morbidities, duration of ART, WHO stage of the disease, duration HIV, presence of opportunistic infections; treatment related factors like concomitant drug therapy, type of ART regimens, duration of ART; Patient related factors such as age, gender, educational level, occupation, income status as well as patient’s behavioral related factors such as history of drug use, lifestyle of the patients were considered as predictor variables of the study. The primary outcome of interest of the study was hypertension, which was defined according to WHO to be persistently elevated blood pressure, SBP≥140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg, or reported uses of antihypertensive medication [35]. Patients were grouped as smokers (yes/no), yes, if they smoke at least one cigarette for the last 12 months, and alcohol consumer (yes/no), yes, if they consume at least twice weekly of any alcoholic drinks. Regular physical activity was considered in patients reporting at least 30 min of intense physical activity, once a week or more to be categorized as yes [21, 22]. BMI was used to classify underweight: BMI<18.5 kg/m2, normal BMI: 18.5–24.99 kg/m2, and overweight: BMI: ≥25 kg/m2. Data collection We used a questionnaire as a data collection tool adapted from WHO STEP wise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance [36, 37]. This tool consists of three parts for collecting data; the first is core and expanded sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, the second involves core and expanded physical measurement, and the third consisted of biochemical measurements. After having informed consent from the study participants, sociodemographic data such as age, sex, educational status, marital status, monthly income, occupation and residence were collected. In addition, behavioral data like alcohol consumption habit, smoking and regular physical activity were collected both from patient interview and medical records of the patients using the questionnaire. Using the checklist, clinical data including viral load, comorbidity state, WHO stage, opportunistic infection, another drug therapy, type of ART regimen, other substance use and duration of HIV/AIDS were also collected from the patient’s medical record. Furthermore, anthropometric parameters (waist circumference, hip circumference, weight and height) and blood pressure (BP) data have been collected from the study participants. Finally, fasting blood sugar and lipid profiles have been determined. All the data were collected by trained and experienced clinical nurses and laboratory technologists with strict supervision of the principal investigator. About 5 milliliters of fasting venous blood sample was taken from each study subject. After separation of serum from the whole blood, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and fasting blood sugar (FBS) was analyzed at laboratory department of the referral hospitals, following the standard operating procedures. The blood specimen collection, separation of serum, and the laboratory analysis of the metabolites were done by experienced medical laboratory technologists working in the hospitals. BP was measured by nurse professionals using a sphygmomanometer. The BP measurement was taken from the left arm, three times at 5 min interval after the patient had been sitting for at least 30 min. The average of the last two of three measurements was estimated and used in the analysis. By using a digital balance with an attached height measurement, the body weight and height readings were taken to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm, respectively. The height readings of the study participants were taken while they are facing directly ahead and the weight readings were obtained by placing the weighing balance instrument on a flat hard surface. Hip and waist circumferences were also measured to a precision of 0.1 cm by using a tape that is non-stretchable. Hip circumference readings were taken at a point where maximum circumference can be obtained over the buttocks with a tape in a horizontal plane, touching the skin but not compressing it. Waist circumference was read with a flexible inelastic tape placed on the midpoint between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest in a perpendicular plane to the long axis of the body while subjects were standing and breathing normally. The European cutoff was used to determine the waist circumference measurements as per WHO. As per the guidelines, the elevated waist circumferences of female and male, respectively, are ≥80 and ≥ 94cm [38]. Laboratory analysis Blood samples were analyzed for FBS level and lipid profileS (TC, HDL-c, LDL-c and TG)) using ABX Pentra 400 machine. Enzymatic colorimetric assay method was used for the measurement of total cholesterol (CHODPAP method) and triglyceride (GPO-PAP method), while direct homogeneous enzymatic colorimetric assay technique was utilized for the measurement of HDL-c and LDLc. FBG level was measured by glucose oxidase method (GOD-PAP). Data analysis and interpretation All data were cleaned, coded and entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and exported to the Statistical package for Social Science (SPSS) version 24.0 for statistical analysis. Figures and tables were used for data presentation. Frequency distribution was used for presenting categorical data whereas mean ± standard deviation (SD) was used for continuous data. In addition, associations for the predictors and outcome variables were assessed using logistic regression analysis. All variables with P-value <0.25 in bivariate logistic regression analysis were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model to control confounding effects. Crude odds ratio (COR) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% CI were reported. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P-value of <0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Data quality assurance The questionnaire was pretested by study populations at Finote Selam Hospital before data collection and subsequent modification has been made when any difficulty or doubt occurred. The collected data has been checked for the clarity, consistency and completeness. The data collection questionnaire was adapted from a standard tool and all variables were filled on the data extraction format daily. All the laboratory processes were handled by experienced health care professionals. Ethics approval and consent to participate Ethics was approved from Debre Markos University, School of Medicine, Ethics committee with a letter serial number, SOM/338/33/19, and date, 1/18/2019. Then, permission was taken from the managers of hospitals by paraphrasing their approval signature on the letter before data collection starts. In addition, the study participants signed informed consent before data collection begins. Participants were informed about the objective of the work, potential minimal risks and benefits of the research. The investigators also kept the confidentiality of the information provided by the respondents by not using any patient identifier such as name.  Result Socio‑demographic and behavioral characteristics of participants Table 1 summarizes the sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants. A total of 407 study subjects with 98% response rate have been included in this study. The majority of the participants were female 246 (60.4%). The average age of the respondents was 38.6 ± 10.3 years with age range between 18 and 75 years. In addition, the majority of the respondents (71.3%) have attained at least primary level of education, and about half of the subjects (53.8%) were not married. About 17.4% of the participants were governmental employee in occupation, and the majority of the participants live in urban areas with most of them having monthly income of less than 2000 Ethiopian Birr. Finally, about 11.8% of the participants had history of alcohol drinking behavior whereas only 2.5% of them did smoke cigarette and majority of them (87%) did not do regular exercise.

About one fifth of the participants were underweight and 16.5% of the patients were overweight /obese. Regarding to the regional distribution of fat, two fifth of the patients had waist circumference above the cut-off value and about 75% of the patients had high waist to hip ratio which is a better indicator of body fat distribution. The majority of the participants had viral load (copies/mL) less than 1000, and 19.7% of the subjects had opportunistic infection or comorbidity. In addition, about 11.3% of the HIV patients used drugs and substances other than ART mostly steroid drugs and contraceptives. Finally, most of the patients were in WHO clinical stage-I; 71.1% of the patients have HIV duration of more than five years, and TDF/3TC/EFV was the most frequent cART regimen (Table 2).

Therefore, these variables have been included in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Educational status, monthly income, WC, concomitant drug therapy and duration of cART were significantly associated with hypertension in HIV infected patients in the multivariate analysis. Educational status was significantly associated with hypertension among HIV infected patients. Patients who attended education to elementary level were about 2.75 times more likely to have hypertension as compared to those with no education, [AOR (95% CI) 2.75 (1.12,6.75), p< 0.05]. HIV patients with monthly income of 2000–5000 ETB were at higher risk to have hypertension as compared to patients with monthly income of less than 2000 ETB [AOR (95% CI) 4.27 (2.09,8.73), p<0.01]. In addition, WC was significantly associated with hypertension in the HIV infected patients. For a centimeter increase in WC, the patients were 7% more likely to have hypertension, [AOR (95% CI) 1.07 (1.03,1.11), p< 0.05]. Moreover, concomitant drug therapy and duration of cART have shown statistically significant association with hypertension in the patients. Patients with concomitant drug therapy were about 5.72 times more likely to have hypertension as compared to their counterparts, [AOR (95% CI) 5.72 (2.25,14.54), p<0.01]. In addition, duration of cART was significantly associated with hypertension in the patients. For each year increase in duration of cART, the patients were 12% more likely to have hypertension, [AOR (95% CI) 1.12 (1.04,1.20), p< 0.05] (Table 3).

Bivariate and multivariate analyses of socio-demographic, anthropometric and clinical risk factors for hypertension of people living with HIV receiving care at referral hospitals of Northwest Ethiopia, 2019 (n = 407). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238114.t003  Discussion This study has been carried out with the objective of determining the magnitude and identifying associated factors of hypertension in HIV-infected patients on combined HAART. The overall magnitude of hypertension among PLHIV in this study was 14.0%, which is lower than the estimated prevalence of the general population of Ethiopia (31.2%) [39]. However, in line with previous studies [7, 8], the current finding is slightly higher than the result (12.5%) of a community based study in the study area [40]. The finding is also comparable with results of studies conducted in different countries including, 12.7% in Eastern Ethiopia [27], 17.1% in Northwest Ethiopia [41], 15.9% in Southern Ethiopia [42], 12.3% in Nigeria [19], 11.9% in Spain [43] and 13.5% in the United States [44]. However, the magnitude in this study is lower than the finding from related studies; 29.7% in Northeast Ethiopia [21], 34.4% Southwest Ethiopia, 29.9% in Zimbabwe [45], 43.0% in the United States [14] and 25.2% in a meta-analysis of prevalence of hypertension among people living with HIV [5]. On the other hand the result of this study is higher than some studies conducted in different parts of the world including Ethiopia [20, 26, 46, 47]. The variation could be due to differences in the HIV infection stages and duration, type of ART used and its duration or because of variations in the lifestyle and age distribution of the studied participants. In addition, the difference may also be due to differences in sample size and study design, hypertension definition, and the socioeconomic, demographic, ethnic and metabolic-related factors. The link between HIV/AIDS and CVD is explained by several proposed mechanisms [48, 49]. Endothelial dysfunction resulting in increased CVD risk is contributed by chronic inflammation, platelet activation, and hypercoagulability mediated by HIV infection per se [50, 51]. The mechanism by which HIV induces endothelial dysfunction is proposed to be activation of white blood cells resulting in the secretion of cytokines, and a direct influence of tat and gp120 proteins released by HIV on the endothelium [52]. The other mechanism involves oxidative damage of the endothelium because of excess nitric oxide that reacts with oxygen radicals to producing peroxynitrite [53]. It has been shown that the use of HAART in PLHIV reduces the markers of coagulation and endothelial function [48–50]. Educational status, monthly income, WC, concomitant drug therapy and duration of cART were significantly associated with hypertension in HIV infected patients. Patients attending education to the level of elementary school and those with monthly income of 2000–5000 ETB were more likely to develop hypertension as compared to those with no education and monthly income of less than 2000 ETB, respectively. A possible justification for this positive association could be due to economic improvement facilitates access to some attractive unhealthy behaviors such as fast food-based diet and physical inactivity [54]. Concomitant drug therapy for other diseases was significantly associated with hypertension in the study subjects. This is due to the reason that the particularly used drugs in the patients such as corticosteroids, antidepressants and estrogens can induce either a persistent or transient blood pressure increment [55]. In addition, in line with other studies [56–59], WC was significantly associated with hypertension in the HIV infected patients. For a centimeter increase in WC, the patients were 7% more likely to have hypertension. The cellular mechanisms responsible for the association between metabolic or cardiovascular complications and WC are not well understood. However, different factors have been proposed. These hypothesized factors are sympathetic nervous system activation, genetic predisposition, insulin resistance and release of detrimental inflammatory adipocytokines by intra-abdominal adipose tissue as well as release of cortisol and angiotensinogen [60, 61]. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis of the present study indicated an independent association between duration of ART exposure and hypertension. For each year increase in duration of cART, the patients were 12% more likely to have hypertension. This finding is in line with other studies [27, 31, 62]. This association of the duration of cART and hypertension could be mediated directly through changes in endothelial function or it could be due to longevity as well as the age-associated comorbidities like ART-related changes in body composition and weight gain [21, 28].  Limitation of the study This study has limitations mainly related to the nature of cross-sectional study design; causality cannot be established. Stronger study designs like prospective cohort and clinical trials are then called for so as to identify the predictors of hypertension in the study subjects. Moreover, environmental factors like dietary factors as well as genetic factors have not been studied, and inclusion of HIV negative controls would have been better as a comparison group to minimize confounders. The study being limited to only two health institution, representativeness may also be affected.  Conclusion and recommendation Hypertension is not uncommon in PLHIV. Educational status, monthly income, waist circumference, concomitant drug therapy and duration of antiretroviral therapy were significantly associated with hypertension. The finding pinpoints that health care providers should work up on risk factors to reduce the burden of hypertension among the patients in order to prevent the risk of cardiovascular complications, and improve the health of PLHIV on ART.  Acknowledgments I want to thank the study subjects for their consent to participate in the study, and the data collectors, nurses and laboratory technologists of Debre Markos Referral Hospital and Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital for their cooperation. My heartfelt acknowledgment should also be extended to Debre Markos University for funding the study."

Others donned white ribbons to show solidarity with growing protests against the monarchy and the military-led Thai administration.  The demonstrations began months ago at colleges and have swiftly spread to other institutions and into the streets, hinting at growing public support for reform. The monarchy seems to have taken note.  On Sunday, at least 10,000 demonstrators crowded the streets of the capital city of Bangkok in one of the largest protests since the 2014 coup that put the current prime minister in power. Protesters held placards that read, “Power to the people,” and chanted, “Down with dictatorship, long live democracy.” The demonstrators have borrowed imagery from pop culture and social media, dressing in Harry Potter costumes and singing a Thai rendition of the revolutionary anthem “Do You Hear the People Sing?” from the musical Les Miserables.  The protests began with three central demands: a new election, constitutional reform, and an end to the crackdown on government critics. Frustration has intensified since the Thai government in February dissolved Future Forward, a new opposition political party with broad support among young voters. Many saw the party as a way to advance reforms after the disputed March 2019 election that returned Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to power.  In June, prominent pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit was abducted in Cambodia, and several other exiled Thai activists have disappeared in recent years. The Thai government denied any involvement.  Students also criticized Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn for staying at a hotel in Germany while the coronavirus outbreak slammed his country. One protester on Sunday wore a shirt that said “Send love to Germany.” The pandemic has shut down the country’s tourism industry, hitting the economy hard and resurrecting complaints of inequality.  On Aug. 10, the demonstrators introduced a 10-point manifesto for reforming the monarchy, including protecting the freedom to criticize leadership and curbing the king’s power. Such vocal criticism is unprecedented in Thailand, which has one of the world’s strictest laws banning defamation of the monarchy. Violators can face up to 15 years in prison.  Chan-ocha said the king asked authorities not to enforce the law against protesters, but officials found other ways to crack down on dissent. Police on Thursday arrested nine activists involved in writing the manifesto and held them on charges of sedition. Activists said they saw a police list of 20 others facing arrest.  John Ciorciari, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, said the king’s stance shows he understands the strained public perception of the monarchy. But there is no indication the legal harassment, such as the latest arrests, will stop. Ciorciari also pointed to a statement this month from the nation’s powerful army chief, Apirat Kongsompong, who said the “hatred of the nation” is more deadly than the coronavirus and can’t be cured. “That was seen as a thinly veiled threat,” Ciorciari said.  The protesters have vowed to continue demonstrating until the government acts on their demands. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, an associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the opposition has staying power: “If the Prayut government, the Thai military, or others think this youth movement lacks sufficient will and traction, they are likely to be gravely mistaken.”"

Data given to SAGE - Number 10's scientific advisory panel - revealed 800 patients who were hospitalised between March and August had travelled abroad in the past fortnight.  It does not necessarily mean they caught the virus overseas but Covid-19 has an incubation period that lasts up to 14 days, suggesting they may well have brought the virus back to the UK.  A quarter of the hospitalised patients (200) had been to Spain, which was at the epicentre of Europe's coronavirus crisis before the deadly pathogen had reached British soil. It was followed by Italy (92), where thousands of families flocked to during the February half-term to ski.  But staggeringly, only three patients told doctors they had visited China, where the coronavirus was first detected in December 2019. Eight were from Thailand, five were from the Philippines and zero had been to Vietnam - all countries on the 'high-risk' list at the start of the pandemic.  Covid-19 may have also been imported from several luxury holiday destinations, including Barbados, the Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic.  The data - released today by the government - was presented to SAGE. It is just one of dozens of papers presented to advisers over recent months to help guide ministers through the crisis.  Covid-19 entered Britain through at least 79 countries, NHS data for hospitalised patients show. Patients most commonly reported going to Spain (205), other parts of the UK (116), Italy (92), France (35) and Germany (35) in the two weeks before their infection  TOP 10 COUNTRIES: HOW MANY CASES AND DEATHS ARE THERE NOW? Spain Cases, 371,000 Deaths, 27,797 UK Cases, 322,000 Deaths, 41,403 Italy Cases, 256,000 Deaths, 35,418 France Cases, 230,000 Deaths, 30,480 US Cases, 5.59million Deaths, 174,000 Cyprus Cases, 1,359 Deaths, 20 Portugal Cases, 54,992 Deaths, 1,788 Austria Cases, 24,431 Deaths, 729 Barbados Cases , 155 Deaths, 7 India Cases, 2.91million Deaths, 54,849 Pakistan Cases, 292,000 Deaths, 6,219 Advertisement  The COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) collates information from NHS hospitals across the UK to give an idea of the symptoms, characteristics and outcomes of the sickest patients.  Between March 10 and August 5, CO-CIN had recorded information for 77,676 patients who were confirmed to have Covid-19.  Patients give information at the time they are admitted. However, it is not possible to get a full set of data because some patients are too unwell to answer basic questions about their travel history or background.  A total of 23,392 patients answered the question: 'Did you travel in the two weeks prior to your symptoms starting?'  A third (825) stated that they had, but only 797 named the country they had been to.  The other 54,284 patients did not answer the question or data was missing, therefore the following information only gives a snapshot of where hospitalised patients had travelled to before they became infected.  And the data only refers to those who ended up in hospital, and not the hundreds of thousands of people who suffered a mild infection.  The most commonly reported travel destination was Spain, where cases soared in March at a pace two weeks ahead of the UK.  Neighbouring Italy and France (35) were also on the higher end of the scale, having seen thousands of cases at the height of the crisis just before the UK was stuck. It can be assumed that these European locations were reported so commonly because they are visited so often by Britons.  It took the Government three weeks after the first two cases were detected in Rome to announce that anyone feeling ill after coming home from northern Italy should self-isolate.  The second most common country was the UK, indicating domestic travel for holidays or work may have played a significant role in the spread of the disease.  But Croatia was not on the list, with none of the patients revealed they had travelled there before being struck down with the disease at any point during the pandemic.  Croatia has become the latest country to be added to the UK's quarantine list after a spike in infections.  Travellers arriving in the UK after 4am on Saturday will have to self-isolate for 14 days, it was revealed last night, along with Austria and Trinidad and Tobago.  At the same time Portugal, where eight hospital patients reported travelling to, is now exempt from the UK's requirement to quarantine.  The quarantine list is based on diagnosed cases being reported in that country.  A significant increase in Covid-19 infections have been recorded across Croatia, along with Spain, the Netherlands and France earlier in the month.  BRITONS SCRAMBLE TO RETURN FROM CROATIA British holidaymakers have been seen scrambling to airports in Croatia in a bid to get home before they face a two-week quarantine on their return to the UK. In scenes similar to those seen in French airports and ferry terminals last week, tourists were spotted in their numbers at Croatia's Split Airport yesterday, as the rush begins to get home by Saturday's deadline. Around 20,000 British tourists are thought to be in Croatia currently. The pictures were taken hours after the UK government announced Croatia, along with Austria and Trinidad, would be taken off the quarantine-free travel list - meaning tourists will be forced to quarantine for a fortnight on their return. The decision comes following a spike in cases in each of the three countries. Figures released by Department for Transport (DfT) indicate that the weekly incidence (cases) per 100,000 for Croatia increased from 10.4 on August 12 to 27.4 on August 19, a 164% increase. Over the same period, Trinidad and Tobago saw a 232 per cent increase in weekly incidence per 100,000, while Austria had a 93 per cent increase between August 13 and August 20 (from 10.5 per 100,000, to 20.3). Portugal meanwhile has been put on the list, meaning tourists will be allowed quarantine-free travel to popular holiday destinations, such as the Algarve, from Saturday. Advertisement  On Thursday afternoon, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted: 'Data shows we need to remove Croatia, Austria and Trinidad & Tobago from our list of #coronavirus Travel Corridors to keep infection rates DOWN.'  Several countries in the 'travel corridor' - those where Britons are free to holiday without needing to self-isolate afterwards - were on the list of countries where cases had been imported from.  Among the top 10 were nearby Cyprus, Portugal and Austria, which were reported by patients 26, 22 and 21 times respectively.  India, Pakistan and South Africa, all of which are currently battling some of the worst outbreaks the world has seen, were also high on the list.  It is not clear from the data if there is a correlation between the timings of each countries' epidemic and when patients' had travelled there.  In other words, all 11 cases from India could have been imported in March. Or they could have been in the past couple of months, given its outbreak is ongoing.  Far-off tourist locations, famed for their hot climates and crystal-clear oceans, were also on the list - Barbados (18), the Bahamas (6), Antigua and Barbuda (4), Jamaica (3) and the Dominican Republic (3).  Some had been reported more often than close-by countries like Belgium (4), Malta (1) and Denmark (1).  The data spans several months, in which time the spread of the disease has altered drastically. It was first centered in Asia, before moving to Europe, and now the Americas.  But despite the coronavirus first emerging in China, a mere three of almost 23,000 patients said they had been there in the two weeks before they developed symptoms.  And similarly fewer than ten patients reported travel to Thailand and the Philippines, where Covid-19 first spread to from China.  Very few countries were on the original list of 'high-risk' Covid-19 hotspots that were identified by the Government in February.  At the beginning of February any travellers coming back from Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Macau and mainland China, were advised to call NHS 111 if they felt even slightly unwell.  The Government said they nine countries had been 'identified because of the volume of air travel from affected areas, understanding of other travel routes and number of reported cases'.  Six NHS hospital patients said they had returned from Japan, four from Singapore and Malaysia each, and only one each from South Korea and Hong Kong.  But no patients revealed they came from Taiwan, Macau, Vietnam or Japan. There may be fewer cases reported from those countries given how far away they are from the UK.  On top of this, it's unlikely any Britons travelled there after repatriations brought swathes of citizens back to the UK in January and February - all the while people were still freely travelling in and out of Europe.  But it may also be as a result of missing data - several other hospital patients may have visited one of those early hotspots but it has not been noted down.  Conversely, the Government's announcement in early March that people from France, Spain and Germany were not to be considered at-risk of having coronavirus has not aged well.  Official advice changed on February 25 to tell anyone feeling ill after coming home from northern Italy to self-isolate – at the time the country had 229 diagnosed cases.  In contrast, Asian countries warned of by the Foreign Office had only dozens of cases at the time.  Holidaymakers returning from Cambodia, for example, were told to self-isolate if they feel ill even though the country only had two confirmed cases.  The same went for Vietnam, which had 31 cases, and Thailand, which had 53."

Decarbonisation. Putting progress in climate action at par with measuring GDP. Creative capacity.  These phrases have been running through conversations these days around changing Southeast Asia's template for development in the post-Covid era. While answer to when, and if, the post-Covid era will come remains uncertain, it is clear that sustainability is back in centre stage -- no longer as the hip slogan of the 90s -- but as a survival need.  In many a webinar, experts say health security and the ability to respond to pandemics have become the new competitive advantage. In a high-level dialogue on Asean's post-Covid-19 recovery at end-July, the discussion focused on a more sustainable society, rather than just the economy. No one had to sell the idea of why Southeast Asia needs to pull out of fossil fuels and have broad social protection.  The consensus? Building back better, a mantra these days, means moving on, not returning to the past and choosing a development path that does not lead to our own ruin.  ""Having development and growth and (being) low-carbon do not have to be tradeoff; they can be achieved both"", said Indonesian economist Mari Elka Pangestu, managing director for development policy and partnerships at the World Bank.  ""Any recovery post-pandemic must be green and it must be sustainable"", added Ahmed Saeed, the Asian Development Bank's vice president for East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific. ""This crisis is a reminder to all of us that the problems that are foretold do often come to pass"".  Among the most evident shifts is a recognition that what were often seen as different, unrelated silos were never separate. Health is directly related to economics, trade and investment and to the environment. Public health is connected to wildlife, governance to epidemiology, business to human rights and social protection.  Economists, medical professionals and public officials now discuss investments and fiscal policies, health and food security, digitalisation, energy transition, economic growth and labour migration in the same breath.  Connecting these dots will help countries deal with the hardest aspects of how and when to open economies, adds Mr Saeed. For instance, ""very few groups (previously) had the ability to ""integrate epidemiological and economic forecasting models"", but this capacity is now crucial to recovery.  PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS  But Southeast Asia, if we're to look at it as medical patient, does have serious ""pre-existing conditions"" that figure in any recovery from Covid-19 and its health, economic and social damage.  Among its biggest handicaps is in its poor progress in resilience and climate change, responsible production and consumption, evident in the United Nations' regional scorecard for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that tracks compliance toward meeting these global goals by 2030.  Southeast Asia's figures have been moving towards the negative direction in efforts to reduce inequalities and achieve ""peace, justice and strong institutions"". ""It's regressing, not even stagnating,"" Armida Alisjahbana, head of the UN's Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap), said bluntly.  ""Even before Covid-19, this was one of the weakest points (in SDG indicators). We need to put high priority on climate change mitigation as well as adaptation efforts"", she said. Southeast Asia's 11 countries, which include non-Asean member Timor Leste, lag behind in all but two of the 17 SDG goals.  ""Even before the pandemic, Southeast Asia was not on track to achieve the climate related goals of the 2030 Agenda (for sustainable development) and the Paris Agreement (on climate change)"", a UN brief on the impact of Covid-19 pointed out. Yet ""Thailand and Vietnam are among the top 10 countries in the world most severely affected by climate change"", the July report added.  Equally unsettling is the state of Southeast Asia's health systems, in terms of preparedness for pandemics, health coverage and social protection.  ""In terms of health expenditures, it is at the low end -- all countries"", said Ms Alisjahbana, citing the Escap dashboard for Southeast Asia's preparedness for Covid-19. Cambodia had the highest health expenditure at 6.1 percent of GDP, then Vietnam at 5.7%. These figures were just in the average category.  Health expenditure is one of four elements that make up the quality of health systems, apart from the number of doctors, nurses and midwives, and hospital beds. Data on countries' health systems, along with human development and connectivity, comprise the UN's three indicators for pandemic preparedness.  Only three countries, Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia, were in the highest zones of the UN human development index of .804 and above. They fared well, too, in ratios of nurses and midwives per 10,000 people from 2010-2018.  But Cambodia ranked last in ratio of physicians at 1.7 per 10,000 people. Cambodia and Myanmar had the lowest hospital-bed numbers, at 9 and 8 respectively per 10,000 people. Timor Leste ranked first at 59 beds per 10,000 people, ahead of Brunei (27) and Vietnam (26).  The Philippines, though a major exporter of health professionals, was in the lowest zone with only two nurses and midwives per 10,000 people and 10 hospital beds per 10,000 people.  The UN brief calls for long-term solutions by setting up a universal health care system like Thailand's, and widening social protection ""to include all people throughout their lives"".  But Southeast Asia has a long way to go, given that its median index is just 61 out of 100 in the World Health Organization's index of universal health coverage. Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, the Philippines and Timor Leste are listed as ""vulnerable because of weak health systems"" by the UN brief.  Before getting to recovery, Southeast Asia has to manage the two phases before it -- the health emergency and then the protection of livelihoods and human capital. ""You can't talk about recovery without making sure that you get the first two pillars right,"" said Ms Pangestu. ""What you do in the first two pillars actually can impact on the recovery.""  DOWN, DOWN, DOWN  Since March, the region's economic and social figures have only got gloomier.  In the second quarter of 2020, the Philippines' GDP shrank by 16.5 percent, which was the deepest plunge in Southeast Asia, followed by Singapore (13.2 percent) and Thailand (12.2 percent). Indonesia sees its unemployment rate reaching 9.2 percent from 5.28 percent in 2019. Singapore had 2.9 percent unemployment in June, Malaysia 5.4 percent in May.  Yet the real numbers are far greater since many people, especially women, from street vendors to creative professionals, are in informal work, in unregistered businesses. They do not have health and social security benefits.  For instance, unemployment in the Philippines surged to 17.7 percent in April (7.3 million people), from 5.3 percent in January. But an opinion poll by the Social Weather Stations, released in August, showed that 47.7 percent of adults, or 27.3 million people in a country of 108 million, reported being jobless, in July. A total of 21 percent of adult Filipinos, nearly half of the jobless 47.7 percent, said they lost their livelihood during the pandemic.  Informal work makes for nearly 40 to more than 90 percent of total employment in Southeast Asia's developing countries, International Labour Organization and government data show.  While economies will not be functioning fully for years, many post-pandemic actions can get underway now, analysts say.  Government stimulus packages can send clear signals about sustainability, pushing low-carbon alternatives, renewable energy or high-quality sustainable infrastructure such as rail, walking and cycling paths. The UN brief calculates that Indonesia and Brunei can fund ""most or all"" of their stimulus packages if they remove fossil fuel subsidies.  Southeast Asia needs to brace for the unknown.  ""This is a remarkably difficult crisis to forecast,"" Mr Saeed confirmed. ""We can be precise, but we cannot be necessarily accurate about [what] the future looks like,"" adding there has to be ""a great deal of humility about where the future trajectory of events may take us.""  As it is, he said, ""There is this increasing realisation setting in that we may not even have reached the peak of this crisis or its midpoint."""

Advertisement  As its economy is severely affected by the dual impact of COVID-19 and the EU’s withdrawal of Everything But Arms trade privileges, Cambodia should look to India for support.  With 1.3 billion people, India is the world’s second most populous country, and is expected to surpass China to become the world’s largest population​ by 2027. India is obviously a huge potential market for the world. It is now the world’s third largest economy in purchasing parity terms and the world’s fifth largest economy with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $2.87 trillion in 2019. By 2027, India is predicted to become the third-largest economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP.  In the Indo-Pacific, India has emerged as a key player in the regional security architecture. It plays a vital role in preserving a rules-based international order amid the rise of China and a decline of the United States, as well as a new Cold War initiated by the two powers.  India is the fourth largest trading partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The country became ASEAN’s sectoral partner in 1992, dialogue partner in 1996, summit level partner in 2002, and strategic partner in 2012. The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement was signed in 2009 and entered into force in 2010. The volume of trade between India and ASEAN was $142 billion in 2018.  Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter  The upgrade of India’s Look East Policy to the Act East Policy in 2014 under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seen as India’s attempt to enhance its standing as a regional power and to balance China’s growing influence in Southeast Asia. India also aims to improve its cultural and economic integration with countries in Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific at large. In this regard, ASEAN must engage India economically and strategically to ensure a balance of power in the region amid the growing strategic competition between the United States and China.

India’s Act East Policy and its increasing role in Southeast Asia are beneficial for countries in the region, especially Cambodia as it is teetering on the brink of the U.S.-China strategic rivalry for regional influence.  Cambodia has long ties with India dating back to ancient times. India’s culture has strongly influenced Cambodian society, especially in the areas of religion – Hinduism and Buddhism – and language. The Khmer language, for example, has received enormous influence from Sanskrit and Pali. Many of Cambodia’s temple architectures, such as the famed Angkor Wat and Preah Vihear temples, were influenced by religious concepts that originated in India.  In modern times, Cambodia officially established its diplomatic ties with India back in 1952. Cambodia and India were among the architects of the Non-Alignment Movement, which pursued a neutral foreign policy during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. This historical movement has allowed the two counties to forge good ties; Cambodia should build on these connections today.  Advertisement  Remarkably, India was the only country from the free world that recognized the Vietnamese-installed People’s Republic of Kampuchea after the collapse of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 by reopening its embassy in Phnom Penh in 1981. More significantly, India was one of the signatory states of the 1991 Paris Peace Agreement that, in general terms, ended a prolonged civil war in Cambodia.  In the current context of the Act East Policy and India-ASEAN relations, India considers Cambodia as an important interlocutor and a good partner.  Economically, India is one of the top 10 foreign investors in Cambodia, although it remains far behind leader China. In 2016, India invested $19.8 million in Cambodia; China invested $3.6 billion the same year. India’s investments concentrate on agriculture, energy, machinery, construction, and mining. Cambodia-India trade reached $249.92 million in 2019, with Cambodia’s exports to India worth $82.09 million and its imports from India $167.83 million Additionally, the number of Indian tourists to Cambodia reached 65,882 in 2018 – a 10.6 percent increase from the previous year.  What is more, India has been providing various forms of aid and assistance to Cambodia. Quick Impact Projects, which is at the core of India’s aid program to Cambodia, focuses on social development, gender empowerment, and the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. Each year, India provides 25 scholarships to Cambodian students to pursue higher education in India and offers short capacity building programs for Cambodian government officials.  To support Cambodia’s demining efforts, India donated 15 sniffer dogs in 2016. It recently provided $1.5 million worth of demining equipment to assist Cambodia’s peacekeeping operations. India has been one of the original contributors to Cambodia’s national budget for the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), also known as the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, since its establishment in 2006. Under the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC), India has helped Cambodia to build the MGC Asian Traditional Textiles Museum in Siem Reap and offered training courses on conservation and preservation to the museum staff.  Considering India’s role in Southeast Asia in general and its role in Cambodia in particular, it is imperative for Cambodia to look westward and increase its engagement with India. In times of increasing uncertainty caused by the U.S.-China competition and the COVID-19 crisis, as well as the economic slowdown triggered by COVID-19, Cambodia needs to deepen its relations with India.  Cambodia should play a more proactive role to engage India. At the government-to-government level, Cambodia can learn from India in terms of democratic development. Since India is one of the most stable post-colonial countries in South Asia as well as the world’s largest democracy, Cambodia as a post-conflict country can benefit from the lessons and experiences that India has gone through. The lessons learned can be used to build democracy, enhance the capacity of political institutions, and promote the rule of law in Cambodia.  Enjoying this article?

In the area of trade and investment, Cambodia, having concluded a free trade agreement (FTA) with China, should constructively engage India and find ways to seal an FTA with this Asian giant. Cambodia must recognize the significant role of India in the region, especially when it comes to balancing China’s influence and growing aggressiveness in different dimensions.  To engage India meaningfully, Cambodia should look for alternative ways to create a conducive environment for Indian investors to increase their investments in Cambodia. Taking advantage of India’s 1.3 billion people is obviously the way forward for Cambodia, which is seeking to diversify its export markets after the European Union’s partial withdrawal of the Everything But Arms (EBA) trade scheme that Cambodia has enjoyed since 2001.  As the world enters the Fourth Industrial Revolution and embraces a digital economy, Cambodia needs to improve its technological capacity to stay relevant and competitive in the digital era. The country can collaborate with India to enhance its technology transfer and adoption because India has long been known as the world’s leading outsourcing destination for major technology companies.  Advertisement  To boost people-to-people engagement, Cambodia needs to proactively engage India to enhance various forms of collaboration and interactions. Cambodia can frankly talk to the Indian government about its need for more support to develop its human capital. The Cambodian government can ask India through the Indian embassy in Phnom Penh to provide more scholarships to Cambodian students and government officials. At the moment, India offers about 25 government scholarships to Cambodians per year. This number is low if compared to some 180 scholarships given by the Chinese government to Cambodians annually.  Moreover, since the number of Indian tourist arrivals in Cambodia is still low, just 1.1 percent of the total of 6.2 million international tourists in 2018, Cambodia should try to attract more Indian tourists. Opening a direct flight between the two countries can be an option. Cambodia should also try to promote cultural tourism aimed at attracting Indian tourists as the two countries have shared long cultural and historical connections. It is worth noting that thousands of Cambodians visit religious sites in India every year. Cambodia, as home to the world’s largest religious temple, needs to come up with innovative ways to attract more Indian people to visit the Angkor Wat temple and other tourist sites.  As its economy is severely affected by the dual impact of COVID-19 and the EU’s EBA withdrawal, Cambodia should look to India for support. The country can engage India to reduce its dependence on China. Given India’s economy, geography, population, and power, Cambodia would be wise to increase its India engagement. Having two Asian giants – China and India – as friends is clearly better than putting all eggs in the Chinese basket.  In sum, through historical, cultural, and economic ties, Cambodia can deepen and take its relations with India to new heights. Cambodia has to bring in the Indian card to balance China’s economic and geopolitical influence in Cambodia as well as in Southeast Asia, which is causing concerns among ASEAN members and Cambodia’s key partners such as Japan, the European Union, and the United States.  As India can play a pivotal role in strengthening multipolarity in the region and India’s rise seems to be inevitable, Cambodia must step up to engage India now and in the future to take advantage of the opportunities that the forthcoming Indian rise has to offer.

Following his meeting with Marape in Port Moresby, Motegi told reporters in a virtual news conference that they also confirmed the importance of the “free and open maritime order based on the rule of law for the peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region.”  Motegi, however, did not explicitly refer to China’s growing assertiveness in the East and South China seas in his comments to reporters.  “The cases of infections in Papua New Guinea are small but the country has been impacted economically by the coronavirus. Amid this situation, I conveyed to Prime Minister Marape Japan’s strong support for Papua New Guinea,” Motegi said.  He said the two sides would work on details of the assistance. In June, Japan said it would provide a total of ¥1.9 billion ($17 million) in grant aid to help strengthen Papua New Guinea’s medical and health system and its maritime security efforts.  The island nation with a population of about 8.9 million has seen some 350 coronavirus cases with three deaths, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University in the United States.  Motegi and Marape, who took office in May last year, also signed a document promoting bilateral relations in which Tokyo vowed to boost investments in Papua New Guinea.  Motegi is on the first stop of a six-day tour through Tuesday that will also take him to Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. He became the first minister from overseas to visit Papua New Guinea since the coronavirus pandemic took hold.  Due to strict restrictions on movement to curb the spread of the virus, Motegi’s stay in the Pacific island country was limited to a round-trip between the airport and his hotel, located five minutes by car, where the meeting with Marape took place.  Motegi resumed overseas travel this month with recent visits to Britain, Singapore and Malaysia. Before those trips, no Japanese minister had traveled overseas since February due to the pandemic.

Mr Motegi is on a three-day visit to Cambodia. (AFP Photo)  Japan and Cambodia agreed on Saturday to reopen their borders for each other’s expatriates, possibly starting from early September.  However, expats will still be required to observe a 14-day self-quarantine period and take other precautions against the coronavirus.  The agreement came during a meeting between Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen in Phnom Penh, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.  Japan has also decided to ease entry restrictions for foreign students, government sources said on Saturday.  As well, Tokyo intends to fully lift the re-entry ban on foreign nationals who hold resident status as early as next month, according to the sources.  The restrictions for foreign students will first be eased for those sponsored by the Japanese government. It is expected to be later expanded to self-supporting international students.  All foreigners will be required to take polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and prove that they are not infected with the virus when entering Japan, the sources said, adding that they will also be requested to stay in self-isolation for two weeks to monitor their health.  Japan currently denies entry from 146 countries and regions. The denial of re-entry for those with resident status had drawn strong criticism, particularly from the country’s expatriate community, as it effectively prevents them from travelling abroad and returning.  Many other countries that have imposed travel bans do not discriminate between citizens and foreign residents in granting re-entry.  Most foreign students usually come to Japan in the spring and fall, when the school calendar in the country begins.  But many of them could not enter Japan this past spring as the government sharply increased the number of countries designated for entry restrictions in early April, in response to the global pandemic.  Besides foreign residents, who are allowed to re-enter Japan under certain conditions, the relaxation of the restrictions has so far only applied for those on business trips.  The Japanese government has recently decided to accept business travelers from 16 countries, including Thailand and Vietnam."

The meeting will be co-chaired by Premier Li and Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith of Laos, the LMC Co-Chair, and attended by Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, President U Win Myint of Myanmar, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha of Thailand, and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc of Vietnam.

State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh will attend the event.  CCTV: You announced that Premier Li Keqiang will attend the third Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Leaders' Meeting. How does China see the current Lancang-Mekong cooperation and what does China expect from this meeting?  Zhao Lijian: China and Mekong countries are good neighbors, partners and brothers. The Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) is a new type of sub-regional framework initiated and advanced by six countries through consultation, collaboration and benefit-sharing. Since its launch more than four years ago, it has achieved rapid progress with improved institution building, expanding cooperation fields and greater impetus for growth, which has brought tangible benefits to people in the six countries. Amid COVID-19, the six countries have been helping each other to effectively contain the virus and contributing to the fight against COVID-19 in East Asia and the world at large. While overcoming the difficulties in the pandemic, we are still engaging in practical cooperation to resume domestic work and production and advance the economic recovery in the region.  This meeting was supposed to take place at the beginning of this year in Vientiane, Laos, but was postponed due to the pandemic. All parties believe it is necessary to hold this meeting in a flexible manner as soon as possible so that it can provide strategic guidance for the LMC under the new circumstances. China attaches high importance to this meeting. Premier Li and leaders of other countries will review cooperation outcomes and experience, and make a comprehensive blueprint for future cooperation especially in the key areas like water resources, connectivity and public health. It will contribute to the well-being of people in the riparian countries and to regional peace, stability and prosperity.  Global Times: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on August 20 submitted a letter to the rotating chair of the UN Security Council for this month to request the triggering of snap-back sanctions as prescribed in Resolution 2231. He claimed that the Security Council will restore all U.N. sanctions on Iran in 30 days. Do you have any comment?  Zhao Lijian: China noted the letter sent by the US. The Permanent Mission of China to the UN already stated China's position. Like we stressed many times, the US unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA means renunciation of its rights as a participant of the deal, and it is in no position to demand enacting the snap-back mechanism. Therefore, participants to the JCPOA and the overwhelming majority of the Security Council members believe that the US demand has no legal basis, and the snap-back mechanism has not been invoked. As I understand, pertinent participants including China, Russia, the UK, France, Germany and Iran have sent letters to the Security Council chair. British, French and German foreign ministers also issued a statement to express opposition to the US move.  The US demand of re-imposition of United Nations sanctions on Iran is nothing but a self-serving political manipulation. The US has walked away from commitments, withdrawn from international organizations and treaties, harmed multilateralism and the authority of the Security Council and undermined international non-proliferation regime. Its move to push for a resolution or send a letter to the Security Council cannot justify its above-mentioned behaviors. On August 14, a US-sponsored draft resolution to extend arms embargo on Iran was put to vote at the Security Council, which was voted against by 13 members unequivocally with only one member voted for it, leaving the US isolated like never before. This fully demonstrates that the US unilateral position runs counter to the wide consensus of the international community and its attempt to sabotage the JCPOA will never succeed. We urge the US to stop going down the wrong path, otherwise it will only meet further opposition.  It takes equal-footed dialogue and candid consultations rather than sanctions, pressuring or even military threat, to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.To uphold the JCPOA and the authority of the UNSCR, maintain the international non-proliferation regime and safeguard regional peace and stability, China stands ready to work with other parties to find a proper solution and move forward the political and diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.  TASS: According to US news portal Axios, US Special Presidential Envoy for Arms Control Marshall Billingslea said that the US has changed its position on China's involvement in the nuclear arms control talks. He said that the Trump administration has abandoned its demand that China should be involved in any nuclear talks. It's now aiming to reach a political accord with Russia to extend the treaty, and then pressure China to join the next talks and eventually a treaty on nuclear arms control. What is your comment on this?  Zhao Lijian: It is our clear and consistent position that China has no intention to take part in a trilateral arms control negotiation with the US and Russia. The extension of the New START Treaty, the important and only existing bilateral arrangement between the US and Russia on nuclear disarmament, bears on not only strategic security between the US and Russia but also global strategic stability. China supports the US and Russia in maintaining dialogue on the New START and extending the treaty for the sake of international peace and security.  In the meantime, as a principle, the country in possession of the world's largest nuclear arsenal has the obligation to fulfill special and primary responsibilities in nuclear disarmament following the consensus of the international community, further drastically reduce its nuclear arsenal, and create conditions for other nuclear weapon states to participate in multilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament.  CNS: A new study released by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says China is targeting top scientific and technological expertise in the US and other advanced nations through its 600 ""talent-recruitment stations"" worldwide. The network is also used by the Chinese military for recruitment, the report claims. It is worth noting that the ASPI study is reportedly partly funded by the US State Department. Does China have any comment?  Zhao Lijian: We have repeatedly responded to the preposterously false reports on China compiled by this so-called institute. Media revelations have already exposed its source of funding and masters behind the curtains. Some in Australia revealed that it has long been receiving funds from the US government and arms dealers, and has been enthusiastic about cooking up and sensationalizing anti-China topics. As a deeply ideological organization that is essentially an anti-China ""vanguard"", the ASPI's academic integrity has come under serious question.  The institute has been widely criticized by people with vision in Australia for what it has done and has long been a laughing stock in the world. We hope and believe that Australia and other countries will be sharp-eyed to distinguish right from wrong, reject the absurd fabrications by such anti-China organizations, and look at China and its development in an objective and rational light.  Reuters: During the US Democratic National Convention which was closed on Thursday night, the Democratic shared their 2020 Party Platform for the upcoming US election. In a change from their 2016 Party Platform, they did not include endorsement for the one-China principle. Given the Republican administration has also taken a hard line on China and Taiwan, is China concerned that this could represent a toughest stance on China from both sides of the US politics?  Zhao Lijian: China has repeatedly made clear our position on the US presidential elections. On the matter you mentioned, China's position on Taiwan remains consistent and clear. The Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive issue between China and the US. The one-China principle is the political foundation of China-US relations and a common consensus of the international community. We urge relevant side to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, and prudently and properly handle Taiwan-related issues.  China hopes that the Democratic and Republican parties in the US can view China and China-US relations in an objective way, and work with China to advance China-US relations featuring coordination, cooperation and stability, which serves the common interests of people in China, the US and the whole world.  Reuters: The Philippines said yesterday that it has lodged a diplomatic protest over what it said the ""illegal"" confiscation by the Chinese of the Filipino fishing equipment. It also protested China's continuing illicit issuance of radio challenges to Philippine aircraft which they say were conducting ""legitimate"" maritime patrols in the West Philippine Sea. What is your comment on this?  Zhao Lijian: It is beyond reproach for China Coast Guard to conduct law enforcement in Huangyan Dao waters as it is a lawful practice. The Philippines infringes on China's sovereignty and security by sending military aircraft into air space adjacent to Nansha islands and reefs garrisoned by China. China urges the Philippine side to immediately stop illegal provocations.  Reuters: According reports, Chinese workers who had been given an experimental Chinese COVID vaccine were denied entry to Papua New Guinea. Is the Foreign Ministry aware of this and do you have a comment?  Zhao Lijian: I am not aware of the situation you mentioned.  I would like to stress again that China's vaccine research and development strictly follows science-based and standardized procedures, and there's strict safety and effectiveness evaluation and ethical review. At the same time, in accordance with legal provisions and international common practices, emergency use of vaccines may be carried out on voluntary basis after scientific evaluation, verification and legal review so as to safeguard people's health to the greatest extent.  The following question was raised after the press conference: US Special Presidential Envoy for Arms Control Marshall Billingslea, in an interview with a Japanese media outlet, stated that the US intends to discuss the deployment of land-based medium-range missiles with some Asian countries. Do you have a response?  Zhao Lijian: We noted relevant reports.  The US attempt to deploy land-based medium-range missiles is consistent with its increasing military presence in the Asia Pacific and so-called ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" over the past years, a typical demonstration of its Cold War mentality. Through its words and deeds the US has severely undermined regional and global peace and security, impacted international arms control and disarmament process, undercut mutual trust between major countries and eroded global strategic stability, which is detrimental to others and itself.  China firmly opposes US plan to deploy land-based medium-range missiles in the Asia Pacific and deplores its frequent moves to pressure China's neighbors and blatant provocations at China's doorstep. We urge the US to follow the trend of the times, behave in a responsible way and do things conducive to regional and world peace and stability rather than doing the opposite. If the US is bent on going down the wrong path, China is compelled to take necessary countermeasures to firmly safeguard its security interests.  We also call on countries in the Asia Pacific region to be soberly aware of the true intention behind and severe consequences of the US move, and refrain from acting as a pawn for the US.

The region’s cotton has brought income to one of China’s most impoverished and isolated areas and linked it to the outside world, while providing affordable clothing for Western consumers.  AD  AD  But the flow of Western cash has taken on darker implications as human rights abuses in the region have come to light, and with Xinjiang’s cotton income contributing to China’s construction of a network of surveillance technologies and internment camps targeting Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities. Global supply chains have become so complex that many American companies are struggling to verify how much of their raw materials are sourced from the region, and under what labor conditions.  Last month, the Treasury Department announced sanctions on the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), the paramilitary group often described as a “state within a state.”  The sanctions were overshadowed by President Trump’s announcement the same day of a ban on Chinese video app TikTok. But the cotton restrictions probably will have broader economic repercussions; XPCC produced about one-third of China’s cotton last year, while Xinjiang overall accounts for almost one-fifth of global production, according to official figures and calculations by The Washington Post.    “It’s a concern that it could even affect apparel coming from other countries, like Vietnam or Cambodia or Bangladesh,” said Nate Herman, senior vice president of policy at the American Apparel and Footwear Association. “That could conceivably be made with cotton or yarn from XPCC.”  AD  AD  Cotton textiles produced globally in 2019 were valued at almost $380 billion, or more than a quarter of the overall textile market, according to Grand View Research. About 26.8 million metric tons of cotton were produced last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The sanctions have brought the issue to a head for the fashion industry at a difficult time. A number of retailers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy amid the coronavirus pandemic, including J.Crew, J.C. Penney, Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor’s parent company, Ascena Retail Group.  The Treasury sanctions prohibit U.S. companies from buying from or selling to XPCC or subsidiaries where it has a majority stake. The sanctions won’t prohibit the use of suppliers that source cotton from XPCC, but Washington is warning U.S. companies of business in Xinjiang more broadly: The State Department issued a supply chain advisory last month that said factories in Xinjiang may have an elevated risk of forced labor. It is illegal to import products made with forced labor into the United States.  Problem of 'unprecedented' scale  Over the past three years, a heavy-handed Chinese anti-extremism campaign has swept an estimated 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into what the government calls “re-education centers.” Satellite images show these high-security compounds are similar in layout to prisons, and former detainees have alleged they were subject to torture.  AD  AD  Many detainees were placed at textile factory jobs in Xinjiang upon their release, according to official reports. Local officials say it is voluntary work for rehabilitated criminals, although some workers have alleged they were threatened with detention if they refused.  In March, the Retail Industry Leaders Association called the issue “of a scale, scope and complexity that is unprecedented during the modern era of global supply chains.”  Some brands are giving Xinjiang a wide berth. PVH Corp., which owns the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands, said it plans to end all business relationships with factories that use cotton grown in Xinjiang in the next 12 months. Nike issued a statement saying its suppliers do not use textiles or spun yarn from the region.  The Chinese trade publication Cotton China reported this month that domestic textile manufacturers were being asked frequently by U.S. buyers whether they used Xinjiang cotton, with some customers requiring imported cotton. It said the XPCC sanctions had “severely affected” the country’s cotton-spinning industry.  AD  AD  The U.S. cotton industry — the third-largest by output after India and China — has been a beneficiary. China imported large quantities of U.S. cotton this year as part of the countries’ trade agreement.  China Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said this month that Beijing would retaliate if the United States did not withdraw the sanctions. XPCC and Xinjiang’s Communist Party propaganda department did not respond to requests for comment.  A subtropical crop moved  to the steppes  A cousin of the hibiscus, hollyhock and okra, cotton is an ancient, shrubby plant that produces ruffled flowers ranging from pale yellow to pink. After several days’ bloom, the flowers wither, leaving pods called bolls that dry in the sun until they split to reveal globes of snowy cellulose: cotton.  AD  Native to hot, humid climates, cotton only became a widespread crop in the harsh Xinjiang expanses as part of a Chinese government plan to develop the region’s economy. Subsidies were so successful in shifting the nation’s cotton industry inland that last year, almost 85 percent of China’s cotton was grown in Xinjiang, according to official figures.  But it wasn’t subsidies alone that established Xinjiang’s cotton industry. Former residents, including Ilshat Hassan, a Uighur activist who now lives in Virginia, recall that until 2008, not only adult residents but also elementary and middle-school students across Xinjiang were required by the government to help pick the cotton crop each year.  AD  “It was called labor education,” said Hassan, 58, who said that as a local teacher he brought his students to pick cotton each year. “Each student had a daily quota of 45 kilograms [100 pounds].”  AD  Xinjiang moved away from student cotton-picking more than a decade ago, with improving mechanization and pressure from human rights groups. But the issue of forced labor in the region has resurfaced with China’s internment of Uighurs and other minorities.  As a local government body as well as a company, XPCC has come under international scrutiny for its role in building and running some re-education camps, as documented by local government notices and construction bids.  The XPCC sanctions followed a concerted push by a coalition of more than 190 organizations to urge major fashion brands to stop using Xinjiang cotton, and for international auditing firms to stop working with factories in the region.  Penelope Kyritsis, assistant research director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a member of the coalition, said five international auditing firms have agreed to stop conducting factory audits in Xinjiang because of government pressure on workers that prevents them from speaking freely.  AD  AD  Brian Finnegan, global worker rights coordinator of the AFL-CIO, said the coalition has sought to work with fashion brands in this push, based on previous successful experience in lobbying retailers to stop using cotton from Uzbekistan because of forced-labor concerns. The AFL-CIO is the largest federation of unions in the United States and a member of the coalition.  “The lesson learned from Uzbekistan is really keeping a dialogue with the companies and appearing with the companies,” Finnegan said.  For retailers, it will be a challenge to simply map out the thousands of companies in which XPCC holds a stake, to check that they aren’t dealing with one controlled by the organization.

Amazing is how one might term singer Reuben Laurente’s professional voyage onstage aboard the many cruise ships he has taken.  What others may never reach or see in their lifetime, Laurente has accomplished everything after only a decade. He started his cruise ship stint in 2008, when the international cruise company, Royal Caribbean International, came to Manila to conduct auditions for dancers and singers.  As he became one of the Asian artists who joined the growing international cast of singers and dancers of the cruise ship, Laurente, tagged as Manila’s Pop Virtuoso, had the chance to visit every imaginable destination around the globe.  “I auditioned for the part of a featured singer for production shows and was blessed to get the part, along with Anna Fegi-Brown and Roy Rolloda,” Laurente shared. “I was doing various shows ranging from pop, dance, musical theater, jazz, popera, name it. The ship has got that in their themed shows. I did that for 10 years onboard ships from the Royal Caribbean’s fleet.”  While he basked on his rewarding job contract, Laurente understandably became scarce in the local entertainment scene and the music industry. “Much as I would still like to connect with the industry, my work did not allow me to because I had to fulfill contracts between six to nine months in a year,” he said.  Still, Laurente considered it a blessing that in between contracts, he was able to record his fourth and fifth albums, respectively. “Heart Blends” was released under MCA-Universal Philippines in 2009 and “More Than Just Renditions” came out in 2012 under Musikatha Music Ministries.  While on board the cruise ships, Laurente had to battle homesickness, being away from his immediate family and even the local music industry. “It was just an awesome thing that I was mostly around Filipinos who were there as your family,” he said. “Plus, there’s always Facebook and Skype to lessen that homesickness.”  Laurente attests it is never easy being away from home and “living in a floating hotel” as a performer. “You’re the face of the company, so you always had to be at your best in your performances and in dealing with guests, even if you felt low at times,” he explained.  “Another way of conquering homesickness was being part of a ‘pat on the back' team, being with the right people whom you can talk to and whom you can be yourself with. More importantly, I know I have the Lord with me and I am abreast of the scriptures because that really helped me big time.  “I would always claim that I was overwhelmingly victorious and more than a conqueror (Romans 8:37) in whatever situation, because ‘if God is with us, who can be against us?’ (Romans 8:31).”  GOSPEL SINGER  Laurente started his singing career at the same time he entered college at the University of the Philippines in 1986. After winning third prize in a gospel singing contest hosted by the late Ronald Remy and his daughter, Jackie Kookoorithchkin, Laurente became a gospel singer for the inspirational show, “The Essential Christ,” hosted by Ramon and Cita Orosa.  “At that time, I was also asked by [Bro.] Ramon Orosa to perform at their Christian-themed restaurant, Sign of the Dove, where I entertained guests singing gospel songs,” Laurente recalled. “That was where [Sir] Butch Lagdameo, [Bro.] Ramon’s son-in-law, saw me and he asked me to perform at Joanne Lorenzana’s concert at the same venue.”  Reuben Laurente  Singing gospel songs was nothing new to Laurente. In 1981, he was one of the grand finalists of “Tagis-Himig,” a gospel singing contest that aired over at DZAS 702-AM. “I was 11 then and the contest was kind of a ticket to a recording opportunity and become a Papuri! singer,” Laurente said.  Papuri!, being the music arm of the Far East Broadcasting Company, opened doors for Laurente to spread his musical wings. He placed third to now Papuri! gospel royalty Cindy Del a Paz-Lacanilao and Cynthia Capecete-De la Cruz. That also led him to becoming a Papuri! singer.  “Later in 1986, I did a gospel recording, ‘Totoo,’ for composer Butch Charvet, along with two other gospel singers – Lea Carlos and Honey Lopez-De Vera,” Laurente recalled. “It was aired on DZAS and little did the Papuri! committee [Papuri! icons Romy Dinglas, Maru Cepeda-Javier and host Efren Pallorina] know that this was how the former boy soprano sounded then and the rest is history.”  Laurente interpreted his first Papuri! song, “Bakit Ako Mangangamba,” penned by Cesar Aniceto. It was a duet with April Ricafrente for the album, “Papuri! 9,” released in 1987.  THE COMPANY  Then came his 13-year stint with the Philippines’ premier vocal sextet, The CompanY, a chapter in Laurente’s professional life that he tagged as “the most fulfilling,” in his growth as an artist.  “In a person’s life, you would know for yourself that you needed to turn another page and start another chapter,” he maintained. “Moy [Ortiz], as the artistic/musical director/leader of the group, has instilled in me a special discipline as a solo artist that I am still making use of up to this day.  “I would always remember Moy saying, ‘rebel against mediocrity’ and that is why every single thing that I lay my hands on, I make sure I give my personal best. After all, I’m always in pursuit of excellence which the Lord, the Giver of this talent, only deserves.”  The youngest among five children, Laurente was born and raised in Manila. Both his parents are from Iloilo, hence, he is Ilonggo at heart, along with his four other siblings – Grace, Allyn, Ruel and Diane. His dad, Dominador, passed away in 2004, while his mom, Gilda, is turning octogenarian on August 28.  Although both his parents can carry a tune – his father was even a harmonica player and the vocalist of their combo back in Iloilo – it was Laurente’s mom who taught him his first songs, “Matud Nila” in Tagalog and Larry Miranda’s “Sapagkat Mahal Kita.”  “It was both of them who believed in me and encouraged me to just sing and perform like it was my swan song always, so I could give my all and my personal best in any singing engagement,” Laurente fondly remembered.  Then, he patiently did the rounds of singing contests on TV in the early ‘80s. Nothing ever discouraged Laurente. He was always ready to face the musical battle head on, winning in some, losing in some.  Reuben Laurente  “It was my mother who taught me how to sing, but it was my father who pushed and accompanied me to audition for ‘Student Canteen’ [daily winner], ‘Bagong Kampeon’ [weekly winner and challenger], ‘Superwheel Search for Singing Star’ [weekly winner] in the show, ‘Sali Kami,’ hosted by Helen Gamboa and [Senator] Tito Sotto in 1985 and ‘Talent Search’ [monthly winner], hosted by Nestor De Villa and Nida Blanca in 1984.”  Laurente completed his Bachelor in Interior Design degree from the University of the Philippines Diliman. Finishing college also proved to be tough for him, as he shuttled between performing and going to school. “I would love to be an architect then, but I know myself well and math was my waterloo,” he disclosed.  “I would not say Interior Design was the next best choice as I never applied for Architecture in college. My father was a graphic artist, an illustrator and I obviously took after him. I love Interior Design as it encompasses color, form, line, pattern, texture and putting it altogether in a space and design composition where each element complements the other.”  BANNER YEAR  As he has been performing through the years, Laurente has been blessed with awards and nominations that he considers important moments for him. In 1999, 2001 and 2007, he was nominated for Best Male Recording Artist of the Year in the Awit Awards, an award that remains elusive for him.  However, 2007 was like a banner year for him as a solo artist. “It was as if I scored a grand slam because I won an Awit as a singer and a co-writer [Best R & B Song along with Architect Markel Luna], an Aliw for Best Male Performer in Hotels and Lounges, and a CMMA (Catholic Mass Media Award) for Best Pop Album of the Year for my 2006 album ‘Pop Virtuosity,’ co-produced by D’Concorde Records.  “In 2010, I was given a Global Pinoy Award by the SM Supermalls for being an OFW Filipino entertainer. In 2011, I was awarded a special citation, with Anna Fegi-Brown, for being Filipino entertainers who champion the international cruise entertainment industry.  “More recently, I was awarded by Aliw the 2018 Best Male Concert Artist of the Year and the 2019 Best Crossover Artist [Male Category]. I can only thank the Lord for these blessings. Glory is His.”  DIGITAL ALBUM  While the entertainment industry is still reeling from the sweeping impact of this pandemic, Laurente did not wait for COVID-19 to taper off to record his first digital album, “Milestone.” Purposely, he did not even delay the recording at this time.  “The plan has been in the back burner for nearly two years now,” he granted. “A very good friend of mine, Arnold Santiago, who partly owns the events venue, Gazebo Royale, expressed his willingness to produce the album because he believes in me as an artist and in my craft. Hence, GRMilestone Records was born.  “We pushed through with recording the tracks for ‘Milestone’ because we believe that if we’re able to bring this to completion, it would affect people positively. It’s something that would entertain and inspire at the same time. An album that can possibly uplift the spirits amidst this pandemic.”  Laurente’s sixth solo album, “Milestone” celebrates his 34th year in the music industry. “That, in itself, is a milestone,” he proudly stated.  Although there is no title track in the album, the 10-track digital outing contains seven originals and three revivals. According to Laurente, the album complements the tagline of Gazebo Royale, which is “Celebrate milestones in your life.”  “The reimagined songs are ‘Someone To Watch Over Me’ by brothers George and Ira Gershwin, an a cappella where I recorded all the parts and arranged by co-former The CompanY member, André Castillo and the song is our homage to our beloved The CompanY;  ‘Di Na Muling Mag-iisa’ by Gines Tan will be one of the duet cuts in the album with gospel music and theater diva Tricia Amper-Jimenez [‘diva’ expressed as a woman with extraordinary talent and not the nasty definition]; and ‘Sandaling Pinakahihintay’ by Professor Augusto Espino of the UP College of Music. The song is a special request by the producer himself and one that I dedicate to our Creator.”  Meanwhile, the seven original songs came from Laurente’s friends in the industry who, in one way or another, played a significant role in his career as an artist. The composers are Nathanael Arnel De Pano, Jungee Marcelo, Soc Villanueva, Jonathan Manalo, Markel Luna, Jasmine Aquino and the team of Edith Gallardo and Babsie Molina.  The arrangers are the father and son team of Henry and Rush Garcia, based in Chicago (Illinois), former The CompanY Andre Castillo (based in Maryland), gospel music producer Kahlil Refuerzo, gospel concert musical director Eboy Refuerzo, former NeoColours member Niño Regalado, Manila Symphony Orchestra and Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra orchestrator Naldy Rodriguez, Loud Box Studios’ Gino Cruz, choral music advocate De Pano and Studio Z’s Paulo Zarate.  Session vocals were arranged and performed by Laurente’s good friend, Zebedee Zuñiga, who’s also part of the iconic vocal quartet, The Opera. The other duet (by Jonathan Manalo) is with Laurente and Lani Misalucha.  “I am just grateful everyone included in this project said yes to this album,” Laurente allowed “I cannot thank them all enough. It’s actually like a music festival. It’s a musical celebration encapsulated in one album.”  PANDEMIC  Before the pandemic broke out, Laurente was fortunate enough to be repatriated in the nick of time from the international cruise ship last February. As a talent of the Miami, Florida-based Don Casino Production, he was contracted for a solo show as headliner on board the Westerdam (Holland America Line), from January 31 to February 11.  “When the pandemic broke out, we were rumored to have boarded guests that had the virus,” Laurente recalled. “I went on performing my shows, although we were not able to reach to any of our ports of destination, including Manila. We were blessed that Cambodia allowed the guests to disembark. Incidentally, there were no COVID-19 cases in that ship.”  Laurente laments how this pandemic turned out to be a different downside of being a cruise performer. “Everyone in the world is experiencing and going through something because of this,” he explained. “I have not been working since February on board ships, though I had my last singing stint last March for Casino Filipino.  “I would consider it a favor that I am home with my family, enjoying my time with them and making it a point to be productive every single day. Either I am filming myself doing song posts for Facebook, while I also upload them on YouTube or painting to my heart’s content.  “I know that in my own way, I can reach out to and touch someone’s heart through the messages of the songs that I share with them. More importantly, these posts have been instrumental for me personally in trying to keep everyone encouraged and somehow inspired.”  Being jobless this pandemic has taught Laurente valuable lessons. Admittedly, it was hard accepting the fact that his performances on ships have been cancelled until later this year. Yet, he has learned to accept his fate and, in fact, allowed God to take charge of everything for him.  “It has been hard emotionally and mentally, but you can always choose to look up to God and accept thing as they come, however hard and painful the truth is,” Laurente maintained.  “I have been acknowledging everything as God’s perfect plan for me and for all of us, to realize things and how we should put our trust fully in Him, who is Jehovah Jireh, the great Provider, Jehovah Rapha the God who heals and that our God is always there – Jehovah Shammah.  “This pandemic has taught me to be more patient in waiting until this is all over and being prayerful, seeking for wisdom and for sound mind and not be scared. Amid this pandemic, we can say, nowhere to go but up, and when I say up, I say that we can do this because we can be more than conquerors.  “Let’s always choose to do good, take the high road and take the extra mile to do what right and what is praise-worthy. Let’s be of encouragement and know that our Father is the God of possibility. He knows and we will just obey and take heed.”  PAINTING  The past few months while he was merely at home, Laurente rediscovered another potential, career-making gift apart from his voice. Lately, he has been painting images to keep him preoccupied. As early as when he was only five years old, he started drawing images, then shifted to painting in watercolor by the time he was 11.  Reuben Laurente and his paintings  He proudly joined inter-school competitions as representative for district level, on-the-spot painting contest. Later, he competed in Manila-wide inter-school contests.  “In college, part of our requirements was working on our plates design problems that were carried out through submission of working plans with rendered perspective drawings,” he shared. “Those were my training experiences, which is why I was not afraid to hold a paint brush, use acrylic and paint on a canvas even if I never had any formal lesson in painting.  “That gift was unlocked during this pandemic. The last time I painted was in 2013, when I was beginning to lose my voice in one of my cruise contracts. We were in Hobart, Australia every week and there I found a huge art shop where I bought my brushes, colors and canvases.”  Painting, apparently, has also been therapeutic for Laurente. “I am just happy that aside from singing, painting keeps me happy and sane, as this is an amazing way of using your time productively while exercising your imagination in expressing your creativity.”  Laurente loves Filipino themes. “I am an advocate of propagating our cultural heritage, be it in music or the visual arts,” he said. “My images are usually paying homage to the Filipina and celebrating her beauty wherever in the Philippines she is, from and whatever festivity she is engaging herself into.”  His nieces – Bethany, Bethel, and Beulah – willingly stand as his usual muses, although he is even looking forward to painting other muses when this pandemic is over. Recently, he was able to sell two of his art works and that proved to be helpful to him.  He has just finished his seventh work titled, ‘Manila Carnival Queen,” before the general community quarantine was again declared. “Lord willing, I’d be able to gather some more for a possible exhibit with a working title, ‘Quarantine Series,’ which is a better title, I guess, than ‘Lockdown Series,’” he said.  Laurente has always managed to unleash the artist in him wherever he is. He may be performing onstage or painting on canvas. Whatever it is, he always keeps a positive attitude.  Back when he was only 11, joining one singing competition after another, up to this day, Laurente has consistently maintained an indomitable spirit that allows him to bravely face whatever is at stake before him, pandemic or not."

A New York Times investigation found evidence that government employees were involved in the creation and posting of the videos on Facebook.  First, grainy videos appeared on a fake Facebook page, claiming that he had slept with three sisters and their mother. Then a government-controlled religious council defrocked the monk for having violated Buddhist precepts of celibacy. Fearing imminent arrest, the monk fled Cambodia, destined for a life in exile, like so many people who have stood up to Asia’s longest-governing leader.  BANGKOK — In just four days, the reputation of a Buddhist monk who had spent decades fighting for the human rights of Cambodians was destroyed.  Advertisement  His downfall shows how repressive governments can move with stunning speed to disgrace their opponents, using social media and technology to amplify their divisive campaigns. Under Prime Minister Hun Sen, the Cambodian government has repeatedly used falsified Facebook posts or manipulated audio to defame and imprison politicians, activists, and other human rights defenders.  Facebook has come under fire in the United States for disseminating hate speech and disinformation.  It has been criticized for failing to detect Russian influence in the 2016 election, providing a platform for conspiracy theories, and allowing false claims about the coronavirus to proliferate.  But its influence is even greater in such places as Cambodia, where the social media platform is the only digital interface for millions of people. Since civil liberties are often constricted in such countries, Facebook can be a powerful tool for autocrats to bolster their grip on the state, even as it provides a rare space for free expression and activism.  Advertisement  During his nearly 35-year rule, Hun Sen — a onetime soldier for the genocidal Khmer Rouge and now an enthusiastic Facebook user — has decimated Cambodia’s political opposition. He has cozied up to China, eschewing aid from the West that was conditioned on improving human rights. Many high-profile activists and opposition politicians have been assassinated, their cases rarely investigated properly.  As scandals proliferate on its platform, Facebook has been criticized for being too slow in removing problematic accounts and pages, many fake. It took almost a month for Facebook to take down the page on which the videos smearing the monk first aired.  “As a company, you would think they would want to be more vigilant and Jnot allow their platform to be misused,” said Naly Pilorge, director of the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights.  “Facebook’s reaction has been like little drops from a sink, so late and so little.”  In a statement about Luon Sovath’s case, Facebook said that it had built up a team in Cambodia to better monitor the local situation.  Last month, Luon Sovath, who is now in Switzerland after receiving a humanitarian visa, was charged in absentia by prosecutors in Siem Reap province with raping one of the sisters, escalating the accusations in the videos.  The sex charges against Luon Sovath, one of Cambodia’s most celebrated activist monks, went viral. Copies of the videos, which purported to show Facebook Messenger calls between the monk and some of the women, were shared widely on the social media platform.  Advertisement  He has denied the rape charges, along with accusations that he had sexual relations with any of the women.  Clues in the videos, uncovered by the Times, also undercut the claims.  An analysis found split-second footage in which personal information of two government employees briefly flashes on screen.  The employees work for the Press and Quick Reaction Unit, a propaganda arm of Cambodia’s Cabinet.  While the Facebook page has been taken down, the videos are still circulating."

This era will be analyzed and debated for decades to come - if not much longer. Market bubbles, over-indebtedness, inequality, financial instability and economic maladjustment - festering for years - can no longer be disregarded as cyclical phenomena. Ben Bernanke has declared understanding the forces behind the Great Depression is the ""Holy Grail of economics"". It's ironic. That the Fed never repeats its failure to aggressively expand the money supply in time of crisis is a key facet of the Bernanke doctrine - policy failing he asserts was a primary contributor to Depression-era financial and economic collapse. Yet this era's unprecedented period of monetary stimulus is fundamental to current financial, economic, social and geopolitical instabilities.  August 18 - Bloomberg (Craig Torres): ""The concentration of market power in a handful of companies lies behind several disturbing trends in the U.S. economy, like the deepening of inequality and financial instability, two Federal Reserve Board economists say in a new paper. Isabel Cairo and Jae Sim identify a decline in competition, with large firms controlling more of their markets, as a common cause in a series of important shifts over the last four decades. Those include a fall in labor share, or the chunk of output that goes to workers, even as corporate profits increased; and a surge in wealth and income inequality, as the net worth of the top 5% of households almost tripled between 1983 and 2016. This fueled financial risks and higher leverage, the economists say, as poorer households borrowed to make ends meet while richer ones shoveled their wealth into bonds… 'The rise of market power of the firms may have been the driving force' in all of these trends, Cairo and Sim write in the paper.""  My analytical framework's ""money"" and credit focus is at times lacking in capturing non-monetary macro factors. To blame the Fed and global central banks for all that ails the world (while a valid starting point) represents a too simplified view of complex dynamics. To be sure, technological innovation and advancement along with ""globalization"" continue to exert momentous influence - arguably at an accelerated pace. Indeed, analysis with technological and globalization trends at its focal point could offer a plausible explanation of many macro developments - to the exclusion of policymaking and finance. As the above Fed research asserts, it is increasingly tempting to deflect blame for inequality upon monopoly power.  Isabel Cairo and Jae Sim's Fed research paper, ""Market Power, Inequality, and Financial Instability,"" is a technical research piece: ""A few secular trends have emerged in the U.S. economy over the last four decades… First, real wage growth has stagnated behind productivity growth over the last four decades and, as a result, the labor income share has steadily declined… Second, the before-tax profit share of U.S. corporations has shown a dramatic increase in the last few decades… Third, income inequality has been exacerbated over the last four decades… Fourth, wealth inequality has also been exacerbated during the last four decades… Finally, the rising household sector leverage has been coupled with rising financial instability…"" ""We develop a real business cycle model and show that the rise of market power of the firms in both product and labor markets over the last four decades can generate all of these secular trends.""  ""In this paper, we quantitatively investigate the role of rising firms' market power in both product and labor markets in explaining the six secular trends. In so doing, we are inspired by Kalecki (1971), who… predicted that the market power of the firms would increase over time and consequently, labor share would fall in the long-run.""  Understandably, Amazon lost money in its initial years. Losses mounted steadily from 1995, jumping to $720 million by 1999, $1.4 billion in the year 2000 and $567 million in 2001. The company posted a 2003 profit of $35 million on revenues of $5.3bn. Net income jumped to $589 million in 2004 (pre-tax $365 million), earnings not exceeded until 2008's $645 million (on revenues of $19.2bn). Amazon reported net income last year of $13.18 billion on revenues of $280.5bn.  What impact did loose monetary policies have on Amazon's evolution to an online retail juggernaut, crushing traditional retailers and online competitors alike? Enjoying limitless access to virtually free finance, there were no constraints on investment spending (or acquisitions). And as competitors increasingly struggled to retain profitability and affordable finance, there was nothing holding back Amazon's rein of dominance.  Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock price closed the week at $2,050, up almost 400% y-t-d, with a market capitalization of $390 billion, exceeding the combined capitalization of five global auto heavyweights (Ford (NYSE:F) $26.7bn, GM (NYSE:GM) $41.0bn, Toyota (NYSE:TM) $218bn, Honda (NYSE:HMC) $45.3bn, and Daimler (OTCPK:DDAIF) $51.8bn). Tesla reported losses of $725 million in 2016, $1.8bn in 2017, $742 million in 2018 and $629 million in 2019. After reporting cumulative profits of about $450 million over the past four quarters, Tesla's stock currently trades with a price/earnings ratio of 895.  How would Tesla appear these days if not for ongoing aggressive Federal Reserve stimulus and the resulting loosest financial conditions imaginable? Would it have survived? I'm all for zero emissions vehicles - as well as a proponent for Schumpeter's ""creative destruction."" But zero rates, QE, mispriced finance and market bubbles have created financial and economic distortions with momentous consequences. Years of ultra-cheap finance, booming securities markets, and a most elongated business cycle have created powerful industry behemoths. Pandemic crisis measures now cement monopoly power.  To be sure, whether it is Amazon, Tesla, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook or scores of other market darlings, a hot stock price is essential to achieving market dominance. For one, it provides a currency for acquisitions, purchases that often include fledgling competitors. And as these companies grow increasingly dominant in both the markets and real economy, surging stock prices ensure these heavyweights attract and retain the best and brightest talent (further cementing competitive advantage).  There is today no more powerful factor in exacerbating inequality than the stock market. A position (with stock grants) at one of the hundreds of market darlings is today a ticket to extraordinary riches. While tens of millions have lost their jobs and financial security over recent months, those fortunate to be riding the bull market wave have enjoyed spectacular wealth gains.  August 20 - Bloomberg (Liz Capo McCormick): ""The unprecedented speed and scale of the Federal Reserve's buying of Treasuries and mortgage debt to aid a severely impaired bond market has accomplished that without raising the specter of moral hazard, Federal Reserve Bank of New York researchers wrote… Pandemic-sparked volatility in March caused liquidity in the world's biggest bond market to plunge to its worst since the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed responded with purchases of Treasuries and mortgage securities that peaked at more than $100 billion a day combined. It's still soaking up about $80 billion of Treasuries and at least $40 billion of mortgage securities a month, and some bond veterans warn that the central bank's involvement in the market could potentially be encouraging risky behavior, such as excessive borrowing. But a post… in the New York Fed's Liberty Street blog argued against that. 'The magnitude of the Desk's purchase program in 2020 'to support the smooth functioning' of the Treasury and agency MBS markets marked those purchases as highly unusual,' wrote Kenneth Garbade, a senior vice president in the New York Fed's Research and Statistics Group, and Frank Keane, a senior policy advisor. But they also say that the tool has been used before and 'the infrequency of Federal Reserve intervention suggests that relying on the Fed on those rare occasions when markets are in extremis has not materially exacerbated moral hazard.""  The Fed's stunning pandemic response has greatly exacerbated at least two pernicious dynamics - Inequality and Moral Hazard. Only Fed economists could argue the Federal Reserve's crisis response measures haven't stoked risk-taking throughout the markets (and in the real economy). Indeed, any doubt that the Fed would invoke ""whatever it takes"" to support the securities markets has been allayed.  It is strangely flawed analysis deserving of a response. ""The magnitude of the Desk's purchase program in 2020 'to support the smooth functioning' of the Treasury and agency MBS markets marked those purchases as highly unusual. From an operational perspective the speed and size of the program were unprecedented, yet as a policy response, as the three episodes discussed here show, it was not unique.""  The Fed economists point to three episodes as evidence recent Fed crisis measures were not unique: 1) Fed purchases of $800 million of Treasuries during September 1939, at the start of WWII. 2) Several hundred million Treasury purchases in response to disorderly markets in July 1958. 3) The buying of several billion Treasury securities in May 1970 in response to disorderly markets after President Nixon announced a military escalation with large-scale operations in Cambodia - along with anti-war protests and the Kent State tragedy. The analysis concludes with a bold assertion: ""…The infrequency of Federal Reserve intervention suggests that relying on the Fed on those rare occasions when markets are in extremis has not materially exacerbated moral hazard.""  Arguably, the three highlighted historical interventions have little or no bearing whatsoever on today's Moral Hazard Quagmire.  I would point to more than three decades of serial - and escalating - market interventions and bailouts - including Greenspan's 1987 post-crash liquidity assurances; early '90s' aggressive rate cuts and yield curve manipulation; 1994 GSE quasi-central bank liquidity operations; the 1995 Mexican bailout; Greenspan's pro-markets ""asymmetric"" policy responses; the '98 LTCM bailout to safeguard global derivatives markets; Bernanke's 2002 ""helicopter money"" and ""government printing press"" speeches; the Fed's post-tech bubble accommodation of rapid mortgage credit growth as the primary system reflation mechanism - and the subsequent blatant disregard for mortgage finance and housing excesses; the post-bubble $1 TN QE program, bailouts and various extraordinary crisis measures in 2008/09; the Bernanke Fed's coercion of savers into the debt and equities markets; Draghi's ""whatever it takes"" 2012 crisis response; Bernanke's 2013 assurance that the Fed would ""push back"" against any market tightening of financial conditions (i.e. market corrections); the Bernanke and Yellen Feds' decade-long aversion to policy normalization; the Powell Fed's abrupt market instability-induced December 2018 abandonment of policy ""normalization""; the September 2019 ""insurance"" rate cut and QE in the face of record stock prices and generally overheated securities markets.  ""Moneyness of Credit"" was an analytical focus of mine during the mortgage finance bubble period. It was a historic Moral Hazard episode, with the government-sponsored enterprises, the Treasury and Federal Reserve all contributing to the perception that federal backing insured mortgage finance would remain safe and liquid (money-like) - irrespective of the risk profile of the underlying mortgages. The view that Washington would never allow a housing (or mortgage finance) bust was fundamental to egregious risk-taking and excess (in both the Real Economy and Financial Spheres).  I coined ""Moneyness of Risk Assets"" in 2009 upon recognizing that Bernanke was targeting rising equities and corporate credit markets as the primary mechanism for post-bubble system reflation. Epic Moral Hazard was unleashed. Markets accurately assumed the Fed had taken a giant leap with respect to market intervention and support - with the greater the degree of bubble excess, the more confident the marketplace became that the Fed wouldn't risk pulling back.  In the realm of Moral Hazard, last autumn's ""insurance"" monetary stimulus was a catastrophic policy blunder. Stress was building in leveraged speculation and within global derivatives markets - air was beginning to leak from the global financial bubble. The Fed's aggressive measures quashed the incipient market correction and stoked only greater speculative excess. This ensured the acute market fragility that contributed to March's near-financial meltdown.  And the financial crisis spurred an unprecedented $3 TN expansion of Fed market liquidity. M2 money supply surged an unparalleled $2.9 TN in only six months, in an ongoing episode of historic Monetary Disorder. And when it comes to Moral Hazard, one cannot overstate the significance of the Fed's giant leap to purchasing corporate bonds and even ETFs that hold junk bonds. With rates back to zero and the Fed now directly backstopping corporate credit, ""money"" has flooded into perceived safe and liquid bond ETFs (in the face of the steepest economic downturn in decades). A debt issuance bonanza ensued.  Once more for posterity: ""…The infrequency of Federal Reserve intervention suggests that relying on the Fed on those rare occasions when markets are in extremis has not materially exacerbated moral hazard.""  Rather than infrequent, Fed intervention has become incessant. Market ""extremis"" has turned commonplace. And any assertion that Fed policies have not materially exacerbated Moral Hazard completely lacks credibility. In fact, it's foolish.

August 18 - Bloomberg (Donal Griffin and Yalman Onaran): ""The pile of the murkiest trades at global banks, long the bane of regulators, got much bigger during Covid-19.

There's no single, clear-cut explanation for the jump in these so-called Level 3 assets. For some, the surge was a natural consequence of pandemic turmoil: safer assets became difficult to price as markets froze, and risk managers had to shunt them into a different category, according to analysts and people familiar with the situation. Others are likely to have added to their riskiest bets after seeing the potential for a windfall in the chaos, said Jerome Legras, managing partner at Axiom Alternative Investments.""

August 17 - Financial Times (Sun Yu and Yuan Yang): ""Amanda Wang's family businesses - a call centre and two restaurants in Beijing - are grappling with a plunge in revenue following the coronavirus outbreak. She imposed a company-wide 30% pay cut on about 120 workers in July even after receiving tax cuts and employment subsidies from the government designed to help companies survive the pandemic. 'My biggest challenge is a lack of business and policy support [from the government] isn't helpful [on this],' says Ms Wang, referring to her decision to cut workers' salaries. 'I have to make savings where I can.' Yet Ms Wang had no qualms about renewing her annual Rmb150,000 ($21,000) membership at a downtown beauty salon in the Chinese capital.

August 18 - Wall Street Journal (Chun Han Wong): ""A senior ally of Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for a Mao-style purge of China's domestic-security apparatus last month, saying it was time to 'turn the blade inwards and scrape the poison off the bone.'

Within the first week after the call to action, Communist Party enforcers had launched investigations into at least 21 police and judicial officials, according to a media tally cited by the party's top law-enforcement commission. Dozens more have since been taken down, including the police chief of Shanghai, the most senior target thus far, and cadres who have won awards for good performance. The rash of investigations marks the first time that Mr. Xi has unleashed a sweeping and systematic clean-up of the country's powerful domestic-security apparatus.

Geopolitical Watch  August 17 - Financial Times (Gideon Rachman): ""When a familiar and comfortable situation changes dramatically, the human instinct is to believe that things will soon get back to normal. The idea that life may have changed permanently is too unsettling to deal with. We are seeing this mentality with Covid-19. We are also witnessing it as business responds to the downward spiral in US-Chinese relations. After 40 years of ever deeper economic integration between the US and China, it is hard to imagine a real severance of ties. Many executives believe that politicians in Washington and Beijing will patch up their differences when they realise the true implications of 'decoupling' the world's two largest economies. The hope is that a trade deal will stabilise things, even if it has to wait until after the US presidential election. But that is too complacent. The reality is that decoupling has much further to go. It is already spreading beyond technology and into finance. In time, it will affect every large industry, from manufacturing to consumer goods.""

Then a government-controlled religious council defrocked the monk for having violated Buddhist precepts of celibacy. Fearing imminent arrest, the monk fled Cambodia, destined for a life in exile, like so many people who have stood up to Asia’s longest-governing leader.  The monk, Luon Sovath, was the victim of a smear campaign this summer that relied on fake claims and hastily assembled social media accounts designed to discredit an outspoken critic of the country’s authoritarian policies. A New York Times investigation found evidence that government employees were involved in the creation and posting of the videos on Facebook.  His downfall shows how repressive governments can move with stunning speed to disgrace their opponents, using social media and technology to amplify their divisive campaigns. Under Prime Minister Hun Sen, the Cambodian government has repeatedly used falsified Facebook posts or manipulated audio to defame and imprison politicians, activists and other human rights defenders.  Facebook has come under fire in the United States for disseminating hate speech and disinformation. It has been criticised for failing to detect Russian influence in the 2016 election, providing a platform for conspiracy theories and allowing false claims about the coronavirus to proliferate.  But its influence is even greater in places like Cambodia, where the social media platform is the only digital interface for millions of people. Since civil liberties are often constricted in such countries, Facebook can be a powerful tool for autocrats to bolster their grip on the state, even as it provides a rare space for free expression and activism.  During his nearly 35-year rule, Hun Sen — a onetime soldier for the genocidal Khmer Rouge and now an enthusiastic Facebook user — has decimated Cambodia’s political opposition. He has cozied up to China, eschewing aid from the West that was conditioned on improving human rights. Many high-profile activists and opposition politicians have been assassinated, their cases rarely investigated properly.  As scandals proliferate on its platform, Facebook has been criticised for being too slow in removing problematic accounts and pages, many fake. It took almost a month for Facebook to take down the page on which the videos smearing the monk first aired.  “As a company, you would think they would want to be more vigilant and not allow their platform to be misused,” said Naly Pilorge, director of the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights. “Facebook’s reaction has been like little drops from a sink, so late and so little.”  In a statement to The Times about Luon Sovath’s case, Facebook said that it had built up a team in Cambodia to better monitor the local situation.  “We recognise the important role that Facebook plays in enabling expression in Cambodia,” the company said. “We want people to feel safe when they’re using our platform, which is why we take reports of impersonation and other violations of our community standards seriously.”  Last month, Luon Sovath, who is now in Switzerland after receiving a humanitarian visa, was charged in absentia by prosecutors in Siem Reap province with raping one of the sisters, escalating the accusations in the videos.  The sex charges against Luon Sovath, one of Cambodia’s most celebrated activist monks, went viral. Copies of the videos, which purported to show Facebook Messenger calls between the monk and some of the women, were shared widely on the social media platform.  He has denied the rape charges, along with accusations that he had sexual relations with any of the women.  Clues in the videos, uncovered by The Times, also undercut the claims.  An analysis found split-second footage in which personal information of two government employees briefly flashes on screen. The employees work for the Press and Quick Reaction Unit, a propaganda arm of Cambodia’s Cabinet.  The videos were uploaded on a Facebook page that assumed the identity of one of the sisters, Tim Ratha, who denied both ownership of the page and any sexual relationship with the monk. The page was created the day the videos were posted and lifted photographs from the sister’s real Facebook account.  A fake Facebook account in the monk’s name was also linked to the videos. It, too, stole images from Luon Sovath’s real account and was established one day before the videos came out.  While the Facebook page has been taken down, the videos are still circulating. The two government employees linked to the production of the videos remain on Facebook, posting makeup tips and animal memes on their timelines.  “We know that Facebook will side with repressive regimes if their bottom line is impacted by freedom-of-expression issues,” said Michael Caster, a human rights researcher who has studied technology use in authoritarian countries.  Facebook said it had nearly tripled its human content moderators in Cambodia, although it would not say how many people worked in Khmer, the local language. From January to March, Facebook said, it took down 1.7 billion fake accounts worldwide.  But none of the tripwires appear to have been triggered in the case of the monk, even as his fate was front-page news in the government-controlled media. Over the years, Luon Sovath said, he has been the repeated victim of fake Facebook accounts set up in his name and reported them to the company. “I want to say to Facebook, you should help to restore and defend human rights and democracy in Cambodia,” he said.  Luon Sovath, 42, was ordained as a monk at age 12. As repression proliferated under Hun Sen, the monk began preaching human rights from his pagoda.  While politicians and activists who spoke up against Hun Sen’s government were jailed, exiled or even killed, Luon Sovath appeared to be protected by his saffron-hued robes. But in elections two years ago, the governing Cambodian People’s Party won every seat in Parliament after the main opposition party was disbanded and its leader imprisoned. The independent news media was eviscerated.  Luon Sovath said he knew he was living on borrowed time. “They went after opposition politicians, NGOs, human rights activists, and now it comes to my turn,” he said.  On May 30, four videos appeared on a Facebook page that had been set up earlier in the day. The page masqueraded as that of Tim Ratha, a 30-year-old nurse whose family has a house and grocery store across the street from the monk’s pagoda. “He is a good and respectful monk,” Tim Ratha said in an interview.  Shortly after the videos appeared on Facebook, police in Siem Reap demanded Tim Ratha report to the station at night, she said. Their questions were rapid-fire and intimidating, she said: Why would you have a sexual relationship with a monk — with your sisters and mother no less? What is your Facebook password? That’s your phone, isn’t it?  Tim Ratha denied everything, even as her voice was shaking from fear, she recalled. “We are just victims,” she said. “We didn’t commit anything wrong.”  The four videos consist of nothing more than fuzzy footage of smartphones with the monk’s fake Facebook profile on the screens. Audio seems to emanate from the phones, as if he is chatting with the women on Messenger.  The conversations in the videos are purportedly between Luon Sovath and Tim Ratha or Som Bopha, her mother. There are a few sexually suggestive references, including an aside about licking.  The monk and the two women said some of the audio is from phone conversations they had. But they say that these chats were edited in a misleading way. The passage about licking, Tim Ratha said, referred to an expression of affection from her dog. And other parts of the audio, all three said, are not them at all, such as references to specific sexual encounters.  “How can a mother and her daughters do such a thing with the same monk?” said Som Bopha. “It is impossible.”  In Switzerland, Luon Sovath said he was adjusting to life in exile. His thin monastic robes are sufficient for summer, but when the snows come his tropical inner thermostat will have to adjust, he said. He keeps to a Buddhist monk’s schedule, fasting after noon and meditating.  “I want to go home,” he said. “But I had no choice to run away from my country and become a refugee.”  c.2020 The New York Times Company"

In Myanmar, military-linked Facebook accounts inflamed hatred of the Rohingya amid the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim ethnic group. Hate speech circulating on WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, fueled anti-Muslim mobs in India. Incendiary rumors about minority Muslims in Sri Lanka spread unchecked on Facebook, leading to fatal riots in 2018. Facebook apologized this year for its role in the Sri Lanka violence.In May, Facebook released the findings of independent human rights assessments conducted in several countries, including Cambodia. Facebook acknowledged that freedom of expression was “severely restricted” in Cambodia and that human rights defenders were jailed for views expressed on social media.“The information environment was dominated by misinformation and rumor,” Facebook said in a summary of the report. “This was exacerbated by state control of the media and cyberwarfare strategies and compounded by low digital literacy.”Facebook said it had nearly tripled its human content moderators in Cambodia, although it would not say how many people worked in Khmer, the local language.

Audio seems to emanate from the phones, as if he is chatting with the women on Messenger.At two points the videos go off script. In one instance, the thumb holding the phone slips for less than a second and pulls up a list of Facebook Messenger friends. Two are brothers of Yeng Sreypoch, one of the employees of the Press and Quick Reaction Unit. Another is her relative, and two more are friends from her hometown. In another video, an online notification from Telegram, the messaging application, appears for a moment, delivered to an account user named “sopheapm.” That name is used on Telegram by Miech Sopheap, the other employee.Miech Sopheap and Yeng Sreypoch declined repeated requests for comment. They are two of the three “friends” of the fake Facebook account in Luon Sovath’s name.Tith Sothea, head of the unit, said in a statement that his office had nothing to do with the videos. “I fervently deny the allegation and the smearing, fabricating,” he said, “that the Press and Quick Reaction Unit set up a Facebook to post alleged videos.”When Tith Sothea took up his job in 2018, local media said his unit was to “carry out media work and react to content with a negative character coming from national and international media.”The Press and Quick Reaction Unit employs a “cyberwar team.”Facebook said that it took down the fake page where the videos appeared on June 27, after a trusted partner reported its existence. Human Rights Watch acknowledged it was that partner.Initially, Facebook said it had punished the creator of the fake Facebook page by removing the administrator’s account. After The Times pointed out that there were two other administrators of the page, Facebook said their accounts were suspended pending further verification.The conversations in the videos are purportedly between Luon Sovath and Tim Ratha or Som Bopha, her mother.

But they say that these chats were edited in a misleading way. The passage about licking, Tim Ratha said, referred to an expression of affection from her dog. And other parts of the audio, all three said, are not them at all, such as references to specific sexual encounters.“How can a mother and her daughters do such a thing with the same monk?” said Som Bopha. “It is impossible.”The three people say they do not know how their private phone conversations went public. Human rights groups say Cambodian authorities regularly harvest phone conversations without people’s knowledge. Tapped or manipulated audio has been used in Cambodian courts to convict the government’s critics.Tim Ratha said a friend of hers reported the fake page to Facebook multiple times over several days. Pilorge, of the human rights group, said her colleagues filed similar complaints. Facebook said it had not received a single user report questioning the veracity of the page.In Switzerland, Luon Sovath said he was adjusting to life in exile. His thin monastic robes are sufficient for summer, but when the snows come his tropical inner thermostat will have to adjust, he said. He keeps to a Buddhist monk’s schedule, fasting after noon and meditating.“I want to go home,” he said. “But I had no choice to run away from my country and become a refugee.”"

The Hawaiian government is hoping to create a trans-Pacific travel bubble with Australia and Japan - among other countries in the Pacific - before the year ends to help the struggling tourism industry.  David Ige, the island state's governor, has long been saying he wanted to reopen his borders after enjoying relatively low coronavirus case numbers.  So far, Hawaii has diagnosed 6,356 COVID-19 cases even without closing the borders to other American states experiencing devastating outbreaks.  Mr Ige said in an August 18 press conference he would ideally like to kickstart the tourism industry again by October 1.  Australians could be able to travel to Hawaii by October 1 if a scheduled travel bubble goes ahead  'I have been working with mayors of all the counties to identify ways we can bring travellers back more quickly,' he said.  One of the ideas floated among leaders is to 'geo-fence' at resorts, which would essentially quarantine people for 14 days in the luxury accommodation.  Properties would take responsibility for ensuring guests didn't leave the resort for at least 14 days in that scenario.  But Mr Ige acknowledged that mightn't be appealing to all tourists, and is considering all other avenues to fire up tourism.`  'We are looking at exploring all options to safely bring trans-Pacific travellers to the island,' he said.  Earlier in the year Mr Ige suggested allowing travellers in if they'd had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of flying, but the plan had to be postponed three times following a spike in case numbers.  It now may form part of the October 1 bubble.  David Ige, the island state's governor, has long been saying he wanted to reopen his borders after enjoying relatively low coronavirus case numbers  Passengers arrive from a Qantas flight that flew from Melbourne at Sydney Airport to be met by health officials taking their temperature  The potential new bubble between Hawaii and Australia comes after Qantas boss Alan Joyce on Thursday announced the airline's international flights will likely resume in July 2021, after the federal government ordered a travel ban in March.  The insight came as Mr Joyce reported the flying kangaroo had lost a whooping $2billion in the 2020 financial year, as the aviation industry reels in the economic fallout of the global pandemic.  But while Aussies can look forward to being back in the air, the list of permitted destinations is expected to remain restricted for some time.  Qantas boss Alan Joyce on Thursday announced the airline's international flights will likely resume in July 2021  Mr Joyce said Qantas' larger aircrafts - such as A380s - will be grounded for years to come, indicating trips on longer flights routes could be further away.  'Most airlines will come through this crisis a lot leaner, which means we have to reinvent how we run parts of our business to succeed in a changed market,' Mr Joyce said during Thursday's trading post.  'We have parked the A380 for at least three years … We have put the 787s in long-term storage which fly transcontinental and we believe the earliest we will see the international borders opening up is the middle of next year.'  Aside from logistical costs, reopening tourism will depend largely on nations' control of local outbreaks.  'The US, with the level of (coronavirus) prevalence there, it is probably going to take some time. There will probably need to be a vaccine before we could see (flights) happening,' Mr Joyce said.  Aviation expert Neil Hansford predicts the Pacific Islands (Palau tropical islands pictured) will be the second destination to open to Australians  Singapore will be the third country Australians will be able to visit when international travel resumes  'We potentially could see a vaccine by the middle or the end of next year, and countries like the US may be the first country to have widespread use of that vaccine. So that could mean that the US is seen as a market by the end of 2021, hopefully we could, dependent on a vaccine, start seeing flights again.'  Australia and New Zealand have been in negotiations to create a trans-Tasman travel bubble since border closures came into effect, a plan indefinitely cancelled earlier this month in light of Auckland's coronavirus outbreak.  But Aviation expert Neil Hansford predicts the neighbouring nation will be the first to open to Australians.  He said the Pacific Islands will be next, followed by Singapore, Japan, Vietnam and Cambodia.  European holidays will then be on the cards, with flights resuming to the UK, then Germany, Scandinavia (except Sweden), and Ireland.  'I think the world understands social distancing of 1.5-2 metres and the opening up won't be universal,' Mr Hansford told news.com.au.  'Africa and South America could be 24-36 months away. Even with a vaccine only wealthy nations populations will be able to afford it and even in Australia to vaccinate all of us within three months would be impossible.  'Once other countries can demonstrate NSW levels, the world will open up.'  New Zealand is tipped to be the first available overseas holiday destination for Australians. A Woman hiker is pictured on mountain cliff in New Zealand's Kepler Track  The UK is forecast to be the seventh place available to Australians. Pictured: Big Ben, Westminster Bridge and red double decker bus in London, England  Mr Hansford said Victoria's outbreak set back international travel by four or six months, and travel to the UK and Hawaii could have otherwise recommenced between April and June 2021.  While the forecast flight dates appear promising, overseas travel is hinging on the development of a coronavirus vaccine.  Last month, Scott Morrison said globetrotting would not be possible until a jab becomes available to Australians.  'Right now, the opportunity for large scale travel beyond our borders is not foreseeable,' he told A Current Affair."

Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi agreed on the policy with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen during a meeting in Phnom Penh, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.  It is the third such agreement Japan has struck this month as Tokyo looks for ways to gradually relax immigration restrictions imposed on nearly 150 countries to slow the pandemic. The other two deals were reached with Singapore and Malaysia.  Motegi aims to clinch similar travel resumption agreements with Laos and Myanmar, which he will visit on the final two stops of his four-nation tour through Tuesday. Before Cambodia, he was in Papua New Guinea.  He also told the prime minister that Japan is prepared to allow the entry of Cambodian students sponsored by the Japanese government at an early date, according to the ministry.  In addition to bilateral affairs, they discussed the situations in the South China Sea and North Korea, agreeing to maintain close cooperation on those issues, the ministry said.  Motegi also held talks separately with his Cambodian counterpart Prak Sokhonn, who doubles as deputy prime minister. The two agreed to speed up talks toward easing entry restrictions for short-term business travelers, it said.

Photo / Supplied  As the global aviation sector battles to claw back its lost billions amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Australians dreaming of a jaunt abroad could be dusting off their passports within the year.  Qantas CEO Alan Joyce gave his insights into when we will be heading overseas again earlier this week. During a trading post in which the airline announced they'd made a $2 billion loss for FY20, Mr Joyce gave a rather optimistic forecast on overseas travel.  Mr Joyce said he predicts international travel to return by mid-2021, after the Federal Government put a ban on overseas travel in March.  But a small detail in his address points to a sign that longer overseas routes that require larger aircraft – such as A380s and the like – could be a lot further away, shedding some light on where Australians will be able to travel to first.  ""Most airlines will come through this crisis a lot leaner, which means we have to reinvent how we run parts of our business to succeed in a changed market,"" Mr Joyce said on Thursday.  Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said he expects Aussies to be heading overseas at some point next year. Photo / File  ""We have parked the A380 for at least three years … We have put the 787s in long-term storage which fly transcontinental and we believe the earliest we will see the international borders opening up is the middle of next year.  ""The US, with the level of [coronavirus] prevalence there, it is probably going to take some time. There will probably need to be a vaccine before we could see [flights] happening.

So that could mean that the US is seen as a market by the end of 2021, hopefully we could, dependent on a vaccine, start seeing flights again.""  Earlier this month, Prime Minister Scott Morrison dashed the hopes of would-be globe trotters hoping to head overseas by Christmas, announcing that Australia's border would remain closed indefinitely. He made the comments after more than five months of barring citizens and permanent residents from leaving the country.  ""International travel constraints on inbound arrivals to Australia should be continued in their current form,"" he said on August 7.  ""We look forward to at some point that that might be able to be altered but at this point we are not going to put any further strain on the quarantine arrangements around the country and that will remain in place now for some months.""  Australian travellers will be looking closer to home for their first trips abroad. Photo / Greg Bowker  Since border closures came into effect, all eyes have been on Australia's trans-Tasman bubble with New Zealand. But following the recent outbreak of coronavirus cases in Auckland – that prospect of travelling across the ditch has been put on ice.  ""The Australian government has been keen to move on the trans-Tasman bubble, involving New Zealand, and the Bula bubble involving Fiji and several other South West Pacific Islands,"" Dr David Beirman, tourism lecturer at the University of Technology, told news.com.au.  ""Problem is, that unless we have some uniformity on internal Australian travel … it's very difficult to work travel bubbles such as those which already operate in the EU countries.""  But according to aviation expert Neil Hansford, New Zealand still remains at the top of his list of the first country to open to Australians. He predicts the Pacific Islands and even Singapore will closely follow.  ""I think the world understands social distancing of 1.5-2 metres and the opening up won't be universal,"" he said.  ""Africa and South America could be 24-36 months away. Even with a vaccine only wealthy nations populations will be able to afford it and even in Australia to vaccinate all of us within three months would be impossible.  ""Once other countries can demonstrate NSW levels, the world will open up.""  Mr Hansford predicted travel to countries like the UK and even Hawaii would've happened between April and June of 2021, but the setback from Victoria's outbreak ""has put back the [international travel] restart time by four or six months"".  But when our borders do open once again, Mr Hansford predicts 10 countries will be the first on the Australian travel list:  1. New Zealand  2. Pacific Islands  3. Singapore  4. Japan  5. Vietnam  6. Cambodia  7. UK  8. Germany  9. Scandinavia except Sweden  10. Ireland"

First, grainy videos appeared on a fake Facebook page, claiming that he had slept with three sisters and their mother. Then a government-controlled religious council defrocked the monk for having violated Buddhist precepts of celibacy. Fearing imminent arrest, the monk fled Cambodia, destined for a life in exile, like so many people who have stood up to Asia’s longest-governing leader.  The monk, Luon Sovath, was the victim of a smear campaign this summer that relied on fake claims and hastily assembled social media accounts designed to discredit an outspoken critic of the country’s authoritarian policies. A New York Times investigation found evidence that government employees were involved in the creation and posting of the videos on Facebook.  His downfall shows how repressive governments can move with stunning speed to disgrace their opponents, using social media and technology to amplify their divisive campaigns. Under Prime Minister Hun Sen, the Cambodian government has repeatedly used falsified Facebook posts or manipulated audio to defame and imprison politicians, activists and other human rights defenders.  Facebook has come under fire in the United States for disseminating hate speech and disinformation. It has been criticized for failing to detect Russian influence in the 2016 election, providing a platform for conspiracy theories and allowing false claims about the coronavirus to proliferate.  But its influence is even greater in places like Cambodia, where the social media platform is the only digital interface for millions of people. Since civil liberties are often constricted in such countries, Facebook can be a powerful tool for autocrats to bolster their grip on the state, even as it provides a rare space for free expression and activism.  During his nearly 35-year rule, Hun Sen — a onetime soldier for the genocidal Khmer Rouge and now an enthusiastic Facebook user — has decimated Cambodia’s political opposition. He has cozied up to China, eschewing aid from the West that was conditioned on improving human rights. Many high-profile activists and opposition politicians have been assassinated, their cases rarely investigated properly.  As scandals proliferate on its platform, Facebook has been criticized for being too slow in removing problematic accounts and pages, many fake. It took almost a month for Facebook to take down the page on which the videos smearing the monk first aired.  “As a company, you would think they would want to be more vigilant and not allow their platform to be misused,” said Naly Pilorge, director of the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights. “Facebook’s reaction has been like little drops from a sink, so late and so little.”  In a statement to The Times about Luon Sovath’s case, Facebook said that it had built up a team in Cambodia to better monitor the local situation.  “We recognize the important role that Facebook plays in enabling expression in Cambodia,” the company said. “We want people to feel safe when they’re using our platform, which is why we take reports of impersonation and other violations of our community standards seriously.”  Last month, Luon Sovath, who is now in Switzerland after receiving a humanitarian visa, was charged in absentia by prosecutors in Siem Reap province with raping one of the sisters, escalating the accusations in the videos.  The sex charges against Luon Sovath, one of Cambodia’s most celebrated activist monks, went viral. Copies of the videos, which purported to show Facebook Messenger calls between the monk and some of the women, were shared widely on the social media platform.  He has denied the rape charges, along with accusations that he had sexual relations with any of the women.  Clues in the videos, uncovered by The Times, also undercut the claims.  An analysis found split-second footage in which personal information of two government employees briefly flashes on screen. The employees work for the Press and Quick Reaction Unit, a propaganda arm of Cambodia’s Cabinet.  The videos were uploaded on a Facebook page that assumed the identity of one of the sisters, Tim Ratha, who denied both ownership of the page and any sexual relationship with the monk. The page was created the day the videos were posted and lifted photographs from the sister’s real Facebook account.  A fake Facebook account in the monk’s name was also linked to the videos. It, too, stole images from Luon Sovath’s real account and was established one day before the videos came out.  While the Facebook page has been taken down, the videos are still circulating. The two government employees linked to the production of the videos remain on Facebook, posting makeup tips and animal memes on their timelines.  “We know that Facebook will side with repressive regimes if their bottom line is impacted by freedom-of-expression issues,” said Michael Caster, a human rights researcher who has studied technology use in authoritarian countries.  (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)  In some developing countries, the Silicon Valley company’s influence is outsize because smartphone users looking for cheap digital packages rely on its products as their sole source of information online.  The dependence can be deadly. In Myanmar, military-linked Facebook accounts inflamed hatred of the Rohingya amid the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim ethnic group. Hate speech circulating on WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, fueled anti-Muslim mobs in India. Incendiary rumors about minority Muslims in Sri Lanka spread unchecked on Facebook, leading to fatal riots in 2018. Facebook apologized this year for its role in the Sri Lanka violence.  In May, Facebook released the findings of independent human rights assessments conducted in several countries, including Cambodia. Facebook acknowledged that freedom of expression was “severely restricted” in Cambodia and that human rights defenders were jailed for views expressed on social media.  “The information environment was dominated by misinformation and rumor,” Facebook said in a summary of the report. “This was exacerbated by state control of the media and cyberwarfare strategies and compounded by low digital literacy.”  Facebook said it had nearly tripled its human content moderators in Cambodia, although it would not say how many people worked in Khmer, the local language. From January to March, Facebook said, it took down 1.7 billion fake accounts worldwide.  But none of the tripwires appear to have been triggered in the case of the monk, even as his fate was front-page news in the government-controlled media. Over the years, Luon Sovath said, he has been the repeated victim of fake Facebook accounts set up in his name and reported them to the company. “I want to say to Facebook, you should help to restore and defend human rights and democracy in Cambodia,” he said.  Luon Sovath, 42, was ordained as a monk at age 12. As repression proliferated under Hun Sen, the monk began preaching human rights from his pagoda.  While politicians and activists who spoke up against Hun Sen’s government were jailed, exiled or even killed, Luon Sovath appeared to be protected by his saffron-hued robes. But in elections two years ago, the governing Cambodian People’s Party won every seat in Parliament after the main opposition party was disbanded and its leader imprisoned. The independent news media was eviscerated.  Luon Sovath said he knew he was living on borrowed time. “They went after opposition politicians, NGOs, human rights activists, and now it comes to my turn,” he said.  On May 30, four videos appeared on a Facebook page that had been set up earlier in the day. The page masqueraded as that of Tim Ratha, a 30-year-old nurse whose family has a house and grocery store across the street from the monk’s pagoda. “He is a good and respectful monk,” Tim Ratha said in an interview.  Shortly after the videos appeared on Facebook, police in Siem Reap demanded Tim Ratha report to the station at night, she said. Their questions were rapid-fire and intimidating, she said: Why would you have a sexual relationship with a monk — with your sisters and mother no less? What is your Facebook password? That’s your phone, isn’t it?  Tim Ratha denied everything, even as her voice was shaking from fear, she recalled. “We are just victims,” she said. “We didn’t commit anything wrong.”  The four videos consist of nothing more than fuzzy footage of smartphones with the monk’s fake Facebook profile on the screens. Audio seems to emanate from the phones, as if he is chatting with the women on Messenger.  📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

A benefit for one is a benefit for all in this small community surrounded by bamboo forests and rice fields.  “This forest is like our rice pot and kitchen. There is always food to eat, said Songphol Chantarueng, a local village leader.

Women forage for bamboo shoots in the cool undergrowth, where mushrooms clamour out of enriched soil.  A local woman extracts bamboo shoots in the community forest. (Photo: Jack Board)  All of this activity - unfolding just like it has for generations - might have disappeared from this place altogether. A fight has been unfolding in the forests of northern Thailand.  In 2015, the Thai government announced plans to convert this forest and wetland area into a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). The plan would involve land reclamation, laying of concrete and building of factories.  Advertisement  The locals campaigned against the plan, and it appears to have been shelved, at least for now.  Change has been coming fast to Thailand’s border areas, strategic satellites centres for international trade, investment and power development.  The development of SEZs has long been on the agenda of various governments - under the military rule of Prayut Chan-o-cha, the plot arrived in Boon Reuang.    The 483-hectare wetland forest is located downstream from the Ing watershed, flanked by the Doi Yao mountain range and the Mekong river in Chiang Rai province.  The water tributary sustains life here, for the several hundred residents and an abundance of wildlife. Crucially, it holds water during the wet season and is a crucial natural cog in flood management and climate change mitigation.  The notion of their land being irrevocably transformed and their livelihoods coming under threat was a surprising one. It left the community confounded, but they refused to be flat footed.  The watershed is an imporant resource in local climate change mitigation. (Photo: Jack Board)  “Back then, I felt deep down inside that the issue was far from me. They wouldn’t come to our forest because, in my mind, as a villager, the area is low. If they wanted to fill it, where would they find the soil? This was the thought of a clueless villager,” said Songphol.  “I felt dismay. This is why we gathered together as a group, the forest conservation group. We tried to communicate and make them understand.”  With the assistance of various partners and advocacy groups, and the harnessing of social media, the community coordinated and formed the Boon Rueang Wetland Conservation Group.  They enlisted the help of long-time local environmental advocate Niwat Roikaew, the president of Rak Chiang Khong Group, to develop a strategy to save the wetland forest.  “If such an area was destroyed or changed into something else, the Ing river’s ecosystem would be annihilated. Nature would be gone. The way of living and the culture would be destroyed too,” Niwat said.  Songphol Chantarueng is one of the key local figures in protecting Boon Reuang. (Photo: Jack Board)  LOCAL KNOWLEDGE, CONNECTION TO ENVIRONMENT KEY TO CONSERVATION EFFORTS  For the people of Boon Reuang, defending their patch of earth was a natural instinct. But it was not to be defined by violence or fierce protest, rather by knowledge and science and spurred by a deep connection to the environment.  “They have a historical foundation in their village and their community because this village has been here for a long time. Therefore, they have roots,” Niwat said.  “Humans have roots, background and culture that have been changing, but they adhere to something together. It’s a deep power that they have together.  “And they can stop this because they have love in their hearts, and they see that it will be beneficial to their children and grandchildren in the future.”  Being able to understand and explain why the forest was important to the community and the wider environment became a central thrust in their efforts.  The community here has used this land for about 300 years. (Photo: Jack Board)  Conservation and sustainability became more important than ever before. The land was identified as an important carbon sink and utilised as an educational tool.  Locals put banners on their homes and refused to take them down. And they flooded community meeting sessions, armed with information and an attitude of resilience and confidence.  Social inclusion and women voices were promoted. Local knowledge became a force and a bridge to global issues of resonance. Dialogue became a weapon. The protection of culture was regarded as sacrosanct in negotiations.  “They pointed out the forest’s benefits to the world. There’s knowledge here about how much carbon this forest can store. What is its benefit? What is its worth? What is its value? These are important things,” Niwatt recounted.  Rice growing is a common activity in this area, which is frequently flooded. (Photo: Jack Board)  The efforts paid off. In 2018, the community was informed that the SEZ development had been abandoned in their area.  But it has not been a complete victory. They are yet to receive any formal confirmation that the land will be free from future developments.  “We have only heard a verbal promise,” said Songphol, who acts as the chairman of the local conversation group.  “Yes, I am proud, but I don’t remain actionless. I am proud that the forest is still here but there’s nothing guaranteed or to make me feel reassured.”  The community has since received global recognition. It was awarded the prestigious 2020 Equator Prize awarded by the United Nations Development Programme.  It was one of just 10 winners from hundreds of entries across the world and testament to the efforts to reduce poverty through conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, with a ceremony to be held in September.  The Thai government proposed turning this land into an industrial area. (Photo: Jack Board)  This type of success for small agrarian communities is rare in a wider region where land grabbing is rife and local voices are often disempowered.  Southeast Asia is the region most prone to land disputes in the world, according to a 2017 report by the Rights and Resources Initiative, and UK consultancy group TMP Systems. The vast majority of such cases are unresolved.  Despite the apparent backdown in Boon Reuang, other parts of northern Thailand along the border with Laos, as well as other locations bordering Cambodia, remain under consideration for further SEZ development.  While investment and infrastructure promises prosperity and jobs for local populations, resistance remains among those impacted, particularly when it comes to the construction of factories or polluting industry.  With a united voice and armed with knowledge, the Boon Reuang community managed to save their land from development. (Photo: Jack Board)  “It has always been like this, in every generation and every era, that economics are seen as more important than environmental matters, way of living, culture or community,” Niwat said.  POTENTIAL BLUEPRINT FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES  Environment groups like The Center for People and Forests (RECOFTC), one of Boon Reuang’s supporting partners, want to take advantage of this success, and use the experience as a potential blueprint for other communities.  “There are lots of lessons that other communities could learn from Boon Rueang's experience, especially in their efforts to adapt to climate change and more recently, their resiliency to COVID-19 impacts,” said RECOFTC’s executive director, David Ganz.  Climate change, drought and disturbances on their rivers will pose risks in the years to come here. But for now, the most pressing challenge, the very survival of this land in its natural state, has been met.  Fishing occurs in a large swamp, only open for a few weeks a year. (Photo: Jack Board)  As buffaloes graze undisturbed under building monsoon clouds, it is clear why locals hold this place dear. And they plan to keep the forest theirs for good.  “The protection and taking care of the forest is something we carry on from our parents,” said Songphol. “Now it’s the duty of my generation. Next, it will be the duty of the generations of children and grandchildren to come.”    Additional reporting by Ryn Jirenuwat."

I don’t know what to do,” he said.  Mahbubur is the only breadwinner in his family and facing hardship as he could not get any job in Bangladesh.  Dreaming of a better future, Md Kabir Hossain, 32, a worker from Kaliakoir in Manikganj left for Qatar in 2010. He began to work as a cleaner and after working in several roles in different sectors, he has settled as a worker in a gas plant.  Kabir, who came home on a vacation in January, cannot go back to Qatar now. He came prepared to stay home for two months, but more than six months have already passed. “I want to go back to Qatar but don’t know how I can,” he said.  Kabir, once a driver in Bangladesh, has already borrowed a lot of money from his relatives. He is worried over his future.  More than 10 million workers like Mahbubur and Kabir are the driving force of the economy. Among them, more than 100,000 workers are unable to return to their workplaces after they came home amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Almost 80,000 expatriate Bangladeshi nationals returned home from abroad in the last four months amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Ministry of Expatriate Welfare and Overseas Employment.  At least 78,043 workers returned home from 23 countries between Apr 1 and Aug 22: 73,311 men and 4,732 women, according to the Expatriate Welfare Desk in Dhaka.  The highest number of workers -- 25,653 -- returned furloughed from the United Arab Emirates.  At least 15,389 workers, including 1,593 women, came home with outpass after serving jail terms in Saudi Arabia. Oman sent back 3,884 workers, while Bahrain sent 746 workers with outpass after they served jail time.  As the Maldives has a tourism-based economy, the employers sent back 7,909 workers after the tourism industry was upended by the pandemic. After their contracts were over, 1,382 expatriate workers returned from Singapore. At least 7,329 Bangladeshi workers returned home from Kuwait after their visas expired.  A total of 11,133 workers returned from South Africa, Qatar, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Iraq due to scarcity of jobs. Also, 116 workers returned from Sri Lanka and Mauritius, while 100 came from South Korea, 1,026 from Jordan, 122 from Vietnam after their contracts were over. On Jul 6, Italy repatriated 151 Bangladeshi workers suspected to be infected with the coronavirus.  According to the Expatriate Welfare Desk, 3,103 workers returned from Russia, Turkey, Lebanon, Nepal, Hong Kong and Japan.  The pandemic left thousands of migrant workers marooned in Bangladesh, said the officials in different organisations working for the migrants.  The government should continue its diplomatic efforts to ensure those workers can go back to their workplaces, they said adding that the migrant workers should be included in the humanitarian aid programmes the government opened to cushion the effects of the pandemic.  More than 200,000 workers came home for holiday from February to March when the flights were still open, Shariful Hasan, head of the Migrant Programme at BRAC, said citing the home ministry and Expatriate Welfare Desk. They could not return to their workplaces as of now. Another 25,000 workers came back in chartered flights.  “On an average, 50,000 to 60,000 migrant workers go overseas. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, almost 250,000 workers could not go overseas from March to July. At least 100,000 workers failed to go despite having valid visas, passports and other documents,” he said.  The workers’ return to their workplaces depends on two factors -- a green light from their employers and the alleviation of the coronavirus epidemic in Bangladesh, he said. “These two are interrelated.”  “The employers will never ask them to return to work unless the situation in Bangladesh goes back to normal. Some of the countries are gradually opening their doors to migrant workers but Bangladesh could not make it to that, as the coronavirus crisis is yet to be eased,” he said.  The government should, therefore, focus on alleviating the coronavirus crisis at home, Shariful Hasan said.  Bangladeshi workers will not be allowed to enter several countries until October as the authenticity of the coronavirus testing certificate in Bangladesh is questioned, said Tasnim Siddique, president of Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit.  The government should highlight the measures they took against the issue and ensure that the certificates are authentic, she said adding the government must continue its diplomatic efforts to prevent repatriation of workers.  First, the irregularities in the country should be addressed and monitored, said Tasnim adding those involved in the irregularities should be punished. They should pay compensation to the migrant workers who suffered due to the irregularities.  “The overall situation has improved.”  The government has initiated a Tk 5 billion project to provide loans to those expatriate workers who could not go back to their workplaces, while the Ministry of Expatriate Welfare and Overseas Employment provided Tk 2 billion from the wage earner welfare fund, said Tasnim adding the aid should be planned and coordinated to ensure the best results for workers.  The government will try to employ those workers who could not return to their workplaces, said Imran Ahmed, minister of expatriate welfare and overseas employment.  ""The pandemic has upended the global economy. We are preparing to fight it by taking up different programmes.""  The poor and disadvantaged migrant workers already repatriated and also the families of those workers still overseas will be brought under the social safety net and other aid programmes, he said.  Those workers repatriated due to the coronavirus pandemic are receiving Tk 5,000 in aid after completion of the quarantine period, the minister said. Also, the government opened a Tk 7 billion fund for the migrant workers, including a Tk 2 billion loan programme for their rehabilitation. They have taken the initiative to train them and send them for overseas employment again.  Experienced workers coming back from overseas will receive certification of their skills. The government will provide Tk 100 million for emergency food aid and other assistance for expatriate workers abroad.  Each of the families of migrant workers who died from COVID-19 will receive Tk 300,000 in aid as soon as possible."

Right now both domestic and international travel are an absolute headache. If you’re from the United States, it’s just a lot easier to not travel than attempt to navigate all of the different rules and safety measures for the countries that are still accepting American travelers, of which there aren’t too many. In 2019, the U.S. passport granted access to 116 countries without a visa. Today there are only 39. The U.S. State Department is under a global Level 4 Health Advisory — which strongly discourages international travel of any kind. Aside from that, most countries just straight up don’t want us around, considering the U.S. is the current epicenter of the coronavirus worldwide. Sure, lots of countries get significant economic support from our tourist dollars, but they’re not about to put their population’s health at risk in the name of making some money off of Americans. Even the countries that are currently accepting American travelers aren’t doing so blindly. Many of them have very specific rules and precautionary measures that you’ll want to be aware of if you do happen to be traveling, for whatever reason (remember that a panel of epidemiologists we assembled strongly discouraged this). For information, edification, and context, we’ve created a list of all the countries that are still accepting your passport and all the information you’ll need before boarding an international flight (for whatever reason) to visit them.  Albania Albania’s borders are now opened to international travel, including from the United States. U.S citizens returning to the United States are only allowed to transit into a Schengen country on their journey home, and additional health screening procedures are in place at airports and all points of entry for both arriving and departing travelers. You do not need a negative COVID-19 test to enter the country. Antigua and Barbuda Antigua and Barbuda’s border is now open to international travel though all passengers arriving by air must have a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result that has been taken within seven days of their flight. If arriving by sea, all travelers will be subject to quarantine and are subject to assessment by the Port Health Authorities for signs and symptoms. Upon arrival, passengers will have to take a COVID-19 test at the cost of $100.  Armenia Armenia’s borders reopened to American travelers on August 12th. Visitors will be subject to a 14-day quarantine but will be allowed to leave as soon as a negative test result is returned to them. Travelers may request a PCR test at their hotel, where they will self isolate while waiting for the results. Aruba Prospective travelers from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming must first take a PCR Test and upload their results prior to departure. All passengers must be tested 72 hours prior to their departure time and the results must be submitted 12-hours before the departure time for processing. Visitors from other states are encouraged to take the COVID-19 PCR test but must do so at their own expense. All visitors are encouraged to bring masks and must wear them on the flight and while in the Queen Beatrix International Airport.  Bahamas The Bahamas are finally open to American travelers, sort of. All Americans entering the Bahamas must have a negative COVID-19 PCR test result taken no more than ten days prior to the date of travel and will be subject to a 14-day quarantine. Barbados Commercial flights to Barbados from the United States resumed via JetBlue on July 25th, Virgin Atlantic on August 1st, and American Airlines on October 5th. As of July, beaches and parks in the country are no longer under limited hours and social gatherings of up to 500 people are permitted. All travelers will need a negative COVID-19 test result for entry and will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.  Belarus Travelers entering Belarus from the US are no longer required to self-quarantine upon arrival, though temperature screenings will be issued once arriving at the Minsk National Airport. Social distancing measures in the country are on a city-specific basis, with Minsk containing the majority of restrictions. Belize Belize opened to international travel beginning on August 15th but travelers will be subject to additional safety precautions. Travelers must register on the Belize health app, receive a negative COVID-19 PCR test result within 72 hours of travel, maintain social distance in the country, and wear face masks at the airport, where they will encounter additional screening processes. Once in the country, visitors must regularly record their symptoms on the Belize Health app until the day of their departure.  Bermuda All travelers must complete the Bermuda travel authorization process online within 48 hours of their departure. A $75 fee will cover the cost of COVID-19 testing in Bermuda, but travelers are encouraged to take a PCR Covid-19 test up to 72 hours before their departure. Face masks are required in all public spaces on the island, and travelers must report their temperatures twice per day. Brazil Brazil is now open to American travelers with virtually no travel restrictions. The country advises that all travelers have valid insurance that covers COVID-19 treatment, which is kind of a scary way of suggesting that if you travel to Brazil, you’re probably going to get COVID-19.  Cambodia Travelers hoping to fly to Cambodia will have to make a deposit of $3,000 at the Phnom Penh International Airport to cover any virus prevention services. Visitors will also be required to take a COVID-19 test and will have the funds returned to them, minus the $160 it costs to take the test. On the bright side, meals will be provided while you wait for your results. Meals that you pay for. Costa Rica Beginning on September 1st, travelers from New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and Connecticut may enter the country with a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken at least 48 hours before their arrival.  Croatia American tourists who can present a negative COVID-19 PCR test 48 hours before their flight have been permitted to enter Croatia since July 10th. Dominica Dominica opened its borders to American travelers on August 7th. All arriving passengers will need to bring a negative COVID-19 PCR test result taken no later than 72 hours before boarding, fill out an online questionnaire, and will be subjected to additional rapid testing upon arrival.  Dominican Republic All passengers flying into the Dominican Republic will have their temperatures checked as they disembark. Anyone registering a temperature above 100.6 degrees or any symptoms related to COVID-19 will be given a rapid COVID-19 test and necessary protocols for isolation and treatment will be administered. Travelers will also have to fill out and submit a Traveler’s Health Affidavit. Social distancing measures are in place at most hotels, bars, restaurants, and transportation services in the Dominican Republic. Ecuador Travelers arriving in Ecuador must have a negative PCR COVID-19 test result issued within ten days of their arrival. As of August 16th, the country has ended its mandatory quarantine.  Egypt Officially, all travelers landing in Egypt will be subject to a 14-day quarantine in all cases, though Travel Off Path has some anecdotal evidence that this restriction is no longer in place. French Polynesia Travelers must submit proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within three days of their departure date. Arriving passengers must self-test for days after their arrival to Tahiti.  Grenada Grenada is now open to American travelers but requires quite a bit of hoop-jumping if you want to enter. American travelers must have two negative COVID-19 PCR tests, agree to contact tracing, and sign a lengthy health declaration. Honduras Honduras is now opened to American travelers, though all arriving travelers must bring proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken at most 72 hours prior to arrival.  Ireland The Republic of Ireland strongly advises against non-essential travel into Ireland, and all arriving visitors must self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Jamaica Travelers from the United States must obtain a negative COVID-19 PCR test result at least 10 days prior to their departure date for Jamaica. All travelers must also fill out an application to obtain official travel authorization from Jamaica.  Kosovo The Pristina International Airport is open to all travelers, though the U.S. Embassy to Kosovo reports that U.S. citizens continue to be denied boarding if they cannot prove they are a resident or citizen of Kosovo. The embassy suggests you contact your airline before your trip. Lebanon Lebanon’s borders are open to international travel but visitors must show a negative test result for COVID-19 taken within four days of their arrival. Passengers staying for over seven days must submit another test, which will be given at the airport. Passengers must self-quarantine while waiting for results.  Maldives As of July 15th, the Maldives is opened to tourists of all nationalities with no incoming travel restrictions, though some restrictive measures are in place at hotels, resorts, and public spaces. Mexico Mexico’s border with the United States is still closed but travelers may fly into the country with little restrictions. Travelers may be subject to temperature checks, health screenings, and are advised to self-quarantine on a state by state basis.  Montenegro Montenegro’s borders are now open to American tourists but all arriving travelers must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken 72 hours prior to their departure. North Macedonia North Macedonia requires masks in all public spaces but has no other self-isolation or test requirements to enter the country. U.S. citizens are advised to avoid travel to the country.  St. Barts International travel is now open to the island of St. Barts but all visitors must provide a negative COVID-19 test result taken within 72 hours of arrival. Visitors staying in excess of seven days must take an additional test on their eighth day. St. Lucia Saint Lucia is currently in its phase one of reopening, which requires the use of face masks on all island transportation and public areas. All arriving passengers must have a negative COVID-19 PCR test result taken within 7 days of their departure date.  St. Marteen Prior to travel, passengers must receive a negative COVID-19 test 72 hours before their departure and will be subjected to additional health screenings upon arrival. Travelers must also complete a self-health declaration online. St. Vincent and the Grenadines All travelers arriving in St. Vincent and the Grenadines must take a COVID-19 PCR test if they don’t arrive with a negative COVID-19 antigen test or negative PCR test result. Travelers who arrive without the negative test results will be required to quarantine and monitor their temperature for 14 days, reporting any changes to local health authorities. Those who arrive with positive test results will be isolated at a facility at the cost of the traveler.  Serbia Serbia has no COVID-19 related restrictions for travelers, though U.S. travelers are advised to enroll in the country’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive alerts and updates related to COVID-19. Tanzania Tanzania has no additional requirements for international travelers, though travelers may be subjected to additional health screenings once landing in the country.  Turkey Turkey currently has no travel restrictions for international travelers, though passengers will be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival. Travelers who test positive will be referred to a private hospital by the Ministry of Health Border Unit if they aren’t Turkish citizens. Turks and Caicos Passengers must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result within five days of travel. All travelers must have medical/travel insurance that covers medevac, complete a health screening, and agree to a privacy policy prior to arrival."

Foreign M… [+991 chars]","The foreign ministers of Japan and Myanmar agreed Monday to reopen borders for expatriates and other long-term residents as soon as early September, relaxing travel restrictions that were imposed to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic.  Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi also confirmed at their meeting in Naypyidaw that they would speed up talks to facilitate short-term business travel, while taking measures to combat the virus, according to the Foreign Ministry.  Motegi, in his final stop on a four-nation tour since Thursday, told reporters online that his country's pledges of economic and medical support to leaders in the respective countries demonstrated that ""Japan leads international cooperation efforts"" in fighting the pandemic.  The tour also included Papua New Guinea, Laos and Cambodia.  The visits to the countries came as Japan, which currently bans in principle entry by foreign nationals from 146 countries and regions, launched talks with 16 economies, including Myanmar, to resume travel in tandem with the restart of domestic socioeconomic activities.  Besides Myanmar, Japan agreed with Cambodia and Laos over the weekend and with Singapore and Malaysia earlier this month to allow reciprocal travel of long-term residents as early as September.  Under the arrangements, long-term residents are allowed to travel on condition they stay at home or at a designated place for 14 days after arrival and take steps to reduce the risk of infection.  At the talks with Suu Kyi, Motegi also pledged loans of ¥30 billion ($283 million) to the Myanmar government as emergency budget support and ¥15 billion to support small and medium-sized firms amid the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, the ministry said.  The fresh provisions came on top of virus-related aid worth over $30 million that Japan has administered to Myanmar, including the provision of medical supplies such as the antiviral drug Avigan, a potential coronavirus treatment drug manufactured by a unit of Fujifilm Holdings Corp., it said.  Motegi also said to reporters, ""The leaders and I shared an understanding over the South China Sea issue,"" referring to the maritime areas where tensions are high amid China's rising military assertiveness. He did not elaborate further.  The foreign minister added that he had ""gained their understanding and support for a free and open Indo-Pacific (region) that Japan is actively promoting.""  In the meeting, Motegi also noted the importance of Myanmar ""steadily implementing"" the provisional order issued by the International Court of Justice in January requiring it to take ""all measures"" to end the persecution of the country's Rohingya ethnic minority by the Myanmar military, the ministry said.  Regarding that issue, Motegi told reporters he had spoken to Suu Kyi about Japan's continuing support for Myanmar's efforts to improve the situation in Rakhine state, from which Rohingya Muslims have fled to take refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. He said Suu Kyi responded by saying she would make efforts to do so as much as possible.  More than 740,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from the western Myanmar state to Bangladesh since 2017 in the wake of a brutal crackdown against insurgents by Myanmar's armed forces. Their return to their native state remains slow amid concern of violence.  Motegi also stated Japan's ""full-fledged support"" for Myanmar's democratic nation building, and an election observer mission is set to be dispatched to the Nov. 8 general election in Myanmar, the ministry said.  Motegi also met with Min Aung Hlaing, commander-in-chief of the Myanmar military.

This story also ran on Wired  As the coronavirus crisis lit up this spring, headlines about how the U.S. could innovate its way out of a pending ventilator shortage landed almost as hard and fast as the pandemic itself.  The New Yorker featured “The MacGyvers Taking on the Ventilator Shortage,” an effort initiated not by a doctor or engineer but a blockchain activist. The University of Minnesota created a cheap ventilator called the Coventor; MIT had the MIT Emergency Ventilator; Rice University, the ApolloBVM. NASA created the VITAL, and a fitness monitor company got in the game with Fitbit Flow. The price tags varied from $150 for the Coventor to $10,000 for the Fitbit Flow — all significantly less than premium commercially available hospital ventilators, which can run $50,000 apiece.  Around the same time, C. Nataraj, a Villanova College of Engineering professor, was hearing from front-line doctors at Philadelphia hospitals fearful of running out of ventilators for COVID-19 patients. Compelled to help, Nataraj put together a volunteer SWAT team of engineering and medical talent to invent the ideal emergency ventilator. The goal: build something that could operate with at least 80% of the function of a typical hospital ventilator, but at 20% or less of the cost.  For decades, Nataraj has worked on medical projects — like finding a better way to diagnose a potentially deadly brain injury in premature infants — primarily with doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Geisinger Health system in rural Pennsylvania, so key clinical players came together swiftly. By March 23, he had approached engineering faculty about collaborating on a monthslong effort to build the NovaVent, a basic, low-cost ventilator with parts that cost about $500. The schematics would be open-sourced, so others could use them free of charge to mass-manufacture the device.  Email Sign-Up Subscribe to KHN’s free Morning Briefing.  The New Yorker wasn’t alone in referencing the ’80s TV series “MacGyver,” whose protagonist was a Swiss Army knife-carrying secret agent who got the job done with wits and whatever was at hand. The suggestion was that these ventilators were simple enough to throw together with parts from a medical supply closet or your neighborhood hardware store. “Everybody can make it,” one headline read, enticingly. These miracle machines, the thinking went, could be helpful in U.S. hospitals facing critical shortages, perhaps in cities surging with sick patients.  To understand the potential utility and true costs of these emergency ventilators, KHN followed Villanova’s team for three months as it developed, tested and prepared to submit the NovaVent for Food and Drug Administration approval.  The team tapped a maker of car parts, along with roboticists. It gathered input from anesthesiologists as well as electrical, mechanical, fluid systems and computer engineers. It tapped nurses to help ensure that users would immediately know how to operate the ventilator. Local manufacturers 3D-printed pieces of the machine.  Nataraj and his team realized that some of the other ultra-bare-bones machines wouldn’t meet the standards of the modern U.S. health care system. But they also believed there was a lot of room for Villanova’s team to innovate between those and the high-end, expensive devices from corporations like Philips or Medtronic.  One thing is clear: The $500 ventilator is something of a unicorn.  While the parts for the NovaVent cost about that much, the brainpower and people hours added uncounted value. In the early phases, the core group — all volunteers — worked 20 to 25 hours a week, Nataraj said, mainly via Zoom calls from home on top of their day jobs.  Teams of two or three were allowed into the lab to work — virtually the only people on campus. The effort, after all, was in line with the university’s Augustinian mission, which values the pursuit of knowledge, stewardship and community over the individual.  By the time they realized what they could achieve with the $500 model, the first wave of crisis had passed. Yet in those weeks, an alarm resounded across the land about the dismal state of America’s public health system.  So the NovaVent mission pivoted: build better low-cost vents for hospitals in poor and rural U.S. communities that have few, if any, ventilators.  One immediate legacy of the innovation happening at Villanova and elsewhere is the public-spirited nature of the effort, said Dr. Julian Goldman, an anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who helps set standards for medical devices: “People from different walks of life in terms of their skills — engineers, clinicians, pure scientists — all thinking and working to try to figure out how to move very quickly to solve a national emergency with many dimensions: How do we make the patient safer? How do we make the caregiver safer? How do we deal with supply chain limitations?”  From other ventures, new designs have already been used as a jumping-off point to build emergency ventilators overseas. They’ve also bolstered New York City’s stockpile and could add to state and national reserves as well.  The early, urgent concerns about a looming ventilator shortage were well founded: On March 13, the U.S. had about 200,000 ventilators, according to the Society of Critical Care Medicine. But because of the surge of COVID patients, it was predicted the country could soon need as many as 960,000.  We said, ‘Well, GM is making it. Why are we making it?’ But there was a lot of uncertainty with the epidemiological models. We didn’t know how bad it was going to get. Or [the curve] could completely collapse and there’d be no need at all. C. Nataraj, Villanova College of Engineering professor  In early April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state would run out of ventilators in six days, leaving doctors with the sort of grim calculation they’d heard about from hard-hit northern Italy: “If a person comes in and needs a ventilator and you don’t have a ventilator, the person dies.”  In Philadelphia, 12 miles east of Villanova, hospital administrators braced for shortages and reported short supplies of the drugs required to sedate patients on ventilators.  President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to get major manufacturers to make ventilators, though GM was already working on it. When GM signed a $500 million contract to deliver 30,000 ventilators to the U.S. government by August, the NovaVent team wondered whether its own efforts would be futile.  “We said, ‘Well, GM is making it. Why are we making it?’” Nataraj said. “But there was a lot of uncertainty with the epidemiological models. We didn’t know how bad it was going to get. Or [the curve] could completely collapse and there’d be no need at all.”  And for a few weeks, it did seem the worst was over. The rate of new cases began to slow in the nation’s early epicenters. Hot spots flared in nearly every pocket of the country, but those too were mostly contained.  People spilled back into normal life, gathering in backyards, beaches and bars. In June, news coverage moved on to the calls for racial justice and mass protests after the videotaped killing of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police.  In the background, the highly contagious coronavirus tore across the South, through Florida, Georgia, Texas and Arizona, and surged in California. Some states reported ICU beds were quickly at or above capacity. This mercurial virus had proved uncontrollable, and the prospect of ventilator shortages had bubbled up once again.  ***  Past pandemics have been mothers of innovation. Progress in mechanical ventilation began in earnest after a 1952 polio outbreak in Copenhagen, Denmark. According to the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 50 patients a day arrived at the Blegdams Infectious Disease Hospital. Many had paralyzed respiratory muscles; nearly 90% died.  An anesthesiologist at the hospital realized patients were dying from respiratory failure rather than renal failure, as was previously believed, and recommended forcing oxygen into the lungs of patients. This worked — mortality dropped to 40%. But one big problem remained: Patients had to be “hand-bagged,” with more than 1,500 medical students squeezing resuscitator bags for 165,000 total hours.  “They’d recruit nurses and medical students to stand there and squeeze a bag,” says Dr. S. Mark Poler, a Geisinger Health system anesthesiologist on the NovaVent team. “Sometimes they were just so exhausted that they would fall asleep and stop ventilating. It was obviously a catastrophe, so that was the motivation for creating mechanical ventilators.”  The first ones were simple machines, much like the basic emergency-use ventilators created during the COVID crisis. But those came with hazards such as damaging the lungs by forcing in too much air. More sophisticated machines would deliver better control. These engineering marvels — the monitors, the different modes of ventilation, the slick touch-screen controls designed to minimize the risk of injury or error — improved patient treatment but also drove costs sky-high.  The emergency ventilators of 2020 focused on models that, typically, used an Ambu bag and some sort of mechanical “arm” to squeeze it. Most people are familiar with Ambu bags from scenes in TV programs like “ER” where paramedics compress the manual resuscitator bags to help patients breathe as they’re rushed inside from an ambulance. The bags are already widely available in hospitals, cost $30 to $40 and are FDA-approved.  But making machines that are that simple could render them effectively useless (or, worse, dangerous). Medical experts watching university and hospital teams coalesce across the country this spring to develop low-cost emergency ventilators took notice — and worried.  They look at something and think, well, this can’t be that hard to build. It just blows air. ‘I’ll take a vacuum cleaner and turn it on reverse. … It’s a ventilator!’ Dr. Julian Goldman, an anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who helps set standards for medical devices  ***  Goldman, the Massachusetts General anesthesiologist, was among the medical experts nervous about all the slapped-together ventilators.  “We had the maker community being stood up very quickly, but they don’t know what they don’t know,” said Goldman, chair of the COVID-19 working group for the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, the primary source of standards for the medical device industry. “There were videos of harebrained ideas for building ventilators online by people who don’t know any better, and we were very concerned about that.”  The general public doesn’t really understand the nuances required to build a safe medical device, Goldman said.  “They look at something and think, well, this can’t be that hard to build. It just blows air,” he said. “‘I’ll take a vacuum cleaner and turn it on reverse. … It’s a ventilator!’”  AAMI wanted to encourage innovation, but also safety. So Goldman assembled a meeting of 38 engineers, regulators and clinicians to quickly write boiled-down guidelines for emergency-use ventilators.  The simplest ventilators were based on the idea of a piston in a car engine, Poler said: Put a piston on a crankshaft, hook it up to a motor and use a paddle or “arm” to compress the Ambu bag.  “It’s better than no ventilator at all, but it goes at one speed. It doesn’t really have any controls,” Poler said — not ideal when patients need to be monitored for changes in how their lungs are responding, or not, to treatment.  Villanova’s team of engineers, doctors and nurses realized that the simplest ventilators, the ones that AAMI was concerned about, seemed to ignore some basic, practical considerations: What sort of hospitals would these be used in, and under what conditions? What sorts of patients would be put on these ventilators? For how long? Would they be used as backups for higher-end ventilators? What about error alarms?  All good questions, Poler said, but the answer to all of them essentially is “we hope to never use these.”  Their best use? “A surge situation where you simply don’t have enough of the sophisticated ventilators.”  ***  Rather than go totally bare-bones, the Villanova team designed the devices as though they would one day be deployed in modern health care.  Flow sensors, which monitor patient ventilation, cost several hundred dollars, so the team designed its own in the lab and 3D-printed it at a cost of 50 cents, Nataraj said, enabled by strides in 3D-printing technology that have vastly cut the price of so many devices. Southco, a Pennsylvania-based global manufacturer that makes parts like the latch on your car’s glove box, was tapped to use its 3D printers to make airflow tubes and couplings for the ventilator.  Garrett Clayton, director of Villanova’s Center for Nonlinear Dynamics and Control, was the day-to-day keeper of the prototype. He was particularly excited about the addition of a handle, which made it easier for him, and eventually others, to lug the 20-pound device from the lab to home and back.  Clayton’s computerized control system measures the flow rate of air going into the patient and converts it into volume, much as commercial ventilators do. That controls how hard and fast the Ambu bag is squeezed; it’s made of a hobby-grade Arduino microcontroller board. A direct-current motor attached to a linear actuator with a fist-shaped piece of PVC on the end pushes the bag in and out. The operator of the ventilator can control the respiratory rate (the number of breaths per minute), as well as the ratio between inspiration and expiration and the volume of air going in.  While traditional ventilators have many control methods, Clayton’s team focused on just one: how much volume is forced into the airway. “We have a set point so we don’t damage the lung,” he said.  Polly Tremoulet, a research psychologist at Rowan University and a human factors consultant, was pulled in to focus on error messages and make sure the ventilators’ buttons and displays “spoke the user’s language,” whether that user was an anesthesiologist in New Jersey or a nurse in India pulled into an ICU COVID ward.  Graduate student Emily Hylton and other nursing students were brought in to provide feedback about using the NovaVent and ask questions such as: Would all the controls and monitors look familiar to nurses at the bedside?  The very prospect of these low-cost devices is relatively new, Nataraj said, because of the price of microcontrollers with any real capacity: “Twenty years ago, they cost, oh gosh, $20,000 — and now they’re $20.”  By May 30, the first NovaVent prototype was complete. It was successfully tested on an artificial lung at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on June 12. Villanova has applied for a patent for the NovaVent, to help ensure it won’t be commercialized by others.  “If you make it free without having a patent, other people can take it and charge for it,” Clayton said. “A patent protects the open-source nature of it.”  Once a provisional patent is received, the team will submit the ventilator for Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA — hewing to the guidelines set up by AAMI.  ***  Within weeks of kicking off the NovaVent project, the curve in the East Coast had indeed flattened, and states had enough standard ventilators to treat every patient. The life-threatening ventilator shortage had not materialized. Some of the emergency-use ventilators based on designs by other teams, like the one at MIT, did go into production — but even those didn’t end up in hospitals, and instead went into city stockpiles meant to reduce potential future reliance on the federal government. So the Villanova team seized on a new, global mission.  “We thought if it wasn’t useful in the U.S. market,” Nataraj said, “we know the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Central America, they don’t have the same kind of facilities that we do here.”  Right now, in Pakistan or in any low-resource country, a family member is hand-ventilating a toddler. Before COVID and after COVID, this is a problem. Dr. Stephen Richardson, a cardiac anesthesiologist  Where the ventilators might end up remains to be seen. Early on, Pennsylvania showed interest in helping Villanova find manufacturing partners. The team has spoken with engineers in India, Cambodia and Sudan (which reportedly has only 80 ventilators in the entire country) who are interested in possibly finding a way to manufacture the NovaVent.  Six thousand emergency ventilators based on the design by the University of Minnesota have been manufactured in the U.S., according to Dr. Stephen Richardson, a cardiac anesthesiologist who worked on that project. Three thousand were made by North Dakota aviation and agricultural manufacturer Appareo for state emergency stockpiles in North Dakota and South Dakota. UnitedHealth Group provided $3 million in funding to manufacture another 3,000 units made by Boston Scientific, which were donated to countries like Peru and Honduras through U.S. organizations; others were sent to the U.S. government.  Like the Villanova team, Richardson said he thinks the most promising potential for these ventilators is in developing countries.  “When we were arranging to get these donated to Honduras, we were speaking with a physician who was telling me that [at] his hospital right now, the med students are just hand-ventilating patients. For everything, and for COVID specifically,” Richardson said. “Right now, in Pakistan or in any low-resource country, a family member is hand-ventilating a toddler. Before COVID and after COVID, this is a problem.”  For Poler, the project was a reminder that the country needs to tend to its stockpiles. “People were thinking about [ventilator reserves] in the ’90s, and then they basically quit thinking about it,” he said. “COVID is a shocking reminder that we shouldn’t have stopped thinking about it.”  Goldman said the national efforts may not result in a flood of cheap ventilators in U.S. hospitals. International use could also be tricky. In countries with few resources, even very low-cost ventilators may not be feasible because of lack of electricity or compressed oxygen, though there is “potentially a sweet spot of need and capability where these things could be deployed.”  On the upside, he said, the pandemic kicked off a nearly unprecedented global engineering effort to share information and solve the problem.  “If there’s going to be a magic bullet to come out of this, it’s going to be the capability of our communities and our infrastructure,” he said. “People stood up, put in the appropriate processes and spirit, worked hard, made it happen. We’ve added resilience to the health care sector. That’s the outcome here.”  As for the NovaVent, team members were relieved they didn’t have to rush it into manufacturing as COVID-19 was ripping through the Northeast this spring, thanks to aggressive efforts to flatten the curve. “We ended up without a ventilator shortage, which is excellent,” Clayton said. “But with the increase in cases now, it’s very possible some of them may get used.”  To build on the project, Villanova is raising money for a laboratory for affordable medical technologies called NovaMed. The lab formalizes the process of making inexpensive medical equipment that follows the 80-20 function-to-cost rule. The university says the lab is “motivated by the belief that income should not determine who has access to lifesaving care.”  The effort to prevent a ventilator shortage, Nataraj said, made him think more critically about the American health care system overall.  “How come we haven’t built the technology, the economic and social systems that are able to handle a situation like this — especially when something like this was predicted?” he said. “It’s absolute nonsense. Why should a single person die because we weren’t prepared?”"

First, grainy videos appeared on a fake Facebook page, claiming that he had slept with three sisters and their mother. Then a government-controlled religious council defrocked the monk for having violated Buddhist precepts of celibacy.  Fearing imminent arrest, the monk fled Cambodia, destined for a life in exile, like so many people who have stood up to Asia’s longest-governing leader.  The monk, Luon Sovath, was the victim of a smear campaign this summer that relied on fake claims and hastily assembled social media accounts designed to discredit an outspoken critic of the country’s authoritarian policies. A New York Times investigation found evidence that government employees were involved in the creation and posting of the videos on Facebook.  His downfall shows how repressive governments can move with stunning speed to disgrace their opponents, using social media and technology to amplify their divisive campaigns.  Under prime minister Hun Sen, the Cambodian government has repeatedly used falsified Facebook posts or manipulated audio to defame and imprison politicians, activists and other human rights defenders.  Facebook has come under fire in the United States for disseminating hate speech and disinformation. It has been criticised for failing to detect Russian influence in the 2016 election, providing a platform for conspiracy theories and allowing false claims about the coronavirus to proliferate.  But its influence is even greater in places like Cambodia, where the social media platform is the only digital interface for millions of people. Since civil liberties are often constricted in such countries, Facebook can be a powerful tool for autocrats to bolster their grip on the state, even as it provides a rare space for free expression and activism.  During his nearly 35-year rule, Hun Sen – a one-time soldier for the genocidal Khmer Rouge and now an enthusiastic Facebook user – has decimated Cambodia’s political opposition. He has cosied up to China, eschewing aid from the West that was conditioned on improving human rights. Many high-profile activists and opposition politicians have been assassinated, their cases rarely investigated properly.  As scandals proliferate on its platform, Facebook has been criticised for being too slow in removing problematic accounts and pages, many fake. It took almost a month for Facebook to take down the page on which the videos smearing the monk first aired.  “As a company, you would think they would want to be more vigilant and not allow their platform to be misused,” said Naly Pilorge, director of the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights. “Facebook’s reaction has been like little drops from a sink, so late and so little.”  In a statement about Luon Sovath’s case, Facebook said that it had built up a team in Cambodia to better monitor the local situation. “We recognise the important role that Facebook plays in enabling expression in Cambodia,” the company said. “We want people to feel safe when they’re using our platform, which is why we take reports of impersonation and other violations of our community standards seriously.”  Government employees  Last month, Luon Sovath, who is now in Switzerland after receiving a humanitarian visa, was charged in absentia by prosecutors in Siem Reap province with raping one of the sisters, escalating the accusations in the videos. The sex charges against Luon Sovath, one of Cambodia’s most celebrated activist monks, went viral. Copies of the videos, which purported to show Facebook Messenger calls between the monk and some of the women, were shared widely on the social media platform.  He has denied the rape charges, along with accusations that he had sexual relations with any of the women. Clues in the videos, uncovered by the New York Times, also undercut the claims. An analysis found split-second footage in which personal information of two government employees briefly flashes on screen. The employees work for the Press and Quick Reaction Unit, a propaganda arm of Cambodia’s cabinet.  The videos were uploaded on a Facebook page that assumed the identity of one of the sisters, Tim Ratha, who denied both ownership of the page and any sexual relationship with the monk. The page was created the day the videos were posted and lifted photographs from the sister’s real Facebook account.  A fake Facebook account in the monk’s name was also linked to the videos. It, too, stole images from Luon Sovath’s real account and was established one day before the videos came out. While the Facebook page has been taken down, the videos are still circulating.  The two government employees linked to the production of the videos remain on Facebook, posting make-up tips and animal memes on their timelines. “We know that Facebook will side with repressive regimes if their bottom line is impacted by freedom-of-expression issues,” said Michael Caster, a human rights researcher who has studied technology use in authoritarian countries.  In some developing countries, the Silicon Valley company’s influence is outsize because smartphone users looking for cheap digital packages rely on its products as their sole source of information online. The dependence can be deadly.  In Myanmar, military-linked Facebook accounts inflamed hatred of the Rohingya amid the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim ethnic group. Hate speech circulating on WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, fuelled anti-Muslim mobs in India. Incendiary rumours about minority Muslims in Sri Lanka spread unchecked on Facebook, leading to fatal riots in 2018. Facebook apologised this year for its role in the Sri Lanka violence.  Luon Sovath has been the repeated victim of fake Facebook accounts set up in his name and he has reported them to the company. Photograph: Adam Dean/The New York Times  In May, Facebook released the findings of independent human rights assessments conducted in several countries, including Cambodia. Facebook acknowledged that freedom of expression was “severely restricted” in Cambodia and that human rights defenders were jailed for views expressed on social media.  “The information environment was dominated by misinformation and rumour,” Facebook said in a summary of the report. “This was exacerbated by state control of the media and cyberwarfare strategies and compounded by low digital literacy.”  Facebook said it had nearly tripled its human content moderators in Cambodia, although it would not say how many people worked in Khmer, the local language. From January to March, Facebook said, it took down 1.7 billion fake accounts worldwide.  But none of the tripwires appear to have been triggered in the case of the monk, even as his fate was front-page news in the government-controlled media. Over the years, Luon Sovath said, he has been the repeated victim of fake Facebook accounts set up in his name and reported them to the company. “I want to say to Facebook, you should help to restore and defend human rights and democracy in Cambodia,” he said.  ‘My turn’  Luon Sovath (42) was ordained as a monk at age 12. As repression proliferated under Hun Sen, the monk began preaching human rights from his pagoda. While politicians and activists who spoke up against Hun Sen’s government were jailed, exiled or even killed, Luon Sovath appeared to be protected by his saffron-hued robes.  But in elections two years ago, the governing Cambodian People’s Party won every seat in parliament after the main opposition party was disbanded and its leader imprisoned. The independent news media was eviscerated.  Luon Sovath said he knew he was living on borrowed time. “They went after opposition politicians, NGOs, human rights activists, and now it comes to my turn,” he said.  On May 30th, four videos appeared on a Facebook page that had been set up earlier in the day. The page masqueraded as that of Tim Ratha, a 30-year-old nurse whose family has a house and grocery store across the street from the monk’s pagoda. “He is a good and respectful monk,” Tim Ratha said in an interview.  Shortly after the videos appeared on Facebook, police in Siem Reap demanded Tim Ratha report to the station at night, she said. Their questions were rapid-fire and intimidating, she said: “Why would you have a sexual relationship with a monk, with your sisters and mother no less? What is your Facebook password? That’s your phone, isn’t it?”  Tim Ratha denied everything, even as her voice was shaking from fear, she recalled. “We are just victims,” she said. “We didn’t commit anything wrong.”  The four videos consist of nothing more than fuzzy footage of smartphones with the monk’s fake Facebook profile on the screens. Audio seems to emanate from the phones, as if he is chatting with the women on Messenger.  The conversations in the videos are purportedly between Luon Sovath and Tim Ratha or Som Bopha, her mother. There are a few sexually suggestive references, including an aside about licking. The monk and the two women said some of the audio is from phone conversations they had. But they say that these chats were edited in a misleading way.  The passage about licking, Tim Ratha said, referred to an expression of affection from her dog. And other parts of the audio, all three said, are not them at all, such as references to specific sexual encounters.  “How can a mother and her daughters do such a thing with the same monk?” said Som Bopha. “It is impossible.”  The three people say they do not know how their private phone conversations went public. Human rights groups say Cambodian authorities regularly harvest phone conversations without people’s knowledge. Tapped or manipulated audio has been used in Cambodian courts to convict the government’s critics.  Tim Ratha said a friend of hers reported the fake page to Facebook multiple times over several days. Pilorge, of the human rights group, said her colleagues filed similar complaints. Facebook said it had not received a single user report questioning the veracity of the page.  In Switzerland, Luon Sovath said he was adjusting to life in exile. His thin monastic robes are sufficient for summer, but when the snows come his tropical inner thermostat will have to adjust, he said. He keeps to a Buddhist monk’s schedule, fasting after noon and meditating.  “I want to go home,” he said. “But I had no choice to run away from my country and become a refugee.” – New York Times"

COVAX currently has the world’s largest and most diverse COVID-19 vaccine portfolio - including nine candidate vaccines, with a further nine under evaluation and conversations underway with other mayor producers.  COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.  In order to be able to secure enough doses of vaccines to protect the most vulnerable populations, such as health workers and the elderly, the next step for the partnership is to confirm potential self-financing participants’ intent to participate by 31 August and to turn these into binding commitments to join the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX Facility) by 18 September, with first upfront payments to follow thereafter, and no later than 9 October 2020.  “Equal access to a COVID-19 vaccine is the key to beating the virus and paving the way for recovery from the pandemic,” said Stefan Löfven, Prime Minister of Sweden. “This cannot be a race with a few winners, and the COVAX Facility is an important part of the solution – making sure all countries can benefit from access to the world’s largest portfolio of candidates and fair and equitable distribution of vaccine doses.”  The COVAX Facility is a Gavi-coordinated pooled procurement mechanism for new COVID-19 vaccines, through which COVAX will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for each participating economy, using an allocation framework currently being formulated by WHO. The COVAX Facility will do this by pooling buying power from participating economies and providing volume guarantees across a range of promising vaccine candidates, allowing those vaccine manufacturers whose expertise is essential to large scale production of the new vaccines, to make early, at-risk investments in manufacturing capacity – providing participating countries and economies with the best chance at rapid access to doses of a successful COVID-19 vaccine.  The success of COVAX hinges not only on countries signing up to the COVAX Facility, but also filling key funding gaps for both COVAX R&D work and a mechanism to support participation of lower-income economies in the COVAX Facility.  “COVID-19 is an unprecedented global health challenge that can only be met with unprecedented cooperation between governments, researchers, manufacturers and multilateral partners,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. “By pooling resources and acting in solidarity through the ACT Accelerator and the COVAX Facility, we can ensure that once a vaccine is available for COVID-19, it’s available equitably to all countries.”  CEPI is leading COVAX vaccine research and development work, which aims to develop three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. Nine candidate vaccines are currently being supported by CEPI; seven of which are currently in clinical trials. Governments, vaccine manufacturers (in addition to their own R&D), organizations and individuals have committed US$ 1.4 billion towards vaccine R&D so far, but an additional US$1 billion is urgently needed to continue to move the portfolio forward.  A further nine candidates vaccines which complement the current CEPI portfolio are currently being evaluated for inclusion in COVAX. Furthermore, COVAX will consider procuring vaccines that complement the portfolio from any producer in the world; conversations are already underway with a number of additional manufacturers not receiving R&D support from CEPI to procure their vaccines if they are successful. Maximizing the portfolio of vaccines increases the probability of success as individual vaccines historically have a high failure rate.  “In the scramble for a vaccine, countries can act alone – creating a few winners, and many losers - or they can come together to participate in COVAX, an initiative which is built on enlightened self-interest but also equity, leaving no country behind,” said Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI. “Only by taking a global view can we protect those most at risk around the world from the terrible effects of this disease. COVAX can deliver the vaccines that could end the pandemic, but it needs countries to step forward both to join the COVAX Facility, and also to address the serious funding shortfalls, including for R&D. The decisions that are taken now about COVID-19 vaccines have the power to change our future. We must be courageous and ambitious in striving for a multilateral solution.”  A collaboration between Serum Institute of India (SII), Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced earlier this month will ensure up to 100 million doses of AstraZeneca or Novavax’s candidate vaccines, if successful, will be available to low- and middle-income economies through the COVAX Facility at just US$ 3 per dose. The arrangement also provides an option to secure additional doses if COVAX sees a need for it. Separate agreements between Gavi, CEPI and AstraZeneca, announced in June, guarantee a further 300 million doses of their candidate vaccine, if successful, for the COVAX Facility.  In addition, in June Gavi launched the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC), a financing instrument aimed at supporting the participation of 92 lower and middle income economies in the COVAX Facility. The COVAX AMC has raised more than US$ 600 million against an initial target of securing US$ 2 billion seed funding from sovereign donors as well as philanthropy and the private sector, needed by the end of 2020. Funding the COVAX AMC will be critical to ensuring ability to pay is not a barrier to accessing COVID-19 vaccines, a situation which would leave the majority of the world unprotected, with the pandemic and its impact continuing unabated.  Eighty higher-income economies, which would finance the vaccines from their own public finance budgets, have so far submitted Expressions of Interest ahead of the deadline of 31 August for confirmation of intent to participate. They will partner with 92 low- and middle-income countries that will be supported by the AMC if it meets its funding targets. Together, this group of 172 countries represents more than 70% of the world’s population. Among the group are representatives from every continent and more than half of the world’s G20 economies.  “The momentum we are witnessing behind this unprecedented global effort means there could be light at the end of the tunnel: A vaccine is our best route to ending the acute phase of the pandemic and the COVAX effort is the best way to get there,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “For higher-income countries it represents a win-win: not only will you be guaranteed access to the world’s largest portfolio of vaccines, you will also be negotiating as part of a global consortium, bringing down prices and ensuring truly global access. Signing up to the COVAX Facility gives each country its best chance at protecting the most vulnerable members of their populations – which in turn gives the world its best chance at mitigating the toll this pandemic has taken on individuals, communities and the global economy. To make this end-to-end vision a reality, we need countries to make end-to-end commitments: funding R&D, signing up to the Facility, and supporting the COVAX AMC.”  The COVAX Facility is coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and forms a key part of COVAX – the vaccines pillar of the ACT Accelerator, a ground-breaking global collaboration involving vaccine manufacturers to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. The overall aim of COVAX is to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world. It will achieve this by sharing the risks associated with vaccine development, and where necessary investing in manufacturing upfront so vaccines can be deployed at scale as soon as they are proven to be safe and effective, and pooling procurement and purchasing power to achieve sufficient volumes to end the acute phase of the pandemic by 2021.  The goal of COVAX is by the end of 2021 to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification. These vaccines will be offered equally to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, initially prioritising healthcare workers then expanding to cover vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. Further doses will then be made available based on country need, vulnerability and COVID-19 threat. The COVAX Facility will also maintain a buffer of doses for emergency and humanitarian use, including dealing with severe outbreaks before they spiral out of control.  ---------------------------------------------  Notes to editors  The full list of CEPI-supported candidate vaccines is as follows:  Inovio, United States of America (Phase I/II)  Moderna, United States of America (Phase III)  CureVac, Germany (Phase I)  Institut Pasteur/Merck/Themis, France/ United States of America /Austria (Preclinical)  AstraZeneca/University of Oxford, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Phase III)  University of Hong Kong, China (Preclinical)  Novavax, United States of America (Phase I/II)  Clover Biopharmaceuticals, China (Phase I)  University of Queensland/CSL, Australia (Phase I)  The nine candidate vaccines that are currently being evaluated for inclusion in the COVAX Facility include two from China, two from the United States of America, one from Republic of Korea, one from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and one global, multi-manufacture partnership.

Harare officially dollarized on the 9th of April in 2009 and adopted a basket of multiple currencies led by the United States Dollar and South African Rand. The local market rejected the Zimbabwean Dollar and started using foreign currencies after record hyperinflation figures eclipsed 250 million (Officially) in July 2008.  However, the local currency was re-introduced in February 2019 under the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) banner with the exchange rate pegged at 1USD to 2.5ZWD. Statutory Instrument 142 of 2019 soon followed in June to ban the use of multiple currencies and enforce the use of a monocurrency in the economy.  What followed afterwards was a rapid decline of the production as a result of a combination of factors coalesced around high inflation, exchange rate volatility and foreign currency shortages. Economic output declined from 4% realized in 2018 to -6.5% recorded in 2019 according to official figures from treasury. Annual inflation raced from 57% in January to 521% recorded in December 2019.  Real tax revenues plummeted from US$5,237 billion collected in 2018 to US$2,691 billion collected in 2019. Inflation consumed household incomes, pension funds and corporate incomes with the latter partially resorting to retrenchments to stay afloat. The World Bank estimates that extreme poverty cases in Zimbabwe increased from 4.7 million in 2018 to 6.6 million people in 2019. The bank projects that the number of those in extreme poverty will increase to 7.6 million in 2020 as household incomes continue to decline and economic hardships persist in view of COVID-19 risks.  Dollarization rush  Zimbabwe's dollarization path follows a host of other case studies in the world. Over the last 40 years, particularly between 1980 and 1998, there was a surge in dollarization that swept many developing economies in South America, Asia and Europe.  Many countries resorted to using the US dollar to either revive or stabilize their economies. The significant inflow of dollars from exports, international remittances and growth in tourism made it easy for countries in South America to dollarize their economies between the 1980s and 1990s. These included Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Bolivia.  There were also many European and Asian countries that went down the same route of dollarizing as a vehicle to stabilize their economies after macroeconomic shocks and political instability. Israel, Vietnam, Poland, Cambodia, Lebanon, Georgia, Turkey and Lithuania are some of the few examples of countries that dollarized their economies or accepted the US dollar as legal tender. Most of these countries that dollarized have found it difficult to de-dollarize even to this day with a number of them partially dollarized. To understand the reasons why, it is critical to underline the initial causes of dollarization.  All the countries that dollarized have 3 notable push factors that are common. These are high levels of inflation (a result of either excessive money printing, quantitative easing or monetization of fiscal deficits), macroeconomic instability and low levels of public confidence in monetary institutions. Other reasons from selected countries include exchange market inefficiencies, political instability/civil unrest and sharp fall in commodity prices.  With resemblance to Zimbabwe, empirical evidence from over 30 failed attempts to de-dollarize points that local currencies issued without years of sustained economic stability, fiscal reforms, improved confidence in monetary authorities, inflation targeting measures, foreign reserves and a flexible exchange rate mechanism have all failed. A few countries quickly changed tact after notable failures and registered currency stability afterwards.  The Peruvian Experience  In the mid-1980s, the Peruvian government decided to combat dollarization induced by massive growth in money supply and inflation. The government forced conversion of foreign currency deposits into the local currency (Peruvian Sol). The policy turned out to be counter-productive as it provoked financial disintermediation and capital flight by risk averse investors.  The inflation rate reached quadruple digits in the 1990s and the Peruvian sol lost its essential functions. After this painful experiment, government authorities radically changed their de-dollarization strategy. Their new plan focused on achieving macroeconomic stability by creating a fiscal surplus, significantly lowering public debt and stabilizing inflation through the introduction of an inflation targeting regime.  This was followed by significant currency appreciation from 2003 to 2011. The macroeconomic stabilization policy was complemented by prudential regulations to better account for earned foreign currency, and to develop a market for securities with a long maturity in domestic currency. As a result, Peru managed to reduce transaction dollarization levels to below 50% and is set to achieve its 2020 de-dollarization targets.  Bolivia and Mexico Experiences  In 1982, the central Bank of Bolivia attempted to de-dollarize the economy by converting all US Dollar financial instruments to Bolivianos at an exchange rate below the market rate. To achieve this, the bank instituted interest rate caps to control capital creation, price controls to curb inflation and exchange control regulations to restrict movement of capital as witnessed in neighboring countries.  This backfired spectacularly as inflation skyrocketed. During a twelve month period (August 1984 to August 1985), prices rose by 20 000%. After the new government came into power, a comprehensive economic stabilization program was announced that included reforms in government spending, trade liberalization, privatization of state entities and institution of a managed float exchange rate.  In Mexico, the government forced a conversion of foreign currency deposits into Pesos. The result was a massive externalization of foreign currency and capital flight by investors, diminished remittances and limited financial intermediation. Central bank governance reforms were instituted with the country undergoing inflation targeting and economic stabilization policies that lasted over 10 years. Mexico succeeded in keeping its level of dollarization low at below 5.2% as at December 2007.  In all the three case studies above, it can be pointed out that market driven policies are more effective in achieving sustained de-dollarization than forced measures that include regulations and government ultimatums.  Notable success stories  Countries that have successfully de-dollarized have yielded positive results of fiscal consolidation, free market policies and persistent economic stability that cultivates trust in the financial system. In Chile, Israel, Georgia and Poland, the process began with a successful disinflation program, leading to a more flexible market driven exchange rates and a monetary policy aimed at lower inflation.

There was a problem processing your submission. Please try again later.  The success stories in the four countries show that the first step toward de-dollarization is macroeconomic stabilization. Fiscal consolidation then lessens the need for government borrowing from the central bank and a tighter monetary policy reduces credit growth. Both fiscal and monetary policies restrain aggregate demand and lead to the appreciation of the real exchange rates. It can also be observed that de-dollarization success stories followed a change in governance or policy shift to more pragmatic or market driven approaches that encompassed deregulation and privatization of state entities.  Overall, macroeconomic theory and the analysis of case studies of successful de-dollarization processes suggest that the key contributor to successful de-dollarization is a stable macroeconomic environment. Prudential measures in the banking sector can only be considered as supplementary tools. Above all, the most sustainable way in de-dollarization is to achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability by keeping inflation low and stable, keeping the exchange rate flexible to crowd in private capital, improving the country's current account balance, reversing fiscal deficits and conducting institutional reforms that attract investment.  The Zimbabwean Dollar was prematurely introduced and the government tried to use excessive regulations to force de-dollarization with limited political will in addressing key factors that led to economic instability. These include low agricultural and industrial productivity, high levels of money printing by the central bank to fund subsidies and quasi fiscal activities, low levels of public trust, high levels of corruption that feeds on public funds, high debt levels and institutional flaws on property rights and respect for rule of law. Without pragmatic efforts to address these economic fundamentals above, de-dollarization is always a tall order.  Victor Bhoroma is an economic analyst."

https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html  来源：约翰霍普金斯大学统计数据二次处理  但考虑到今年各种魔幻事件频出，以及年初各国小聋瞎式操作，说不定什么时候剧情就反转了。作为一个重度旅游爱好者，我也非常关心，什么时候能出国旅游（不是），疫情还会不会反转，来个第三波？    如何预判疫情前景？  预判疫情走势，看起来好像需要用到各国的政策情况和病毒扩散指数等等做建模预测。  但作为一个生活娱乐类博主（大雾），我想提供一个虽然不那么严谨但更简便直观的方法：看看疫情新增趋势和复工复产趋势的关系吧。  从中国抗疫经验和科学研究两个角度，都已经验证了社交隔离对疫情控制的有效性。如果各国抄中国作业，彻底剿灭疫情再复工复产，那也许不会有第三波；如果等不及剿灭疫情就着急复工复产，那第三波就挡不住了。考虑到各国在第一波疫情期间的各种魔幻操作，这第三波，还真不好说。  疫情趋势可以用约翰霍普金斯大学的统计数据。那么如何衡量复工复产趋势呢？  复工复产，最直接的表现就是出行。正因为疫情期间街上空空荡荡，人流和车流的恢复就会变得异常明显。千里之外，测算人流量很难，车流呢？有没有一款软件或者一种数据可以简单衡量各国的车流呢？  于是我们想到了：      Uber作为全世界每个月都有1亿用户【2】在用的打车软件，以它的数据来作为参考确实是不错的选择。  这里我们收集了Uber的出车量数据。具体做法是：模拟用户在Uber上叫车，每天扫描全城数十次，在每个角落模拟叫车，找出在营业的车辆，再统计车辆数量的总和。  Uber界面，来源：http://geeksincambodia.com/uber-cambodia-gm-explains-his-favorite-in-app-safety-features/    Uber的出车量数据有了，这个数据的趋势能不能作为复工复产趋势的方向性指针呢？  作为一个严谨的数据向博主，得找个国家验证下。这里我们挑个民众比较热情且政府管制不力的南美国家：哥伦比亚。  哥伦比亚今年以「黑社会抗疫」闻名于世。国内政府军和非法武装持续对线battle多年，但随着疫情形势越来越严峻，双方不得不握手言和联手抗疫。  一方面，政府已强制要求隔离到7月中【3】。另一方面，非法武装分子更为激进，4月传出新闻，武装分子干掉了不遵守抗疫规定前往公园的市民，8月，又传出新闻《哥伦比亚50人疫情期间聚会遭到武装分子扫射，9人死亡多人受伤，幸存者声称依靠装死才逃过一劫》【4】。  所以，我们已知7月到8月哥伦比亚的社交活动在减少。查一下Uber出车量，果然一个月下滑了13%，方向与社交活动相符。    图片来源：Uber数据二次处理    哪国疫情前景最糟？  那我们把全球各国的Uber数据统计一下。  从全球范围来看，新增确诊的拐点虽然尚待观察，但Uber出车量在七八月间先放后收，如果保持谨慎，有望避免全球性第三波大爆发。    来源：约翰霍普金斯大学统计数据二次处理，Uber  但搞数据的都知道，平均数有时候不太靠谱，你和马云老师平均资产接近250亿【5】，毫无意义。何况，从川普老师的「coronavirus will disappear one day like a miracle」到英国的「群体免疫」，各国的迷幻操作一波接一波，说不准后面就突然昏招频出，掉一波节奏。  全球抗疫是存在时间差的，此消彼长，因此，疫情在局部地区爆发，并导致全球总确诊继续上扬是完全有可能的。那谁最有可能爆？  我们决定锁定新增确诊五大强国，按确诊增量和Uber增量，看看各国七八月都什么操作。这五个国家是：美国，印度，巴西，南非，哥伦比亚。  数据来源：Uber，约翰霍普金斯大学疫情统计，https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases  巧了，五个国家代表了四种策略。我们这里概括为头铁组，试探组，老实组和龟缩组。      右上角：头铁组，疫情在恶化，Uber复苏也很强劲，司机和乘客天天顶着疫情出街，赌的就是一个薛定谔的阳性，非常刚。  右下角：试探组，疫情在缓解，开始考虑抓GDP，谨慎复工，Uber开始复苏，社会运转尝试走上正轨。  左上角：老实组，疫情在扩散，Uber出车量在收缩，复工复产也遥遥无期。  左下角：龟缩组，疫情得到控制，但Uber出车量也没有明显增长，苟住要紧。  这么一看，答案就很明显了：贡献了第二多的新增确诊，且国内逐渐「重启」的印度，成功slay全场，进入我们的视线。    图片来源：http://www.ifuun.com/a2019081520369751/  哥伦比亚黑帮出面抗疫虽然有些魔幻，但好歹有效，成功抑制住了疫情涨势。而印度当前累计确诊病例超200万【1】，仅次于美国和巴西，高居第三，且从趋势图上看，越来越严重。  来源：https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases  印度突破100万病例，花了5个半月，但从100万例到200万例，仅用了3周，进入指数级爆发阶段。医疗资源短缺，卫生习惯迷幻，向农村地区蔓延等等问题给抗疫造成了进一步的困难。印度一些社区还排挤感染者，导致人们抵触做检测，再加上雨季到来导致交通不便和灾害多发，使得疫情防控在这些地区难上加难。  印度危矣。    印度Uber数据藏着什么细思极恐的细节？  我们在Uber里面抄车牌的时候，还记录了每辆车的类型。像滴滴打车一样，Uber的车型五花八门，包括普通UberX，尊享UberBlack，拼车UberPool, 出租车Taxi，加长UberXL等等。  而在印度的Uber数据中，我们看到了一个很新鲜的车型：MOTO。  原来，这就是Uber在印度因地制宜的网约摩托车！    图片来源：https://www.pearvideo.com/video_1642917    在印度，载人摩托是可以网约的出行服务。用Uber把车叫来，戴上前一个乘客刚刚摘下来的头盔，贴紧车手坐稳，就可以出发了。    图片来源：https://www.businessinsider.in/this-belgian-ad-agency-is-trying-to-turn-the-tables-on-the-nsa-the-brief/articleshow/30293924.cms  从数据上看，Uber轿车复工了，Uber MOTO也跟着复工了。比起汽车狭小的密闭空间，摩托车上趋近于零距离的接触，加上陌生乘客间共享的头盔，感染的风险也更大。    来源：Uber数据  当前Moto出车量约只占到Uber总体出车量的1%~2%，但如果印度出现类似日本司机的「超级感染者」案例，一城一地瞬间告急，立刻能推高疫情，C位出道。  疫情中的印度为何头铁？  或许世界银行的这组数据可以说明问题：抗疫2个月，印度经济遭受重创，4月印度失业率飙升至23%【8】，相较1-2月份翻了不止一番。眼看着失业率还要继续翻下去，面临着抗疫期如此巨大的经济压力，从国家的角度，在「大规模失业-社会必然动荡」和 「复工-疫情可能爆发」之间，选择了后者。而6月开启复工之后，失业率果然有所缓解。  2019-2020年，印度失业率趋势，来源：https://zh.tradingeconomics.com/india/unemployment-rate  复工之际，防疫措施也是有的，Uber已经推出了一系列措施，包括强制口罩，无现金支付减少接触，塑料布隔离开乘客和司机。而与Uber同为出行服务的Ola公司，甚至要求乘客自己装卸行李以减少接触。但对于司机这样的高危群体来讲，每次出车，还是有赌的成分了。

这里我们又找到了一份塔塔社会科学研究所出的印度出行平台【9】司机的人群画像报告，报告里是这么描述典型Uber司机群体的：  平均年龄为32岁，家庭成员2~5个，80%是印度教徒，70%的受访者属于较低种姓。70%的受访者接受中学及以下教育。  这些数据意味着什么呢？  普遍来讲，Uber司机面临着巨大的生活压力，他们需要供养1-3个孩子（可能还有家里的全职太太），并不高的文化程度和对宗教的忠诚可能会导致他们的防疫意识薄弱。多种因素的推动之下，他们不得不冒着感染风险走上复工的道路。  也就是说，现在看上去貌似「最头铁」开始复工的人，其实是在「被迫头铁」。  图片来源：unsplash  作为恒河孕育出的人民，印度人在对待各种事情上都颇有「神学」色彩，从恒河水治愈新冠到塑料布防疫，金句频出。但关于防疫的调侃梗越多，反而越让人担忧。对于普通民众，一方面，他们没有学会在病毒面前采取科学手段保护自己，另一方面，他们又急切地复工复产，这才是让第二次疫情爆发成为印度头上悬着的「达摩克利斯之剑」的真正原因。  总之，在传染性和致病性都很强的致命病毒这样外挂般的「地球橡皮擦」面前，人的抵抗力还是薄弱的。像美国/印度等国，在疫情早期没有及时采纳检测-隔离-再检测-迅速隔离这样有效的抗疫模式，后期只能被动拉长抗疫时间。但是拉长战线的方式，无疑会在一定程度上影响民众长期的收入，甚至对部分行业造成灭霸式攻击，切断这些行业内从业者的经济来源，最终形成抗疫--收入降低--人民渴望复工--复工--疫情复发--再抗疫的恶性循环。最终还是「兴，百姓苦，亡，百姓苦」罢了。

(Sean Chiu / Wikimedia Commons)  Women and their reproductive health are at the center of one of the most severe humanitarian crises in recent memory. Yet, while some may have heard of the persecution of China’s Uyghur minority, the gendered campaign of forced birth control, which many experts say indicates a serious risk of genocide, is less understood. It is a clear violation of international law—but what is less clear is the path forward for accountability.  In November 2019, 403 pages of internal documents from China’s ruling Communist Party were leaked to the global community. They detailed how authorities have corralled as many as a million ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs and others into internment camps and prisons over the past three years. Survivors of the camps claim to have experienced extreme conditions, including torture.  Who Are the Uyghurs?  The Uyghurs are a mostly Muslim Turkic ethnicity who regard themselves as culturally and ethnically related to Central Asian nations. There are approximately 11 million Uyghurs in Xinjiang, a Western region that has been under the control of China since it was annexed in 1949.  A History of Systematic Violence Against Uyghurs in China  Uyghurs have long faced economic marginalization and political discrimination as an ethnic minority. As early as 2009, Human Rights Watch has reported disappearances of Uyghur men after an influx of asylum applications from neighboring countries came in from Uyghur citizens of Xinjiang.  In 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping stepped up a nationwide campaign promoting conformity to the Communist Party doctrine and Han Chinese cultural norms. Under the guise of an “anti-terrorism” campaign, the internment camps and re-education centers—recently referred to as “boarding schools” by Chinese authorities—began to emerge. The campaign was fueled by unconfirmed rumors of Uyghurs going abroad to join the so-called Islamic State.  Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, Uyghur internment camps and re-education centers began to emerge. (Luci Harrison Photography / Flickr)  These reports became the pretext for President Xi’s regulations targeting cultural, political, and religious minorities. New laws began to surface limiting religious practice like prayer and outlawing things like beards, burkas, and face veils—all associated in Xinjiang with the Muslim faith.  Here at Ms., our team is continuing to report through this global health crisis—doing what we can to keep you informed and up-to-date on some of the most underreported issues of this pandemic. We ask that you consider supporting our work to bring you substantive, unique reporting—we can’t do it without you. Support our independent reporting and truth-telling for as little as $5 per month.  Flashforward to 2020: Students are coming home from their exam periods to find their families missing, men are being transported to work hard labor in factories, and others are being detained in multiple locations across Xinjiang. Local officials have scripts for what to tell residents when a loved one goes missing. There are reports that police have ordered a sweep of 40 percent of the adult population. Those that find themselves in an internment camp experience and witness torture in the form of electric shock, water torture, loss of appendages, and being forced to sit on a chair made of nails.  Uyghur Women Particularly at Risk  That all being said, women are especially affected by this campaign of persecution.  Recent reports document plans for forced IUD placement, mandated abortions, and sterilizations and injections that have been reported to cease menstruation cycles.  Uyghur women deemed to have too many children are forced into labor camps for “training purposes.” For example, a Uyghur woman from Urumqi paid a fine for having had three instead of two children and was offered free surgical sterilization. At first this was a suggestion, but later she was threatened that if she did not submit to the procedure, she would be placed in an internment facility.  Another woman, a Uyghur mother of triplets, said that during detention she and other women were given unknown drugs and injections that caused irregular bleeding and a loss of their menstruation cycle. U.S. doctors later confirmed that she had been sterilized.  These measures of “forced birth control” are some of the ways in which Chinese authorities in Xinjiang are utilizing and exploiting women’s reproductive health to further their goal of controlling and potentially destroying the Uyghur population.  What Can Be Done?  The path to individual and state accountability for the crime of mass forced sterilization is not straightforward. A recent series of articles from human rights experts details the complexity of an international response to the situation. China does not accept the jurisdiction of the two international courts intended to deal with such crimes—the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice, both based in The Hague.  Adding to the tragedy is the fact that the international community knows what to do when international crimes of this scale are perpetrated—just look at Rwanda, Bosnia, Libya, Sudan, Lebanon, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, Syria or Myanmar. The problem is not a lack of options; it is lack of political will. China, and the geopolitical power it wields, have muted attention and outrage.  To its credit, the United States ramped up sanctions on government entities and companies in the Xinjiang region who are involved in the mass internment of Uyghurs.  But we all know it is not enough. Only time will tell what the next move will be for the international community to take further action. But what is certain is that China is allowing a population of women to suffer at the expense of a political agenda fueled by discrimination.  We cannot allow justice to be delayed any longer. World leaders need to stand up to China to put a stop to years of impunity for genocidal policies.  The coronavirus pandemic and the response by federal, state and local authorities is fast-moving. During this time, Ms. is keeping a focus on aspects of the crisis—especially as it impacts women and their families—often not reported by mainstream media.

Here is the site.  Here again is the Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin:  I left out positivity, becaue the chart becomes unreadable if I include it. Interesting spike in Missouri; I wonder if it’s a reporting problem at the state level, since they seem to be cropping up all over.  And here is the EU, which we haven’t looked at for awhile.  I can’t add the US for comparison, because then the EU gets all smushed together at the bottom of the chart. Still, that steady rise is concerning.  ME: “Maine CDC now links 53 COVID-19 cases to Millinocket wedding reception” [Press-Herald]. “The number of COVID-19 cases connected to a wedding reception in Millinocket continues to climb, with state health officials saying on Saturday that they could trace 53 confirmed cases of coronavirus to the reception. That’s up from 32 confirmed cases on Friday. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday that investigators identified secondary and tertiary transmission of the virus, which means that it has spread to people who did not attend the Aug. 7 wedding reception but had close contact with individuals who were present at the event (secondary cases) and close contacts of the secondary cases. Big Moose Inn, which hosted the event, was cited for an “imminent health hazard,” which carries no fine but can bring harsher penalties if state officials determine the venue violated health rules again. The wedding reception had 65 people, more than the state maximum of 50 for indoor gatherings. Maine health officials have said the investigation into the wedding reception continues, including to what extent attendees were wearing masks or not wearing masks, and whether they were instructed by the Big Moose Inn to do so. Under Maine’s emergency orders to combat the spread of the coronavirus, establishments are required to enforce mask wearing in indoor public places.”  NC: “Records from before reopening show experts warned UNC of COVID-19 outbreaks” [Daily Tar Heel]. “Students, faculty and staff are saying they expected UNC to close due to COVID-19 spikes before the announcement Monday that undergraduate courses would shift to remote learning — and documents obtained by The Daily Tar Heel show that the administration received warning months ago from top medical professionals at the University….. University leaders defended their decision to reopen at an emergency Faculty Executive Committee Monday evening, with Provost Bob Blouin saying: ‘I do not apologize for trying.'”  Colleges: “‘Frats Are Being Frats’: Greek Life Is Stoking the Virus on Some Campuses” [New York Times]. “The concerns over Greek life come amid reports of virus outbreaks at fraternities and sororities across the country. Universities are struggling with how to prevent tightly packed sorority and fraternity houses from turning into coronavirus clusters…. ‘The frats are being frats: They are having their parties,’ Lamar Richards, a U.N.C. sophomore, said.”  Politics  “But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?” –James Madison, Federalist 51  “They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.” –Frank Herbert, Dune  “They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.” –Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord  The electoral map. July 17: Georgia, Ohio, ME-2 move from Leans Republican to Toss-up. Continued yikes. On July 7, the tossup were 86. Only July 17, they were 56. Now they are 91. This puts Biden at 278, i.e. over 270. August 18: Still no changes. (Last change August 10.) Despite the sturm and drang, and the polls, the consensus on the electoral college remains the same: Biden ahead, Trump within striking distance.    Click the map to create your own at 270toWin.com  So, taking the consensus as a given, 270 (total) – 204 (Trump’s) = 66. Trump must win 66 from the states in play: AZ (11), FL (29), MI (16), NC (15), PA (20), and WI (10) plus 1 to win not tie = 102. 102 – 66 = 36. So if Trump wins FL, MI, NC, and PA (29 + 16 + 15 + 20 = 80), he wins. That’s a heavy lift. I think I’ve got the math right this time!  2020  Biden (D)(1); An interesting dynamic in latest CBS poll: Only 5% of Republicans say they’re voting for Joe Biden. Right now that’s lower than the 8% of Republicans who voted for Obama in 2008, 6% of Republicans who voted for Obama in 2012, and 7% of Republicans who voted for Hillary Clinton. pic.twitter.com/gIblOm1kJB — Waleed Shahid (@_waleedshahid) August 25, 2020 Interesting, but this is a national poll; what matters is which Republicans in which districts. Further, in a close race, every little bit helps. Trump (R)(1): “How Trump betrays the working people who elected him” [Katrina vanden Heuvel, WaPo]. “This week, the real question is whether Trump can con his own followers once more. At their convention, Democrats focused on Trump’s lack of character and competence. But as despair rises, Trump’s “violation of norms” or the fact that, as his sister Maryanne Trump Barry said, he has ‘no principles,’ aren’t his greatest weaknesses. His true vulnerability is that he has betrayed those who brought him to power. Over the next 70 days, Democrats must make certain that reality doesn’t get drowned out.” • It is true that while the Eighth Circle of Hell covers Fraud, the Ninth and lowest covers Betrayal. But Hell is crowded. By contrast– Trump (R)(2): “Trump’s Fights Are Their Fights. They Have His Back Unapologetically.” [New York Times]. “In lengthy interviews over the last several weeks, a cross-section of Trump voters said they believed he had succeeded on issues like hardening the Southern border, appointing conservative judges, taking on China and putting “America first.” Many said the president’s grievances were their grievances, too. They believed kneeling during the national anthem was un-American, and they were appalled at what they viewed as liberals’ minimizing of violence that at times grew out of the protests over the killing of George Floyd. At the same time, Trump voters dismissed as irrelevant aspects of the president’s behavior that critics say make him historically unfit for office. All politicians lie, many said; as for the president’s suggestion that he might not accept the election results, supporters said voters should judge his actions, not his loose talk or tweets. ‘I didn’t vote for Trump because I wanted him to be my best friend,’ Ms. Schenkel said. ‘I wanted to make a change and a difference.’ ‘If he thinks it’s the right thing, he doesn’t care who’s going to get mad at him,’ she added. ‘I think he’s very misunderstood.’ … She grades the president highly on having met his promises, including slowing the flow of undocumented immigrants and building a strong economy before the virus struck. Other Trump supporters outlined myriad reasons for wanting to re-elect him, ranging from the pragmatic, like a new job made possible by the administration’s policies, to a gut-level attraction to his hard-nosed personality. His supporters related ‘aha’ moments in their upbringing when they realized they were conservatives, which they spoke of as nonnegotiable beliefs woven into their identity, like opposition to abortion.” • It just struck me that perhaps Arnade’s back-row kids don’t concern themselves with “identity” because they never left home; they know who they are. PMCs, who are mobile in the credential-seeking and deployment, are far more, well, fragile. * * * “Susan Rice says she is ‘100 percent’ sure Russia will interfere in elections” [The Hill]. Rice: “We need to be worried not only about Russian disinformation — its activity on social media which is constant, aimed at misleading and dividing and instilling fear and hatred between and among Americans — but we need to be concerned also about what efforts it might make again to infiltrate our voting systems, and corrupt either our voting rolls or even potentially the voting count itself.” • Thankfullly, we have experts to consuilt….  Realignment and Legitimacy  “Black, Latino lobbyists bristle at progressives pushing corporate K Street ban on Biden” [The Hill]. “A battle is brewing on K Street over an effort by progressives to ensure a Biden administration is devoid of any former Wall Street executives or corporate lobbyists. Black and Latino lobbyists say a ban of that sort would end up shutting out minorities and could make the administration less diverse if Democrats win back the White House.” • There it is. “Weakness is provocative” [Interfluidity]. “Less frequently discussed than all of that is how weak first-past-the-post voting is, with respect to resisting corruption. And weakness, Republican politicians eternally remind us, is provocative. Single-winner, first-past-the-post elections are often described as “winner-takes-all”. That means that in a close election, the leverage, the “ROI”, associated with stealing a small edge can be huge. If the ultimate margin of victory of an election is likely to be within 2%, you only have to manipulate, suppress, or steal 2% of the vote to win 100% of the power. Then we are “shocked, shocked” that political entrepreneurs with an interest in the outcome (not necessarily of the parties themselves, it could be Russia!) do play for such edges. But that’s only true for close elections, right? Yes, that’s right. But because single-winner, first-past-the-post voting yields a two-party system, we should expect that the most consequential elections will frequently be evenly matched. The two parties are strategic actors, and they want to win a struggle for power. [1] When either party’s strategy leaves it losing that struggle by a clear margin, that strategy will change, one way or another, even by poaching aspects of the other party’s identity if necessary. (Consider the realignment of the Democrats when 12 years out of power in 1992, or Republicans’ adoption of Dixiecrats.) With party institutions more eager to contend for power than they are devoted to any fixed ideology or constituency, a 50/50 divide is the equilibrium, the attractor.” • This is well worth reading in fully. “The Non-Voter” [American Compass]. “Each election there are three choices and the winner is always not voting…. Not voting is about a justified cynicism forged from a lifetime of being screwed over by the status quo, and little is more status quo than sporting a ‘I voted’ sticker. In their minds, and from their experiences, voting has no clear upside. Nothing is going to change. And it comes with downside, both explicit and implicit. Voting means entering institutions that have given them problems. From schools, where they were tested, measured, and prodded endlessly, only to be then ignored, scolded, or demeaned. To municipal buildings where they were taxed, fined, or charged…. Voting means getting further entangled with a bureaucracy that has done nothing but tangled them up. Hell, it might even come with jury duty. They can’t do that because they are working two jobs and got kids to care for.” • Also worth reading in full.  Stats Watch  At reader request, I added some business stats back in. Please give Econintersect click-throughs; they’re a good, old-school blog that covers more than stats. If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.  Housing: “S and P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20 City Home Price Index June 2020 Year-over-Year Growth Slows” [Econintersect]. “The non-seasonally adjusted S and P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index (20 cities – although only 19 cities this month) year-over-year rate of home price growth declined from 3.7 % to 3.5 %. The index authors stated, ‘More data will be required to understand whether the market resumes its previous path of accelerating prices, continues to decelerate, or remains stable.’ … All home price indices are now showing home price growth is slowing year-over-year. Most of the blame for this should be laid at the feet of the pandemic which has altered daily lives.”  * * *  Retail: “Big-box retailers loom larger than ever on the U.S. consumer landscape. Nearly six months into the coronavirus pandemic, big-box retailers are emerging as business winners” [Wall Street Journal]. “Walmart, Amazon, Target, Home Depot, Lowe’s and Costco Wholesale accounted for 29.1% of all U.S. retail sales in the second quarter, according to Customer Growth Partners, up from 25.6% in the same period a year ago. The big retailers were allowed to remain open, and critical factors in their growth included that they had already invested their online businesses, had large supply networks to restock and sophisticated transportation networks that include dedicated fleets. That advantage isn’t likely to fade. Experts say a winnowing out of the sector is likely to continue as the economy picks up steam, with big retailers leapfrogging smaller competitors.”  Supply Chain: “Work-from-home requirements are magnifying cybersecurity threats across the corporate world, raising new threats across supply chains. Packaged-foods giant Kraft-Heinz has seen attempted email attacks jump 10% to 15% since the pandemic began… with callers posing as employees or suppliers to gather information that could help them launch more sophisticated attacks” [Wall Street Journal]. “A Kraft Heinz official says callas may pretend to be a supplier who needs to confirm account credentials to process payment. With around half the U.S. workforce now working remotely, makeshift workplaces that depend on laptops, Zoom meetings and other porous technology are proving inviting targets.”  Finance: “Hedge Fund Collects $3 Billion in Bet on Wildfire Insurance Claims” [Insurance Journal]. “Baupost Group, the hedge fund run by Seth Klarman, received more than $3 billion in July from its bet on insurance claims against PG&E Corp. connected to a series of deadly California wildfires, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The payout yielded Baupost’s biggest profit generator last month and represented a sizable markup from what the firm had anticipated, it told investors Thursday. The fund bought $6.8 billion of subrogation claims against PG&E, court documents show. Baupost acquired some of the claims at about 35 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg previously reported, so its profit on the trade could have approached $1 billion. But the gains were partly offset by losses on the firm’s equity holdings in the utility company, one of the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.”  * * *  Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 74 Greed (previous close: 72 Greed) [CNN]. One week ago: 70 (Greed). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed). Last updated Aug 25 at 11:57am.  The Biosphere  “Ancient megadrought may explain civilization’s ‘missing millennia’ in Southeast Asia” [Science]. “A megadrought that lasted more than 1000 years may have plagued Southeast Asia 5000 years ago, setting up dramatic shifts in regional civilizations, suggests a new study of cave rocks in northern Laos. The researchers believe the drought began when the drying of the distant Sahara Desert disrupted monsoon rains and triggered droughts throughout the rest of Asia and Africa. For years, archaeologists studying mainland Southeast Asia—an area encompassing modern-day Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam—have been puzzled by what they call “the missing millennia,” a period from roughly 6000 to 4000 years ago with little evidence of human settlements. University of Pennsylvania archaeologist Joyce White, a co-author on the new paper, says she and others long thought this was because researchers hadn’t yet pinpointed where people of the era lived. Now, she believes the settlements could be missing because a megadrought devastated their populations and drove them to find water elsewhere.” • Yikes….  Health Care  “To Test Spread of Coronavirus, These Scientists Put on a Concert” [New York Times]. “[V]olunteers in an elaborate study by a team at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg called Restart 19. Each attendee, outfitted with a digital location tracker and hand disinfectant laced with fluorescent dye, were carefully positioned on seats as part of one of the first experiments by scientists to track the risks of coronavirus infection posed by large, indoor events. Researchers hope to use their results to determine which elements of events like this pose the greatest risk for transmission and help create guidelines for limiting such dangers and safely restarting live performances around the world…. ‘We know the personal contacts at the concert are risky, but we don’t know where they happen,’ [Dr. Stefan Moritz] said. ‘Is it at the entrance? Is it at the bleachers?’ Dr. Moritz concluded that the best way to bring in reliable data would be to stage an actual concert…. Dr. Moritz said that the most intriguing finding likely would be related to aerosol spread . Scientists have recently confirmed that the virus can remain suspended in the air, possibly for hours in closed environments. ‘It’s so weird what happens with these movements of air,’ he said. ‘Things you wouldn’t expect.’ To simulate the spread of aerosols in the arena on Saturday, staff used a smoke machine to emit a cloud of fog into the rafters. It drifted upward before moving into a spiral shape and spreading toward the audience.” • Important! (And it should be possible to scale this testing out to any interior space, both when they are being architected, and after they have been constructed.)  “Starbucks Cafe’s Covid Outbreak Spared Employees Who Wore Masks” [Bloomberg]. “After a woman with the coronavirus visited a Starbucks cafe north of Seoul this month, more than two dozen patrons tested positive days later. But the four face mask-wearing employees escaped infection. The Aug. 8 outbreak in the South Korean city of Paju is another example of how rapidly the SARS-CoV-2 virus can spread in confined, indoor spaces — as well as ways to minimize transmission. With health authorities around the world still debating the evidence around face masks, the 27-person cluster linked to the air-conditioned coffee outlet adds more support for their mandatory use to help limit the spread of the Covid-19-causing virus.” • Unfortunately, one must remove one’s mask to drink coffee — the purpose for which one goes to Starbucks — so masks as such aren’t really the answer here. (Of course, one could get one’s coffee to go, but that’s hardly the point of a café.) So I hope somebody is thinking very hard about aerosol transmission, HVAC — and also humidity.  “New drool-based tests are replacing the dreaded coronavirus nasal swab” [Science]. “First, a technician pushes a pencil-length swab to the very back of your nasal passages. Then you pay $100 or more, and wait days for an answer. But faster, cheaper, more pleasant ways to test for the novel coronavirus are coming online. This month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for two tests that sample saliva instead of nasal fluid, and more innovations are likely after FDA relaxed rules to allow new tests to be adopted more quickly. One candidate was announced last week: an experimental test, potentially faster and cheaper, that analyzes saliva in a new way…. On 4 August, the Yale team posted a preprint on medRxiv that said its saliva test agreed with swab results 94% of the time, at a cost of as little as $1.29 per sample, roughly 1/100 as much as commercial swab-based tests. On 15 August, FDA granted emergency approval for the SalivaDirect test, so that other FDA-approved labs can use the protocol. Last week, the agency extended approval to the UIUC test given its similarity to the Yale test. UIUC is now using its saliva test to test all 60,000 students, faculty, and staff twice a week, so they can isolate infected individuals as quickly as possible. “Testing saliva makes sense scientifically, and it makes sense logistically,” Hergenrother says.” • Notice how a protocol allowed test development to scale out rapidly.  “Overrun with COVID-19, one nursing home managed to dodge the worst” [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (a different chris)]. “The tiny nursing home was being overrun with COVID-19: over the next few days, 27 residents tested positive, along with two dozen staff members…. Remarkably, everyone recovered from the virus at Quality Life Services-Mercer, including a 101-year-old man, defying the odds stacked against a group of elderly people, most with chronic health problems who have the highest mortality rates…. Elias Shattahi, an infectious disease specialist at Sharon Regional Medical Center, 13 miles from the Mercer nursing home, said how well an elderly COVID-19 patient fares turns on chronic health conditions they may have, including such things as high blood pressure, advanced age and dementia. But he was flummoxed by what happened at Quality Life Services. ‘I can not explain it,’ said Dr. Shattahi…. ‘That’s a million-dollar question.'”  Class Warfare  “What ‘Capitalism’ Is and How It Affects People” [Teen Vogue]. “Capitalism is defined as an economic system in which a country’s trade, industry, and profits are controlled by private companies, instead of by the people whose time and labor powers those companies. The United States and many other nations around the world are capitalist countries, but capitalism is not the only economic system available…. The kind of impact that capitalism has on your life depends on whether you’re a worker or a boss. …. There are many forms of socialism, but at its core, socialism is an economic system in which a whole community — not just bosses or private companies — control the means of production equally….

Key points: The Government wants Australia's neighbours in the Pacific and South-East Asia to have affordable access to any vaccine  The Government wants Australia's neighbours in the Pacific and South-East Asia to have affordable access to any vaccine It will spend $80 million on a global effort to distribute a successful vaccine to poorer countries  It will spend $80 million on a global effort to distribute a successful vaccine to poorer countries The funding will be reallocated from existing foreign aid programs  Several countries — including Canada, Italy and the United Kingdom — have already made commitments to the COVAX AMC, a finance mechanism designed to ensure large pharmaceutical companies supply developing nations with affordable doses of a coronavirus vaccine.  The initiative is being coordinated by the international vaccine alliance GAVI, which has been pressing major philanthropists, wealthy countries and the pharmaceutical industry for support.  In a statement, Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Health Minister Greg Hunt said Australia wanted to ensure any future COVID-19 vaccines were ""safe, effective and affordable"", particularly for countries in the broader region.  ""By supporting the COVAX AMC, Australia will help secure COVID-19 vaccines for Pacific Island and South-East Asian countries,"" the ministers said.  ""The AMC will address the acute phase of the pandemic, providing doses for up to 20 per cent of countries' populations in its first phase, ensuring that healthcare workers and vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, have access.""  Advanced trials are underway for some vaccine candidates. ( Reuters: Amanda Perobelli )  The Federal Government also argues a vaccine will be crucial to ensuring the region's economic recovery in the wake of the pandemic.  Aid groups have welcomed the pledge, but are unhappy that the $80 million will be drawn from the existing aid budget.  ""It is deeply disappointing that this will come from existing budgets. This risks development gains and compromises existing partnerships in the region,"" Marc Purcell from the Australian Council for International Development said.  ""The aid program has seen more slicing and dicing than a chef's kitchen. New resources are required.""  The AMC will be open to developing countries around the globe. The Federal Government says Pacific countries eligible for support include Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Kiribati.  The eligible countries from South-East Asia are Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, The Philippines and Vietnam.  COVAX AMC has already raised more than $US600 million ($836 million), and wants to secure seed funding of $US2 billion by the end of the year.  The Government has separately made a broader pledge of $300 million in funding for GAVI over a five-year period from 2021 to 2025 — an increase from the $250 million it provided between 2016 and 2020.  The Prime Minister has also flagged an agreement to secure a vaccine currently being trialled by UK-based drug company AstraZeneca.  Scott Morrison said Australia might also distribute that vaccine to Pacific Island and South-East Asian countries if the Government is able to ramp up local production.  Global debate over COVID-19 drugs has intensified in recent months as several nations — including the United States, Russia and China — pour billions of dollars into the race for a working vaccine.  The United Nations secretary-general has repeatedly warned countries they should note hoard vaccine stocks for their own citizens alone or use a working vaccine as a diplomatic bargaining chip."

Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi also confirmed at their meeting in Naypyidaw that they would speed up talks to facilitate short-term business travel, while taking measures to combat the virus, according to the Foreign Ministry.  Motegi, in his final stop on a four-nation tour since Thursday, told reporters online that his country's pledges of economic and medical support to leaders in the respective countries demonstrated that ""Japan leads international cooperation efforts"" in fighting the pandemic.  The tour also included Papua New Guinea, Laos and Cambodia.  The visits to the countries came as Japan, which currently bans in principle entry by foreign nationals from 146 countries and regions, launched talks with 16 economies, including Myanmar, to resume travel in tandem with the restart of domestic socioeconomic activities.  Besides Myanmar, Japan agreed with Cambodia and Laos over the weekend and with Singapore and Malaysia earlier this month to allow reciprocal travel of long-term residents as early as September.  Under the arrangements, long-term residents are allowed to travel on condition they stay at home or at a designated place for 14 days after arrival and take steps to reduce the risk of infection.  At the talks with Suu Kyi, Motegi also pledged loans of ¥30 billion ($283 million) to the Myanmar government as emergency budget support and ¥15 billion to support small and medium-sized firms amid the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, the ministry said.  The fresh provisions came on top of virus-related aid worth over $30 million that Japan has administered to Myanmar, including the provision of medical supplies such as the antiviral drug Avigan, a potential coronavirus treatment drug manufactured by a unit of Fujifilm Holdings Corp., it said.  Motegi also said to reporters, ""The leaders and I shared an understanding over the South China Sea issue,"" referring to the maritime areas where tensions are high amid China's rising military assertiveness. He did not elaborate further.  The foreign minister added that he had ""gained their understanding and support for a free and open Indo-Pacific (region) that Japan is actively promoting.""  In the meeting, Motegi also noted the importance of Myanmar ""steadily implementing"" the provisional order issued by the International Court of Justice in January requiring it to take ""all measures"" to end the persecution of the country's Rohingya ethnic minority by the Myanmar military, the ministry said.  Regarding that issue, Motegi told reporters he had spoken to Suu Kyi about Japan's continuing support for Myanmar's efforts to improve the situation in Rakhine state, from which Rohingya Muslims have fled to take refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. He said Suu Kyi responded by saying she would make efforts to do so as much as possible.  More than 740,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from the western Myanmar state to Bangladesh since 2017 in the wake of a brutal crackdown against insurgents by Myanmar's armed forces. Their return to their native state remains slow amid concern of violence.  Motegi also stated Japan's ""full-fledged support"" for Myanmar's democratic nation building, and an election observer mission is set to be dispatched to the Nov. 8 general election in Myanmar, the ministry said.  Motegi also met with Min Aung Hlaing, commander-in-chief of the Myanmar military.

COVAX currently has the world's largest and most diverse COVID-19 vaccine portfolio - including nine candidate vaccines, with a further nine under evaluation and conversations underway with other.  COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization (WHO) - working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower->  In order to be able to secure enough doses of vaccines to protect the most vulnerable populations, such as health workers and the elderly, the next step for the partnership is to confirm potential self-financing participants' intent to participate by 31 August and to turn these into binding commitments to join the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX Facility) by 18th of September, with first upfront payments to follow thereafter, and no later than 9th of October 2020.  ""Equal access to a COVID-19 vaccine is the key to beating the virus and paving the way for recovery from the pandemic,"" said Stefan Löfven, Prime Minister of Sweden. ""This cannot be a race with a few winners, and the COVAX Facility is an important part of the solution - making sure all countries can benefit from access to the world's largest portfolio of candidates and fair and equitable distribution of vaccine doses.""  The COVAX Facility is a Gavi-coordinated pooled procurement mechanism for new COVID-19 vaccines, through which COVAX will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for each participating economy, using an allocation framework currently being formulated by WHO. The COVAX Facility will do this by pooling buying power from participating economies and providing volume guarantees across a range of promising vaccine candidates, allowing those vaccine manufacturers whose expertise is essential to large scale production of the new vaccines, to make early, at-risk investments in manufacturing capacity - providing participating countries and economies with the best chance at rapid access to doses of a successful COVID-19 vaccine.  The success of COVAX hinges not only on countries signing up to the COVAX Facility, but also filling key funding gaps for both COVAX R&D work and a mechanism to support participation of lower-income economies in the COVAX Facility.  ""COVID-19 is an unprecedented global health challenge that can only be met with unprecedented cooperation between governments, researchers, manufacturers and multilateral partners,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. ""By pooling resources and acting in solidarity through the ACT Accelerator and the COVAX Facility, we can ensure that once a vaccine is available for COVID-19, it's available equitably to all countries.""  CEPI is leading COVAX vaccine research and development work, which aims to develop three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. Nine candidate vaccines are currently being supported by CEPI; seven of which are currently in clinical trials. Governments, vaccine manufacturers (in addition to their own R&D), organizations and individuals have committed US$ 1.4 billion towards vaccine R&D so far, but an additional US$1 billion is urgently needed to continue to move the portfolio forward.  A further nine candidates vaccines which complement the current CEPI portfolio are currently being evaluated for inclusion in COVAX. Furthermore, COVAX will consider procuring vaccines that complement the portfolio from any producer in the world; conversations are already underway with a number of additional manufacturers not receiving R&D support from CEPI to procure their vaccines if they are successful. Maximizing the portfolio of vaccines increases the probability of success as individual vaccines historically have a high failure rate.  ""In the scramble for a vaccine, countries can act alone - creating a few winners, and many losers - or they can come together to participate in COVAX, an initiative which is built on enlightened self-interest but also equity, leaving no country behind,"" said Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI. ""Only by taking a global view can we protect those most at risk around the world from the terrible effects of this disease. COVAX can deliver the vaccines that could end the pandemic, but it needs countries to step forward both to join the COVAX Facility, and also to address the serious funding shortfalls, including for R&D. The decisions that are taken now about COVID-19 vaccines have the power to change our future. We must be courageous and ambitious in striving for a multilateral solution.""  A collaboration between Serum Institute of India (SII), Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced earlier this month will ensure up to 100 million doses of AstraZeneca or Novavax's candidate vaccines, if successful, will be available to low- and middle-income economies through the COVAX Facility at just US$ 3 per dose. The arrangement also provides an option to secure additional doses if COVAX sees a need for it. Separate agreements between Gavi, CEPI and AstraZeneca, announced in June, guarantee a further 300 million doses of their candidate vaccine, if successful, for the COVAX Facility.  In addition, in June Gavi launched the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC), a financing instrument aimed at supporting the participation of 92 lower and middle income economies in the COVAX Facility. The COVAX AMC has raised more than US$ 600 million against an initial target of securing US$ 2 billion seed funding from sovereign donors as well as philanthropy and the private sector, needed by the end of 2020. Funding the COVAX AMC will be critical to ensuring ability to pay is not a barrier to accessing COVID-19 vaccines, a situation which would leave the majority of the world unprotected, with the pandemic and its impact continuing unabated.  80 higher-income economies, which would finance the vaccines from their own public finance budgets, have so far submitted Expressions of Interest ahead of the 31 of August deadline for confirmation of intent to participate. They will partner with 92 low- and middle-income countries that will be supported by the AMC if it meets its funding targets. Together, this group of 172 countries represents more than 70% of the world's population. Among the group are representatives from every continent and more than half of the world's G20 economies.  ""The momentum we are witnessing behind this unprecedented global effort means there could be light at the end of the tunnel: A vaccine is our best route to ending the acute phase of the pandemic and the COVAX effort is the best way to get there,"" said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. ""For higher-income countries it represents a win-win: not only will you be guaranteed access to the world's largest portfolio of vaccines, you will also be negotiating as part of a global consortium, bringing down prices and ensuring truly global access. Signing up to the COVAX Facility gives each country its best chance at protecting the most vulnerable members of their populations - which in turn gives the world its best chance at mitigating the toll this pandemic has taken on individuals, communities and the global economy. To make this end-to-end vision a reality, we need countries to make end-to-end commitments: funding R&D, signing up to the Facility, and supporting the COVAX AMC.""  The COVAX Facility is coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and forms a key part of COVAX - the vaccines pillar of the ACT Accelerator, a ground-breaking global collaboration involving vaccine manufacturers to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. The overall aim of COVAX is to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world. It will achieve this by sharing the risks associated with vaccine development, and where necessary investing in manufacturing upfront so vaccines can be deployed at scale as soon as they are proven to be safe and effective, and pooling procurement and purchasing power to achieve sufficient volumes to end the acute phase of the pandemic by 2021.  The goal of COVAX is by the end of 2021 to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification. These vaccines will be offered equally to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, initially prioritising healthcare workers then expanding to cover vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. Further doses will then be made available based on country need, vulnerability and COVID-19 threat. The COVAX Facility will also maintain a buffer of doses for emergency and humanitarian use, including dealing with severe outbreaks before they spiral out of control.  ---------------------------------------------  The full list of CEPI-supported candidate vaccines is as follows:  Inovio, United States of America (Phase I/II)  Moderna, United States of America (Phase III)  CureVac, Germany (Phase I)  Institut Pasteur/Merck/Themis, France/ United States of America /Austria (Preclinical)  AstraZeneca/University of Oxford, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Phase III)  University of Hong Kong, China (Preclinical)  Novavax, United States of America (Phase I/II)  Clover Biopharmaceuticals, China (Phase I)  University of Queensland/CSL, Australia (Phase I)  The nine candidate vaccines that are currently being evaluated for inclusion in the COVAX Facility include two from China, two from the United States of America, one from the People's Republic of Korea, one from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and one global, multi-manufacture partnership.

Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam are first in line to get the vaccine, Premier Li Keqiang told the third Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) leaders' meeting, held online due to Covid-19 constraints, Chinese state media reported.  He added China would set up special public health funds under Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Special Fund, and continue to provide Mekong countries anti-epidemic and technical support.  Li promoted cooperation in fighting the pandemic, saying China is ready to support the World Health Organization.  On August 22, China granted emergency use authorization to multiple Covid-19 vaccines developed by domestic drug makers. For now, it has only supplied these vaccines to those at high-risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, including front-line medical staff and border guards.  In the near future, the vaccine program will be expanded to staff in the sectors of transportation, service, and vendors to ""first build an immunity barrier among special population groups"" to prevent a wave of infections in the fall and winter, Zheng Zhongwei, head of China’s coronavirus vaccine development program, told Chinese state TV Saturday.  Yet China’s latest vaccine developments are viewed with doubt, with Papua New Guinea recently saying it had turned back a group of Chinese miners who had received an experimental coronavirus vaccine.  Researchers around the world have been developing 150 potential vaccines, of which eight types have proceeded to end-stage clinical trials. Only two vaccines have been approved (mass and emergency) in Russia and China.  Vietnam’s Health Ministry said earlier this month it had registered to buy the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia.  The ministry said it had also registered to buy the vaccine being developed by the U.K. and was cooperating with other vaccine producers worldwide, including in the U.S., to seek assistance in the production of a Covid-19 vaccine in Vietnam.  Vietnamese labs are working hard to get a Covid-19 vaccine ready for clinical trial by the end of this year.  Covid-19 vaccines produced by four Vietnamese institutions – Vaccine and Biological Production No. 1 (VABIOTECH), the Center for Research and Production of Vaccines and Biologicals (POLYVAC), the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC), and Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology – have shown positive initial results.  The ministry had said earlier Vietnam aims to have a Covid-19 vaccine by 2021.  Since July 25, when Vietnam's first local Covid-19 transmission in over three months was recorded in Da Nang, outbreaks have occurred in 15 localities, with 540 domestic infections as of Tuesday morning.  The nation has so far reported 27 Covid-19 deaths."

Black rats were identified as the source of infection for humans, but reservoir animals for other genotypes remain unknown.  We retrospectively analyzed 24 Leptospira strains from human patients as well as isolated and characterized three Leptospira strains from black rats using the microscopic agglutination test with antisera for 19 serovars and multilocus sequence typing. The isolates were identified as Leptospira borgpetersenii sequence types (STs) 143 and 144; L. interrogans STs 30, 34, 43, 44, 74, 75, 80, 308, 313, 314, 316, and 317; and L. kirschneri ST318. Six of the 15 STs were identified for the first time in this study. Five serogroups such as Autumnalis, Grippotyphosa, Hebdomadis, Javanica, and Pyrogenes were detected among the isolates. Contrary to previous studies, various genotypes including novel STs were isolated during an outbreak in Southern Province. L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica ST143 was isolated both from a human and black rat.  Leptospirosis is an important but largely under-recognized public health problem in the tropics. It is a re-emerging disease and outbreaks of leptospirosis have been frequently reported in Sri Lanka. Most of the cases, however, were clinically diagnosed, and Leptospira serotypes and genotypes currently prevailing in the country remain unknown. For the prevention of leptospirosis, doxycycline prophylaxis and health education (early medical help, use of protective wear, etc) are implemented in farmers, which is the highest risk group, in endemic areas. In the present study, we revealed that genetically diverse Leptospira strains presently cause human leptospirosis in this country. Novel STs were isolated during an outbreak in Southern Province and may be related to the recent surge in leptospirosis patients with new clinical entities. The emergence of new STs also implies the importance of strict quarantine for imported domestic animals that are potential reservoirs of Leptospira spp. as well as the unintentional introduction of rodent reservoirs and the existence of unidentified reservoir animals in this country. New information from this study will be valuable in future research for patient management and specific targeted control approaches for reservoir hosts in the prevention and control of leptospirosis in Sri Lanka.  Leptospirosis is a re-emerging disease in Sri Lanka and has gained much attention since the large outbreak in 2008 [ 6 ]. A recent systematic review indicated that the cumulative annual incidence of leptospirosis that required hospitalization from 2008 to 2015 was 52.1 per 100,000 people, with an estimated case fatality ratio of 7.0% [ 7 ]. A wide array of new clinical entities such as pulmonary hemorrhage, pancreatitis, and myocarditis with high case fatality were seen in recent outbreaks [ 8 – 11 ]. Most of the cases, however, were clinically diagnosed, and some were diagnosed serologically by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) using a non-pathogenic Leptospira strain Patoc I [ 12 ]. Recent studies performed MAT using a panel of Leptospira serovars and detected antibodies to various leptospiral serovars in human patients, rodents, and cattle [ 11 , 13 – 15 ]. In addition, recent molecular investigations detected L. borgpetersenii, L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, and L. weilii in clinical samples of febrile human patients and regional differences of predominant Leptospira species in the country [ 13 , 15 – 18 ]. Leptospira DNAs belonging to L. borgpetersenii, L. interrogans, and L. kirschneri have been recently detected in cattle kidney or urine samples collected in distinct areas [ 14 , 19 ]. Although Leptospira strains were isolated from humans, rodents, shrews, and dogs in 1960s and early 1970s [ 20 , 21 ], only one report of culture isolation of L. interrogans unidentified serogroups has been published in Sri Lanka during the past 40 years [ 22 ]. Therefore, Leptospira genotypes and serotypes currently prevailing in the country remain largely unknown.  Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic spirochaetes of Leptospira spp. belonging to subclades P1 and P2 [ 1 – 4 ]. Human leptospirosis is an acute febrile illness with an extremely broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild influenza-like illness to severe disease forms characterized by jaundice, bleeding, renal failure, and death [ 1 , 3 ]. Approximately one million cases and 58,900 deaths of leptospirosis are estimated to occur worldwide each year, more than 70% of which are reported from the tropical, poorest regions of the world [ 5 ]. Pathogenic Leptospira spp. colonize the proximal renal tubules and are excreted in the urine of reservoir animals [ 1 , 3 ]. Human leptospirosis is primarily transmitted by exposure to water or soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals [ 1 , 3 ].  DNA was extracted from 0.5 ml cultures of the isolates using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Partial flaB sequence was amplified with TaKaRa Ex Taq Hot Start Version (Takara Bio, Japan) using primers L-flaB-F1 (5′-CTCACCGTTCTCTAAAGTTCAAC-3′) and L-flaB-R1 (5′-TGAATTCGGTTTCATATTTGCC-3′) for species classification [ 26 ]. After an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 1 min, the reaction mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 10 s, annealing at 50°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 50 s. DNA sequencing of the amplicons was performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the PCR primers, and the resulting sequences were compared with those of reference strains through BLAST search ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ). The flaB sequences determined have been deposited in a public database (DDBJ accession numbers LC565816– LC565842). MLST was performed using seven housekeeping genes, glmU, pntA, sucA, tpiA, pfkB, mreA, and caiB, as previously described by Boonsilp et al. [ 27 ]. Sequence types (STs) were assigned through the MLST database ( https://pubmlst.org/leptospira/ ). New STs obtained in this study have been deposited in the database (ST308, ST313, ST314, ST316, ST317, and ST318). A minimum spanning tree (MST) based on the allelic profiles of MLST of the isolates was created using BioNumerics Software (version 7.6, Applied-Maths, Sint Maartens-Latem, Belgium) with categorical efficiency.  Serogroups of the isolates were identified by the MAT using a panel of anti-Leptospira rabbit sera for serogroups Australis (serovar Australis), Autumnalis (serovars Autumnalis and Rachmati), Ballum (serovar Castellonis), Bataviae (serovar Bataviae), Canicola (serovar Canicola), Cynopteri (serovar Cynopteri), Djasiman (serovar Djasiman), Grippotyphosa (serovar Grippotyphosa), Hebdomadis (serovar Hebdomadis), Icterohaemorrhagiae (serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae), Javanica (serovar Javanica), Mini (serovar Mini), Pomona (serovar Pomona), Pyrogenes (serovar Pyrogenes), Sarmin (serovar Sarmin), Sejroe (serovars Hardjo and Sejroe), and Tarassovi (serovar Tarassovi). Twenty-five microliters of 4- to 7-day-cultures of the isolates were incubated with the same volume of 200-fold diluted antisera for 2.5 hr at 30°C and the reaction was interpreted as positive when the proportion of free, unagglutinated leptospires was < 50% compared with the control suspension. When no positive reactions were observed, MAT was conducted using 50-fold diluted antisera. Each isolate except for serogroup Autumnalis strains (MRI-G12-13, P11-15, U9-17, and X5-18) reacted with a single antiserum and no cross reactions were observed. The serogroup Autumnalis strains reacted with anti-Autumnalis and Rachmati antisera.  For the survey of reservoir animals, we used live traps and captured 108 rodents and shrews in Kandy, Central Province in 2015 and 116 rodents in Giradurukotte, Uva Province in 2017. Animal dissections were performed according to the American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines under the ethical approval of the Institutional Review Board of the University of Peradeniya. The species of animals captured was identified by DNA sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, cytb [ 23 ]. DNA was extracted from animal kidney tissues using DNAZOL Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cytb was amplified with AmpliTaq Gold 360 Mater Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using primer pairs H15300 (5′-GTTTACAAGACCAGAGTAAT-3′) and L497A (5′-CCTAGTAGAATGAATCTGAGG-3′) and H655A (5′-TGTGTAGTATGGGTGGAATGG-3′) and L14115 (5′-GACATGAAAAATCATCGTTG-3′) [ 23 ] or L14274 (5′-CGAAGCTTGATATGAAAAACCATCGTTG-3′)and H15149 (5′-AAACTGCAGCCCCTCAGAATGATATTTGTCCTCA-3′) [ 24 ]. After an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 10 min, the reaction mixture was subjected to 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 50°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 60 s, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. DNA sequencing of the amplicons was performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the PCR primers and the resulting sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analyses as previously described [ 23 ]. All black rats captured in this study belonged to Rattus rattus complex lineage 1 [ 25 ]. For the isolation of Leptospira spp., kidney tissues were inoculated into 5 ml liquid EMJH medium that composed Difco Leptospira Medium Base EMJH and Difco Leptospira Enrichment EMJH (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and supplemented with 100 μg/mL of 5-fluorouracil and cultured at 30°C for 3 months.  We retrospectively analyzed 24 Leptospira strains stored at National Reference Laboratory for Leptospirosis, Medical Research Institute, Sri Lanka. These strains were isolated from clinically-suspected leptospirosis patients defined by the National Guideline on Management of Leptospirosis 2016, Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka ( www.epid.gov.lk ) between 2012 to January 2019 by bedside inoculation of two drops of fresh blood into liquid Ellinghausen–McCullough–Johnson–Harris (EMJH) medium that comprised Difco Leptospira Medium Base EMJH and Difco Leptospira Enrichment EMJH (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) with no antibiotics. During the period, 401 blood cultures were collected and 28 Leptospira strains were isolated (isolation rate: 7.0%), of which four cultures were contaminated and not included in this study. The isolates were stored in semisolid EMJH as described above at ambient temperature and inoculated into liquid medium before serological and molecular characterization and cultured at 30°C. This study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Medical Research Institute.  We captured 108 rodents and shrews (Rattus rattus, 102; Suncus murinus, 6) in Kandy, Central Province and 116 rodents (R. rattus, 112; Mus booduga, 2; Bandicota bengalensis, 1; unidentified Murinae species, 1) in Girandurukotte, Uva Province. Three L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica, two from Kandy (1.9%) and one from Girandurukotte (0.9%), were isolated by kidney tissue culture of R. rattus, and STs of two isolates in Kandy and an isolate in Girandurukotte were ST143 and ST144, respectively ( Table 1 and Fig 1 ).  Each circle represents an individual ST, and the color indicates the Leptospira serogroup. Circle size corresponds to the number of isolates in each ST. The digits on the lines between two circles represent the number of different alleles between two STs. One isolate of ST144 and two isolates of ST143 were isolated from rats, and others were isolated from human patients. ST308, ST313, ST314, ST316, ST317, and ST318 were newly assigned in this study.  MST indicated genetic diversity in the same serogroups ( Fig 2 and S1 – S3 Figs): for example, in L. interrogans serogroup Pyrogenes, ST74, ST75, and ST308 are of the same group (>5/7 alleles were identical), whereas ST30 and ST316 showed more than four allele differences ( Fig 2 ). Regarding novel STs identified in this study, ST318 is the same group with ST68 (5/7 loci) that was isolated from humans in Thailand ( S3 Fig ). ST313 is the same group with ST44 (5/7 loci) found in Sri Lanka, but their serogroups are different. On the other hand, there are no known STs that are the same group with STs 314, 316, and ST317, although ST314 and ST317 form the same group ( Fig 2 and S2 Fig ).  MLST using seven housekeeping genes revealed 14 STs among human isolates: ST144 (1 strain) in L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica; ST318 (2) in L. kirschneri serogroup Grippotyphosa; ST34 (1), ST44 (1), ST314 (1), and ST317 (1) in L. interrogans serogroup Autumnalis; ST80 (1) in L. interrogans serogroup Hebdomadis; ST30 (2), ST74 (1), ST75 (8), ST308 (2), and ST316 (1) in L. interrogans serogroup Pyrogenes; and ST43 (1) and ST313 (1) in L. interrogans unidentified segrogroup strains ( Table 1 ). Among the 14 STs, six STs, ST308, ST313, ST314, ST316, ST317, and ST318 were newly assigned in this study. Three new genotypes, ST308, ST313, and ST314, were isolated from severe patients ( S1 Table ) during the outbreak from 2015 to 2017 in Elpitiya, Southern Province [ 9 ].  By partial flaB gene sequencing and MAT using a panel of 19 antisera, species and serogoup of the isolates were identified as Leptospira interrogans serogroup Pyrogenes (14 strains), L. interrogans serogroup Autumnalis (4 strains), L. kirschneri serogroup Grippotyphosa (2 strains), L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica (1 strain), and L. interrogans serogroup Hebdomadis (1 strain) ( Table 1 ). Serogroups of two L. interrogans isolates could not be identified: one of the isolates reacted weakly with anti-serovar Rachmati antiserum at 1:100, and the other reacted with none of the 19 antisera.  A total of 24 Leptospira strains isolated from 401 clinically-suspected leptospirosis patients (positive rate including four contaminated cultures: isolation rate, 7.0%) were analyzed. The median (range) age of the culture-positive population was 39.5 (12–72) years, with 95.8% male predominance (n = 23). Majority (67%, n = 16) were from Western Province, and others were from Southern Province (n = 6), North-Western Province (n = 1) and Uva Province (n = 1) ( Fig 1 ). Among 21 cases with clinical information available (Western Province; 14, Southern Province; 6, North-Western Province; 1), severe symptoms were seen in eight cases, of which six were from the Elpitiya Medical Officer of Health region in Southern Province ( S1 Table ). All patients with severe disease survived.  Discussion  This study revealed that genetically diverse Leptospira strains currently cause human leptospirosis in Sri Lanka. MLST showed 15 STs among 27 isolates: 6 STs have been reported in Sri Lanka, 3 STs have been found in other countries: ST30 from a human in Australia (1951), ST34 from humans in Laos (2006 and 2008) and Thailand (2000–2006) and from bandicoot rats in Thailand (2004), and ST143 from humans in Laos (2007), Thailand (2002–2004), and Russia (2014) and rats from China (1988), Indonesia (1938), and Japan (2005, 2008 and 2010), and six STs were identified for the first time in this study [20 and the MLST database (https://pubmlst.org/leptospira/)]. Various Leptospira genotypes (STs) were found in the Western and Southern Provinces in this study (Table 1 and Fig 1). This finding is in contrast to the previous studies based on nucleotide sequences of a single gene (16S rRNA gene) that indicated that single genotype was predominant in certain regions [13, 16]. This discrepancy may be related to their restricted sampling areas and difference in discriminatory power of MLST and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis.  Leptospira interrogans serogroup Pyrogenes ST75 has been found only in Sri Lanka since 2006 [MLST database (https://pubmlst.org/leptospira/)] and six of the seven loci are identical between ST75 and ST308 (Fig 2 and S2 Fig), indicating that new ST308 emerged from ST75. However, the way of emergence of other new STs remains unclear (Fig 2 and S2 and S3 Figs). Although they may have existed in the country for some time, the importation of livestock or unintentional introduction of rodent reservoirs via merchant ships may be the reason for the emergence of new Leptospira genotypes. Recent whole genome sequencing study (WGS) suggested that L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni may have spread globally via reservoir rats, R. norvegicus [28]. L. interrogans ST34 found in this study was isolated from bandicoot rats (Bandicota indica and B. savilei) in Thailand [29], which may have been introduced to and then spread to the indigenous bandicoot rats in Sri Lanka, but more comprehensive analysis like WGS of Sri Lankan and Thai isolates of ST34 needs to verify this assumption.  In this study, we found that L. interrogans serogroup Pyrogenes ST75 is the dominant clone in Sri Lanka (8/24). This ST strain was isolated from four mild and three severe patients (and one patient without clinical records; S1 Table). In addition, its genetically related ST308 was also isolated from severe patients, suggesting that these clonal complex strains can potentially cause severe leptospirosis in humans. These results suggest that the expansion of these clonal complex strains may be related to recent frequent outbreaks of leptospirosis. Besides ST308, novel STs, ST313 and ST314 were also isolated from severe patients during the outbreak from 2015 to 2017 in Elpitiya, Southern Province [9] (S1 Table). The relationship between Leptospira genotypes and their virulence has been suggested: a specific clone belonging to L. interrogans serovars Copenhageni and Autumnalis has been shown to be associated with severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome in Brazil and outbreaks of leptospirosis in Thailand, respectively [29, 30]. Besides bacterial virulence, the association between serum levels of cytokines and clinical outcome in patients with leptospirosis has been demonstrated [31]. Although the number of patients infected with the clonal complex strains is limited and more cases are needed, comprehensive proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analysis of blood or immune cells in mild and severe patients infected with this L. interrogans serogroup Pyrogenes clonal complex would give insights into the pathogenesis and disease severity of leptospirosis.  Although the isolates were from different provinces, L. borgpetersenii ST144 was isolated both from a human patient and a black rat, indicating that the black rat is likely to be the infection source of this strain for humans. However, there is no information on reservoir animals for other STs. As mentioned above, bandicoot rats are likely to be reservoir animals for ST34. DNA of L. borgpetersenii, L. interrogans, and L. kirschneri has recently been detected in cattle, suggesting its importance as a reservoir animal in Sri Lanka [14, 19]. In addition, antibodies against serogroup Pyrogenes were detected in buffaloes and buffalo farmers in Homagama area, Western Province [32]. Six L. interrogans serogroup Pyrogenes ST30 (2) and ST75 (4) were isolated from patients in the Base Hospital Homagama, implying buffaloes as an important reservoir in Homagama and suburbs. L. interrogans DNA and DNA of unknown Leptospira species have also been detected in elephant and buffalo urine samples, respectively [33, 34]. Furthermore, Leptospira strains belonging to serogroups Autumnalis, Hebdomadis, and Grippotyphosa without species identification were isolated from Rattus sp, dogs, or Bandicota bengalensis (Gunomys gracilis) [21]. In this study, the isolation rate of Leptospira spp. from small mammals was less than that previously described: Leptospira spp. were isolated from 49 of 592 (8.3%) rodents of five species about 50 years ago [21]. Leptospira DNA was detected from 11% rodents by real-time PCR [34]. Low carriage rate in this study may be related to environmental differences in the areas and/or season investigated. L. interrogans was linked to humid habitats, whereas L. borgpetersenii was abundant in both humid and dry habitats [35]. A higher prevalence during the dry season than rainy season has been observed in some rodent species [36]. Further investigations on cattle and other animals as well as the importance of rodents as a reservoir animal are necessary to identify reservoir animals and the transmission route(s) of leptospirosis in Sri Lanka.  In summary, genetically diverse Leptospira strains, both known and novel genotypes, currently cause human leptospirosis in Sri Lanka. The number of reported cases of leptospirosis with new clinical entities has increased in recent times. Three new genotypes, ST308, ST313, and ST314, were isolated from severe patients during the outbreak from 2015 to 2017 in Elpitiya, Southern Province [9]. Further studies are required to verify the relationship between the emergence of new Leptospira genotypes and the recent surge of leptospirosis patients and frequent outbreaks of leptospirosis in Sri Lanka."

   BEIJING, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his recent speech at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, n… [+131717 chars]","Full Text: Pompeo's Fact-twisting China Speech Versus the Truth  BEIJING, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his recent speech at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, negated every aspect of China-U.S. relations, maliciously attacked the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and China's political system, and attempted to drive a wedge between the CPC and the Chinese people. He also wantonly criticized China's domestic and foreign policies, spread the so-called ""China threat"", and called for an anti-China alliance to contain China's development.  Pompeo's baseless, fact-distorting speech misrepresents history and the reality. It is full of ideological prejudice and driven by a Cold-War mentality. His remarks have not only been condemned by the Chinese people, but also criticized and opposed by sensible people in the United States as well as the international community.  To debunk the lies fabricated by Pompeo, let the facts speak for themselves.  1. Mike Pompeo: The Chinese people are completely distinct from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The biggest lie that they tell is to think that they speak for 1.4 billion people. The CCP fears the Chinese people's honest opinions more than any foe.  False.  Fact check: The Communist Party of China (CPC) does not have any special interest of its own. It takes seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation as its original aspiration and founding mission. It represents the fundamental interests of the greatest possible majority of the Chinese people and remains dedicated to wholeheartedly serving the people. The CPC believes that all is by the people and for the people. It puts the people's interests first, with safeguarding the people's interests as the starting point and ultimate goal of all of its work. Under the leadership of the CPC, the Chinese people have won independence, freedom and liberation, and continued to make great achievements in the process of national construction and development.  -- The CPC comes from the people and is rooted in the people. The CPC's position of leadership is the choice of history and the people. Since its founding 99 years ago, the CPC has grown from a small party with just more than 50 members to a large party with nearly 100 million members. The CPC is deeply rooted in the Chinese people and closely linked to them, and has maintained its great vitality. By the end of 2019, the CPC had 91.914 million members and 18.992 million applicants for Party membership. It is the world's largest party that governs the world's most populous country on a long-term basis. No one can turn a blind eye to the fact that the CPC is supported by the Chinese people. James Palmer, senior editor with the U.S. magazine Foreign Policy, noted that the CPC is deeply woven into the fabric of ordinary Chinese life. It is a common belief that ""without the party, there would be no new China"" and trust in the CPC is the mainstream public opinion in China.  -- Kishore Mahbubani, a professor at the National University of Singapore and former Singaporean ambassador to the United Nations, wrote, in an article carried by The National Interest, that while Pompeo claimed that the Chinese people are completely distinct from the CPC, the fact is that each year a large number of Chinese apply to join the CPC and only a small number of them get in, making it as difficult to join the CPC as it is to get into leading universities in America. The CPC is not a party about to crack up under American pressure as it is floating on an ocean of legitimacy among 1.4 billion Chinese people.  -- The CPC upholds a thinking of development that puts the people in the center. Under the leadership of the CPC, China has seen its per capita GDP increase from less than 120 yuan in the early 1950s to more than 70,000 yuan today, the basic needs of nearly 1.4 billion people well met, impoverished population drop by 850 million, employment provided for 770 million people, and basic support extended to the 250 million elderly people, 85 million people with disabilities and more than 60 million urban and rural people living on subsistence allowance. China, with a population of nearly 1.4 billion, has made a historic leap forward from poverty, to a life of subsistence and to one of moderate prosperity. China has put in place the world's largest systems for education, social security, health care and democratic elections at the primary level.  -- Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the CPC and the Chinese government have put the people and their lives front and center, saving lives at all costs and protecting people's health and safety. Everything possible has been done to treat every patient, whether he or she is 108 years old or a new-born baby. China has scored major strategic achievements in bringing the virus under control. China's economic growth shifted from negative to positive territory in the second quarter this year, up 3.2 percent. China's economy is seeing the resumption of growth and steady recovery. Experts from the Institute of International Finance, UBS and other well-known international institutions, as well as media outlets, have expressed optimism about China's economic prospects.  -- At the height of the COVID-19 epidemic when the people's lives and safety were in grave danger, upon a call for action from the CPC Central Committee, Party members and officials came to the fore. More than 4.6 million primary-level Party organizations operated in full gear. From racing against the clock to save more lives in intensive care units to visiting urban and rural communities for possible infections, from working overtime for production of supplies in factory workshops to pursuing a breakthrough in virus research at laboratories, more than 39 million Party members had been working day and night at the front-line to fight the epidemic. In this process, nearly 400 Party members laid down their lives, as they, together with other CPC members, faced danger squarely. The Party flag has always flown high at the front line. All of these speak to the fact that CPC organizations at all levels have acted as strong bastions against the virus and Party members and officials have played an exemplary role. They are the mainstay of the country in this fight.  -- In August 2018, Ipsos, a well-known market research company in the world, released a report titled What Worries the World. It found that China led the world in national optimism as 91 percent of its people believe that their country is going on the right track. China claimed the top spot in 28 countries surveyed, leaving the United States far behind in the ranking.  -- In May 2020, Edelman, a renowned communications firm headquartered in the United States, updated its report of Trust Barometer. It revealed that the Chinese people have 95 percent trust in their government, making the country the top of the countries surveyed, whereas the United States was placed next to last, in the territory of distrust.  -- In July 2020, the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard Kennedy School made public a survey titled Understanding CCP Resilience: Surveying Chinese Public Opinion Through Time. It found that Chinese citizen satisfaction with government has increased virtually across the board since 2003, and people in poorer, inland regions are actually comparatively more likely to report increases in satisfaction. Breakdown data also showed a near-universal upturn in the people's satisfaction toward all four levels of government from 2003 to 2016, with approval ratings running as high as 93.1 percent.  -- The China Data Lab in the University of California, San Diego, recently released an article, saying that the Chinese public's trust in and support of their government have grown from strength to strength. They have significantly rallied since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic. According to this survey, as of May 2020, the average level of trust in the central government has jumped to 8.87 on a scale of one to 10, and 83 percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed to the statement that they prefer living under China's political system as compared to others.  -- Unlike what the CPC has done for the people in coping with COVID-19, politicians in the United States held on to the primacy of personal political gains and ""capital first"". To this end, they played down the epidemic, ignored science, and even resorted to blame game. The result is a major outbreak that has taken a heavy toll on Americans' lives and health. According to media tallies in May, more than one third of coronavirus deaths in America's 31 states came from nursing homes.  By Aug. 24, the United States had recorded a cumulative total of 5.69 million confirmed cases, more than 63 times of that in China. More than 170,000 people had died, equivalent to about 540 deaths per million, which were 37 times and 160 times the corresponding numbers in China. With a population of four percent of the world's total, the United States made up 24 percent of global infections and 22 percent of global deaths.  The public's anxiety has continued to climb up. Some 81 percent of Americans in a recent poll reported feeling ""very concerned"" or ""somewhat concerned"" about the virus. A latest NPR/Ipsos poll released on Aug. 4 found that two thirds of respondents said they believe the United States is handling the epidemic worse than other countries. Among them, 41 percent contended that the country's performance is ""much worse"" than that of other countries, while 25 percent rated the performance as being ""somewhat worse.""  Americans have come to a pretty dire place in the combat, said a pollster with Ipsos, and they are looking for sweeping, really broad, powerful action. The U.S. economy has suffered a heavy blow as its GDP contracted at an annualized rate of 32.9 percent in the second quarter, the deepest drop in output since record began in 1947. Fitch, one of the three major credit rating agencies in the world, revised its outlook on the country's sovereign rating from ""stable"" to ""negative.""  2. Mike Pompeo: China is not a free country, as 1.4 billion Chinese are surveilled and oppressed. China is repeating some of the same mistakes that the Soviet Union made - rejecting property rights and predictable rule of law.  False.  Fact check: China practices socialism with Chinese characteristics. An essential feature of the socialist democracy is that the people are the masters of the country. The socialist political system with Chinese characteristics upholds the unity of Party leadership, the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance, and features enhancing institutional safeguards for the running of the country by the people.  -- China achieved freedom from the oppression of imperialism and colonialism. Freedom, democracy and rule of law are codified in China's Constitution. They are also part of the core values of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In 1997, the 15th CPC National Congress committed to ""...ensuring that the people enjoy extensive rights and freedom endowed by law, and respecting and guaranteeing human rights."" In 2007, respecting and guaranteeing of human rights was added into the CPC Constitution for the first time. In 2017, the 19th CPC National Congress established Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guiding thinking of the CPC, and categorically stated that the CPC should ""strengthen legal protection for human rights to ensure that the people enjoy extensive rights and freedoms as prescribed by law,"" and stressed protecting people's personal rights, property rights, and right to dignity. The Chinese government earnestly respects and fully protects the human rights and freedoms of Chinese citizens in accordance with China's Constitution and other laws.  -- On May 28, 2020, the third session of the 13th National People's Congress adopted the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China, representing an important milestone in the country's advancement of socialist rule of law in the new era. With seven parts, 1,260 articles and more than 100,000 words, the civil code was compiled based on systematically incorporating and modifying existing civil laws and regulations formulated in different periods, including the general principles of the civil law and laws on real rights, contract, guarantee, marriage, adoption, inheritance, tort liability and personality rights. It adjusts personal and property relations between natural persons, legal persons and other civil subjects, and provides equal protection of rights in various areas including safeguarding life and health, property safety, convenient transactions, people's happiness and dignity.  -- China safeguards freedom of religious belief in accordance with the law. The country has nearly 200 million religious believers, more than 380,000 clerical personnel, and about 140,000 places of worship registered for religious activities. The scriptures of Islam, Buddhism and Christianity among other religions have been translated, published and distributed in multiple languages. In Tibet Autonomous Region, there are 1,787 religious venues which house more than 46,000 Buddhist monks and nuns. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has 24,800 religious venues including mosques, churches, temples and Taoist abbeys; there is one mosque for 530 Muslims on average in the region; the number of clerical personnel is 29,300; students have access to undergraduate programs in Islamic institutes; and more than 1.76 million copies of the Quran and Selections from Sahih of al-Buhari have been distributed.  -- Liberty does not mean a free rein, and science, reason, law, order and international rules are all foundations of liberty. Liberty, says Montesquieu in ""The Spirit of the Laws,"" is a right of doing whatever the laws permit, and if a citizen could do what they forbid, he would be no longer possessed of liberty. Freedom has boundaries. Even the so-called ""free nations"" delimit a ""no-go zone"" for liberty and never allow anyone to challenge the bottom line of the legal system. The Chinese government has the power conferred by the law to take various measures to safeguard national unity, ethnic solidarity and social stability. It is also duty-bound to protect the lawful rights and interests of the vast majority of the people by taking these measures. The exercise of its power and the fulfillment of its duties fall within China's domestic affairs and no interference from external forces will be tolerated.  -- The constitutions of more than 100 countries provide that the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms should not jeopardize national security. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights stipulates that the freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs, the right to freedom of expression, the right of peaceful assembly, and the right to a public trial among other rights may be subject to limitations that are necessary to protect public safety or order. The European Convention on Human Rights also has similar provisions. The United States, Britain, Canada and Australia among other countries have built strict legal systems to safeguard national security and stay tough on fighting crimes endangering national security.  3.Mike Pompeo: The United States is a beacon of freedom for people all around the world, including people inside of China.  False.  Fact check: The United States proclaims itself as a ""beacon of freedom,"" which is no more than an illusion that deceives both its people and the world. According to a survey conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 80 percent of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction, an all-time high in AP-NORC surveys. According to a poll published by the Pew Research Center on July 1, only 12 percent of Americans say they are satisfied with the way things are going in the country, while 87 percent say they are dissatisfied, and most Americans are dissatisfied with how the government operates. According to a Gallup poll, American pride has reached the lowest point in two decades, with only 20 percent of Americans satisfied with the way things are going in their country. Extreme pride among whites has fallen below 50 percent for the first time and non-whites 24 percent.  -- The United States is highly unpopular around the globe, as only one third of people across the world acknowledge the United States' leading position. A survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations shows that people from multiple countries are losing their trust in the United States. Researchers conducted the survey among 11,000 people from nine European countries, and over two thirds of respondents from Germany, France, Spain and Denmark said that their views of the United States have worsened. The country's reputation dropped particularly drastically in France and Germany, as 46 percent of French respondents and 42 percent of German respondents said the United States' image has ""severely worsened"" due to COVID-19. The 2020 Best Countries report also showed that the world's trust in the United States has dropped by more than 50 percent since 2016, the sharpest drop of any country assessed in the report.  -- An annual survey report published by Gallup on July 27 showed that ""U.S. leadership remains unpopular worldwide."" The ""free world"" proclaimed by the United States, in particular, disapproves U.S. leadership. The approval of U.S. leadership is at its lowest among the country's traditional allies in Europe, where 61 percent of respondents disapprove of its performance, and only 24 percent approve of it. In the United Kingdom, the figure is 65 percent disapprove, with a similar outcome in France. In Germany, the U.S. stature is even worse, as 78 percent disapprove the leadership coming from Washington. In Australia, whose government follows closely its U.S. counterpart, there is deep skepticism about the United States as well, with 67 percent disapproving its performance.  -- Tara D. Sonenshine, former U.S. undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs and currently a fellow in public diplomacy at the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs, recently said that the United States is losing its global leadership, with its international reputation hitting the bottom and its allies giving up on it. Over the past few years, many of the key policies put forward by the United States are broadly unpopular around the globe, especially the ""America-first"" principle which provoked discontent among many of its allies. According to a new Pew Research Center survey spanning 37 nations, just 20 percent of the respondents has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs.  -- U.S. citizens' personal dignity and privacy suffer systematic violation. The Dallas Morning News reported last December that Texas is home to eight secretive surveillance centers, supported jointly by federal, state and local law enforcement departments, which share information and monitor social media and other online forums for potential threats. A report of the U.S. Government Accountability Office released in June 2019 said that the FBI's Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation Services Unit may search at its will in the database of over 641 million face photos without any legal permission.  -- The United States lacks sufficient protection of ethnic minorities' human rights and fundamental freedoms. Ethnic minorities in the country suffer bullying and exclusion, facing long-term, widespread and systematic discrimination in the political, economic, cultural and social areas. For American Indians alone, the U.S. government, for a long time, implemented compulsory policies of ethnic extinction, isolation and assimilation against them.  In nearly 100 years after the United States of America was founded, the country drove out and killed American Indians on a large scale during the Westward Movement. By the beginning of the 20th century, the number of American Indians within the border of the United States dropped sharply to 250,000 from five million in 1492. Currently, American Indians only account for two percent of the country's total population.  Since the COVID-19 outbreak, African Americans are over four times more likely to catch the disease than white Americans, with much higher mortality rates as well, highlighting racial inequality in the country. Fatal police shootings are not uncommon either, with the number of such cases reaching 1,004 in 2019 alone. Among the 7,036 bias-induced hate crime cases reported by U.S. law enforcement agencies in 2018, 57.5 percent were motivated by a race, ethnicity or ancestry bias. Furthermore, of hate crimes motivated by race, ethnicity or ancestry, 46.9 percent were against African Americans. African Americans accounted for 47.1 percent of the 5,155 victims of race-based hate crimes. On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, an African American man in the state of Minnesota, was killed by a white police officer, triggering large-scale protests across the United States. The United Nations Human Rights Council held an urgent debate and adopted a resolution, strongly condemning the incident and calling for the United States to take concrete measures to protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of African Americans.  -- The United States has the widest wealth gap among Western countries. In January 2017, the Business Insider published a chart by Torsten Slok, Deutsche Bank's chief international economist, which showed the share of U.S. household wealth by income level. Notably, the top 0.1 percent of households hold about the same amount of wealth as the bottom 90 percent. From 1989 to 2018, the bottom 50 percent of families saw basically no net increase in their wealth. In light of COVID-19, employers in the United States have laid off tens of millions of employees since this February, dealing a particularly heavy blow to low-income workers and dragging the employment rate 35 percent lower than the pre-COVID-19 level.  -- The United States suppresses the media and restricts freedom of the press. The Washington Post reported in April 2019 that for the third time in three years, the United States' standing in an annual index of press freedom declined. In 2019, 38 journalists in the country suffered attacks; journalists were rejected from attending government open events for 28 times; and nine journalists were arrested or faced criminal charges. Media organizations including The New York Times and The Hill in the United States and The Guardian in the United Kingdom frequently reported news of journalists being attacked or arrested while reporting the protests concerning George Floyd, with 148 journalists involved from May 26 to June 2 alone -- 40 journalists were shot by gun; 34 physically assaulted by police; 33 arrested or detained; and one female photojournalist even permanently lost vision in her left eye after being shot by a rubber bullet. A report by The Guardian in December last year said the current U.S. administration ""has dealt the most sustained assault on press freedom in U.S. history.""  -- Abusing the concept of national security, the U.S. administration uses national resources to smear, attack, encircle and contain Chinese private companies including Huawei, ByteDance and Tencent, forbid U.S. service providers from purchasing equipment made by Huawei and ZTE, and ban Chinese social media applications such as TikTok and WeChat. The acts violate market principles of fair and free competition. This is sheer daylight robbery. How can such a country serve as the beacon for the Chinese people?  -- On July 25, The Atlantic published an article titled ""Pompeo's surreal speech on China"" by Thomas Wright, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He pointed out that Pompeo said the United States will organize the ""free world"" while alienating and undermining the ""free world."" Pompeo extolled democracy while aiding and abetting its destruction at home in the United States. Pompeo praised the Chinese people while generalizing about the ill intent of Chinese students who want to come to America. Pompeo's tirade will discredit the case for competition with China among U.S. allies, in Asia and Europe, who are petrified of a full-blown Cold War between the United States and China, Wright said.  4.Mike Pompeo: China seeks global hegemony. China threatens international agreements and treats international agreements as conduits for global dominance.  False.  Fact check: The Constitution of the Communist Party of China and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China (PRC) have made it clear that China follows a path of peaceful development and opposes hegemony. No matter what stage of development it reaches, China will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion. That's what China says, and also what it does. Since its founding 70 years ago, the PRC has never started any war or occupied an inch of the land of others. In contrast, the United States has never made such policy announcement. In a speech delivered by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 2019, he pointed out that the United States had only enjoyed 16 years of peace in its history of more than 240 years, making the country ""the most warlike nation in the history of the world.""  -- China firmly upholds the international system with the United Nations at its core and an international order based on international law, including a series of international conventions signed within the UN framework. China actively advocates a new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation, develops all-round friendship and cooperation with other countries, and establishes a global network of partnerships. China is committed to building a community with a shared future for mankind. It advocates an international order that features fairness and justice and calls for global cooperation through extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits and for upholding justice while pursuing shared interests. It has all along worked to safeguard the norms governing international relations, the multilateral system and stability of the international order. According to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, China has become an important pillar of the multilateral system, with the aim to establish a community with a shared future for mankind through practicing multilateralism.  -- As the first founding member to sign the UN Charter, China firmly upholds its purposes and principles and honors the spirit of contract and the international rule of law. China has all along kept its promises, followed rules and fulfilled agreements. China opposes acts that undermine the authority and sanctity of international law, including unauthorized use of force and withdrawal from treaties and organizations. China is also the second-largest contributor to the UN regular budget and peacekeeping operations, actively fulfilling its financial obligations to the UN as a developing country.  -- China has signed or joined 20 multilateral arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It also actively participates in the international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation process, opposes arms race, and safeguards global strategic balance and stability. China has also voluntarily downsized its military personnel by over 4 million since reform and opening up.  -- China has fully fulfilled its obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, and made efforts to build a global climate governance system that is fair, equitable, and mutually beneficial. Compared with 2005, China's carbon dioxide emissions dropped by 45.8 percent in 2018, achieving emission reduction target set for 2020 two years ahead of schedule, and non-fossil energy accounted for 14.3 percent of China's total energy consumption. China leads the world in the investment, installed capacity, power generation and consumption of renewable energy, and has more than half of the world's new energy vehicles. Since 2000, China has contributed to a quarter of the world's newly increased afforestation areas.  -- The United States always seeks selfish gains under the pretext of upholding international law. Its all-time principle is to apply international law in a selective way. The United States has withdrawn from more than 10 international treaties and organizations, severely undermining international fairness and justice, as well as peace, stability and development in the world.  In 1982, the United States, to maintain its maritime hegemony, refused to sign the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which it is still not a party.  In 1985, the United States refused to recognize the compulsory jurisdiction of the UN International Court of Justice (ICJ) after Nicaragua complained that U.S. armed intervention violated its sovereignty.  In 1995, the United States announced its withdrawal from the UN Industrial Development Organization and refused to pay arrears by claiming domestic budgetary constraints.  In 2001, the United States refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, saying that it was not in its national interest to meet relevant environmental obligations. It is still not a party to the protocol.  In 2001, the United States announced its withdrawal from the UN World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance after failing to prevent discussion of Israeli military action against Palestinians.  In 2002, the United States formally withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972, aiming to develop its anti-ballistic missile systems.  In 2002, the United States announced its withdrawal from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, citing unfavorable terms for American soldiers, diplomats and politicians.  In 2017, the United States announced its withdrawal from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) due to ""concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO.""  In 2017, the United States announced its formal withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership because it believed that the multilateral trade agreements were not in its best interests and hindered its ""America First"" policy.  In 2017, the U.S. government announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, believing that it hindered the U.S. economic development and calling global climate change a ""created concept.""  In 2017, the United States announced that it has decided to end participation in the UN process to develop a Global Compact on Migration, saying that ""our decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone.""  In 2018, despite the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Iran's fulfillment of its Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) commitment and that the United States had no clear evidence to show Iran's breach of the deal, the United States announced its withdrawal from the JCPOA, a deal that has been endorsed by the UN Security Council, imposed unilateral sanctions against Iran, and prevented other countries from implementing the deal through ""long-arm jurisdiction.""  In 2018, the United States announced its withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council, claiming it failed to effectively protect human rights.  In 2018, the United States announced its withdrawal from the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes relating to the jurisdiction of the ICJ in response to Palestine's complaint to the ICJ over the U.S. government's relocation of its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem.  In 2019, the United States announced its withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty to develop advanced capabilities without restraint.  In 2020, the United States announced steps to exit the Open Skies Treaty despite the opposition from its allies, saying the steps would start on May 22 and would be finished six months later.  In 2020, U.S. national security agencies discussed the possibility of resuming nuclear tests, which has met with wide criticism from the international community, causing concerns that the possible resumption would violate the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, provoke a nuclear arms race, and further undermine global strategic stability and security.  In 2020, the U.S. government, looking for scapegoats for its botched response to COVID-19, announced its withdrawal from the World Health Organization. It should be noted that the United States still owes more than 200 million U.S. dollars in assessed contributions, which should be paid off before the exit takes effect.  -- For some time, the U.S. government has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from a series of international organizations and treaties, including the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and even the UN. Turning wantonly away from international organizations and treaties is against the spirit of contract and international justice. The rules must be observed in fairness and be mutually binding, and must not be compromised by ""pragmatism"" and ""double standards.""  -- According to a Pew Research Center survey in February 2019, 45 percent of the surveyed believe the United States poses a grave threat to the world. There are 10 nations surveyed where roughly half or more now see U.S. power as a major threat, including Germany, Japan and South Korea. Recently some U.S. media, experts and scholars publicly said that the country posing the biggest geopolitical threat to the United States is precisely the United States itself.  5. Mike Pompeo: The CCP will subvert the rules-based order that the free world have worked hard to build. The CCP's actions are the primary challenge today in the free world. The free world must triumph over this new tyranny. It's time for a new alliance of democracies. The division is between freedom and tyranny, not about siding with America or China.  False.  Fact check: To arbitrarily label a country as ""free"" or ""tyrannical"" is a kind of groundless and preposterous arrogance and prejudice. The obsolete prejudices in the last century will not help solve the new problems in the 21st century. The call of our world today is peace and development and all countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are entitled to choose their own social system and development path. Preserving world peace and stability and achieving mutually-beneficial cooperation ought to be a common choice of the people of all countries around the world. To foment ideological confrontation is to intentionally lead the world into a new Cold War, and is a resurgence of the notorious McCarthyism that is going against the trend of the times.  -- Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his recent article published in Foreign Affairs magazine expressed concern of Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries over the tensions between the United States and China, saying that Asia-Pacific countries do not wish to be forced to choose between the two. He said regional arrangements should be open and inclusive. ""They should not, whether by design or result, keep any party out, undermine existing cooperation arrangements, create rival blocs, or force countries to take sides...It is natural for big powers to compete. But it is their capacity for cooperation that is the true test of statecraft,"" he said.  -- Kishore Mahbubani, a professor at the National University of Singapore and a former Singaporean permanent representative to the United Nations, noted that China regained its strength by plugging into the rules-based global order established in 1945. He said China has no desire to overturn this order, and it would be happy to cooperate with America within it. ""In short, a prosperous China can live together in peace with a prosperous America, as inconceivable as this thought might seem in the toxic political environment in the U.S.""  -- On July 25, an online international meeting themed ""No to the New Cold War,"" organized by scholars and activists from multiple countries, was streamed live on several platforms. One of the initiators, British scholar John Ross said the theme was not about a ""pro-China"" statement, but was because the U.S.-led new Cold War will be against the interests of humanity and is a threat to humanity. He said the new Cold War is an attempt by the present U.S. administration to impose its policies on the world and force other countries to follow.  -- The U.S. administration has withdrawn from many international treaties and organizations and wantonly wields the big stick of sanctions, disregarding international obligations and norms. It has become the biggest destroyer of international order and the world's top source of instability. Many Western strategists have pointed out that it is absurd that the United States considers itself a representative of the ""free world."" By resorting to ideological tactics to build a coalition to contain China, the United States puts itself on the wrong side of history.  -- The United States has instigated multiple coups in other countries under the pretext of ""freedom"" that resulted in military governments coming to power, and provoked chaos through ""color revolutions."" Lindsey O'Rourke, an associate professor of Boston College's political science department, observed in her book ""Covert Regime Change: America's Secret Cold War"" that the United States carried out 64 regime-change operations in other countries between 1947 and 1989. The Manila Times reported in September 2019 that the United States had, in the last decade alone, invaded and managed regime change in over 20 countries around the world. Even today, people in countries including Libya and Syria are still suffering from turmoil caused by wars, with freedom from fear and scarcity nowhere in sight. The international community has seen it increasingly clear the real purpose of the United States' trumpeting for ""freedom"".  -- In an article by Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard University, which was titled ""How to Ruin a Superpower"" and published on Foreign Policy website on July 23, he pointed out the mistakes the United States committed, one of which was adopting a grand strategy of liberal hegemony in the uni-polar era, which sought to spread democracy, markets, and other liberal values far and wide and to bring the whole world into a ""liberal order"" that was designed and led by the United States.  -- Zheng Yongnian, a professor with the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, said in an article published in Lianhe Zaobao that an oversimplified classification of a country's political system as ""democracy"" or ""autocracy/a system concentrating nationwide effort and resources on key national undertakings"" will inevitably lead to politicization and ideologicalization, resulting in a double standard that prevents one from seeing the truth. The United States and Western ""democracies"" have always assumed a posture of being ready to wage a war against China for defending democracy, as if threats to Western democracy come from China. This is, in fact, utterly wrong. The threats to Western democracy only come from within, not from external challenges.  -- On July 25, experts and scholars from 48 countries held a meeting and issued a joint statement, pointing out that the words and deeds of the U.S. government against China are becoming increasingly fierce, which poses a threat to world peace, and that a new Cold War in any form is completely against the interests of humanity. The attendees supported China and the United States developing relations on the basis of dialogue and jointly working for solidarity of mankind.  6. Mike Pompeo: President Richard Nixon said ""the world cannot be safe until China changes."" The engagement the U.S. has been pursuing has not brought the kind of change inside of China that President Nixon had hoped to induce. The old paradigm of blind engagement with China has failed. The U.S. must induce China to change.  False.  Fact check: The U.S. engagement with China is deliberate rather than blind, and serves the national interests of the United States. President Nixon promoted the normalization of China-U.S. relations not to change China, but for the common interests of both countries. During his first visit to China in 1972, Nixon told Chinese leaders that he had come for U.S. interests. In a toast at the Great Hall of the People, Nixon said ""We began our talks recognizing that we have great differences, but we are determined that those differences not prevent us from living together in peace. You believe deeply in your system, and we believe just as deeply in our system.""  -- The assertion that the policy of engagement with China pursued by successive U.S. administrations has failed is just a rehash of the Cold War mentality. It turns a blind eye to all that has been achieved in China-U.S. relations over the past decades, and shows ignorance of the historical process and lack of respect for the Chinese and American peoples. This is a political virus which is understandably questioned and rebuked by people in the United States and the international community.  -- As two major countries of the world, China and the United States have coexisted peacefully over the past 40 years and more. There have been no wars or sharp confrontations. Instead, both countries have overcome difficulties and kept developing. This is the greatest achievement of the engagement policy. China-U.S. relations are of vital importance to the well-being of the two peoples and to world peace, stability and prosperity.  -- Pompeo's assertion ran contrary to historical facts, said former U.S. senior diplomat Charles Freeman, who joined Nixon's visit to China in 1972 as an interpreter. ""Those who don't understand what engagement achieved argue that it failed to change the Chinese political system, something it was never intended to do,"" he said.  -- Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said that Pompeo sought to commit the United States to a path that is bound to fail. It is not within America's power to determine China's future, much less transform it. How China addresses its challenges ""will be for the Chinese people and their leaders to determine,"" Haass noted.  -- Paul Heer, an expert from the Center for the National Interest, a U.S. think tank, pointed out that the 50 years of engagement with China, which Pompeo denounced as a failure, actually worked. Success in the Cold War against the Soviet Union, which was aided in part by China's decision to align strategically with the United States; China's reform and opening-up policy which greatly expanded U.S.-China economic and cultural relations; decades of an endless supply of inexpensive imports and an export market for American farmers and manufacturers; a gradual Chinese embrace of multilateralism and more responsible proliferation behavior; and a dramatic opening up of Chinese society compared to what it had been.  -- Kishore Mahbubani, a professor at the National University of Singapore and a former Singaporean ambassador to the United Nations, said that when future historians look back, they'll be puzzled by the Western expectation that a country like China, with 4,000 years of political history, could be changed by a country like the U.S., with a history of fewer than 250 years. The assumption that the rest of the world will, over time, become just like the West is arrogant.  There is a fundamental difference between the United States and China, said Mahbubani, noting that the United States believes that it has the best society in the world and any other countries can be better off by copying it. However, the world has seen in the past few years how difficult it is to transform a society. When the United States exported democracy to Iraq, it ended in disaster.  Mahbubani said Chinese people have a different position, which is simply that only we Chinese can be Chinese; you choose the system that is good for you, and we choose our own. The reality is that China is now getting stronger and certainly also becoming more capable of execution.  7. Mike Pompeo: America can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between the U.S. and China, just as the CCP has never ignored them. The U.S. must induce China to change in more creative and assertive ways.  False.  Fact check: Every country takes its development path on the basis of its cultural and historic traditions. No force is entitled to negate the choice of other countries. No country will alter its own system just because others do not like it. China has repeatedly stated that it never intends to challenge or replace the United States, or have a full confrontation with it. China has no intention to engage in rivalry of systems and ideological confrontation with the United States. China never exports ideology, never interferes in other countries' internal affairs, and never seeks to change the U.S. system. However, the incumbent U.S. administration is afraid to make such an aboveboard declaration as China does.  -- China and the United States differ from each other in history, culture, social systems, development paths and national conditions. Therefore, it is inevitable for the two countries to have some differences and frictions. What is important is for the two sides to correctly understand and properly handle such differences. Early on after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the United States pursued a containment policy toward China. The two countries even fought each other on the Korean Peninsula and then fell into 22 years of confrontation. In the 1970s, Dr. Henry Kissinger secretly visited China and then the two countries resumed exchange and opened the gate for peaceful coexistence and common prosperity under the efforts of former U.S. President Richard Nixon, Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. Ups and downs over the past few decades fully show that confrontation and conflict are not in the interests of China or the United States and dialogue and cooperation are the right way of getting along with each other. For the sake of our two countries and the world at large, China and the United States should not seek to remodel each other. Instead, they must work together to find ways to peaceful coexistence of different systems and civilizations.  -- When China-U.S. relations were normalized in 1972, the most fundamental reason for the realization of the cross-Pacific Ocean handshaking between leaders of the two countries was that both sides upheld the principle of mutual respect and seeking common ground while shelving differences, including our ideological differences.  -- As the Joint Communique of the People's Republic of China and the United States of America (Shanghai Communique) issued on Feb. 28, 1972 states, there are essential differences between China and the United States in their social systems and foreign policies. However, the two sides agreed that countries, regardless of their social systems, should conduct their relations on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The communique explicitly acknowledges that there are essential differences between the social systems of China and the United States, but the differences have not affected the establishment and development of China-U.S. relations.  -- According to the Joint Communique of the People's Republic of China and the United States of America (August 17 Communique) signed on Aug. 17, 1982, respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs constitute the fundamental principles guiding China-United States relations. The United States government attaches great importance to its relations with China, and reiterates that it has no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China's internal affairs, reads the communique. It adds that the development of China-United States relations is not only in the interests of the two peoples but also conducive to peace and stability in the world.  -- On Nov. 17, 2009, China and the United States signed a joint statement, stressing that each country and its people have the right to choose their own path, and all countries should respect each other's choice of a development model. The United States reiterated that it welcomes a strong, prosperous and successful China that plays a greater role in world affairs.  -- In a joint statement by the two countries, which was signed in Washington on Jan. 19, 2011, China and the United States underscored that each country and its people have the right to choose their own path, and all countries should respect each other's choice of a development model.  -- U.S. President Donald Trump paid a state visit to China from Nov. 8 to 10, 2017. The two sides agreed to expand cooperation in a wide range of areas on the basis of mutual benefit, properly manage differences on the basis of mutual respect, enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples and strengthen communication and coordination on major international and regional issues so as to move forward the China-U.S. ties.  -- What has happened in China-U.S. relations over the past generations demonstrates that this monumental choice made by the two sides is the right one. Over the past 40 years and more since the two countries entered into diplomatic ties, several generations of Chinese and Americans have worked together to advance China-U.S. relations. As a result, bilateral ties have become one of the most deeply interwoven relationships in the world with broadest cooperation areas and most extensive common interests. The ups and downs in China-U.S. relations provide ample evidence that confrontation and conflict are not in the fundamental interests of both sides, and dialogue and cooperation are the only way to go.  8. Mike Pompeo: The United States must distrust and verify when it comes to the CCP.  False.  Fact check: Pompeo's so-called ""distrust and verify"" approach to China abounds with strong Cold War mentality, ideological bias, condescending and bullying attitudes, as well as ignorance towards China. Indeed, there is a trust deficit between China and the United States. Its root lies in the Cold War mentality, ideological bias, and zero-sum game mindset of certain U.S. politicians, who have misread, misjudged or even deliberately distorted China's strategic intention and its internal and external policies.  -- Engagement between countries should be built on a foundation of integrity, a premise of equal treatment and a goal of peace, development and win-win cooperation. Bilateral relations should work in reciprocal ways: one country cannot have the other be responsible without taking its own responsibility for the other side. Likewise, one country cannot be concerned only with its own benefits and security without considering those of the other. If the United States assumes China to be a ""potential enemy"", eventually it is bound to ""create an enemy"". Only by regarding each other as partners can China and the United States avoid confrontation and become friends.  -- China has maintained a highly stable and consistent policy toward the United States, and China stands ready to develop a China-U.S. relationship featuring no conflict and confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation based on coordination, cooperation and stability. This will require the two sides to work in the same direction, respect international law and rules, and engage in equal dialogue and consultation.  -- While the United States unscrupulously contains and smears China around the world, and meddles in China's domestic affairs, it should not demand unrealistically that China show understanding and support to the United States in bilateral and global affairs. As an independent sovereign country, China has every right to uphold its sovereignty, security and development interests, safeguard the achievements that the Chinese people have made through hard work, and reject any bullying and injustice imposed on it.  -- The U.S. government has continuously pulled out of international treaties and organizations. It wields the stick of sanctions wherever it wants and ignores its international obligations and the international norms, making itself the most damaging force of the current international order and the biggest source of global instability. The current U.S. administration has pulled out of more international treaties than any one before it. It is the United States, not others, that deserves the ""distrust and verify"" approach the most.  9. Mike Pompeo: The CCP fails in its promises to the world, leading to the continued rise in the pandemic's death toll.  False.  Fact check: The Chinese government has taken the most comprehensive, strict and thorough prevention and control measures in the shortest time, containing the epidemic mainly in Wuhan. Data showed that very few cases were from China, and the transmission chain of the virus was effectively cut off. A Science magazine report estimated that the aforementioned measures reduced the number of infected people in China by more than 700,000.  -- When Wuhan was locked down on Jan. 23,2020, there was only one confirmed case in the United States. When the U.S. on Feb. 2 closed its borders to all Chinese citizens and foreigners who had been to China over the past 14 days, it reported merely more than 10 confirmed cases. When the U.S. declared a state of emergency on March 13, the country's COVID-19 tally was 1,896. When the Chinese government lifted the lockdown on Wuhan on April 8, the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. reached 400,000. The country saw its tally rise from one to 1 million in less than 100 days. Currently, the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. has exceeded 5.69 million with the death toll over 170,000.  -- From the onset of COVID-19, the largest emergency humanitarian operation in the history of the People's Republic of China has been carried out. The nation widely shared its experience in COVID-19 prevention and control, provided medical supplies and dispatched medical teams to where they were needed overseas. By early May, seven versions of the diagnosis and treatment guidelines and six versions of the prevention and control guidelines had been made public through an online knowledge center. A 2-billion-yuan special fund had been set up to fight COVID-19, and over 120 video conferences had been held with experts and officials from more than 160 countries and international organizations. Medical supplies had been provided to more than 150 countries and international organizations, and 29 Chinese medical teams had been sent to 27 countries. China set up a joint expert group with the EU, and established a prevention and control cooperation mechanism with the Republic of Korea. China sent a cash donation of 50 million U.S. dollars to the World Health Organization, pledged to make COVID-19 vaccines global public goods, and provided the world with more than 70 billion face masks. In response to the G20 call for debt repayment moratorium for the poorest countries, China has agreed to suspend principal and interest repayments on the debts of 77 developing countries due from May 1 to the end of this year. The international community commended China's help and support which reflected the spirit of sharing weal and woe and helping each other, and further highlighted the importance of building a community with a shared future for mankind.  -- On May 1, the website of U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report by CDC Principal Deputy Chief Anne Schuchat and CDC COVID-19 response team, which showed that after the United States' first confirmed case was reported on Jan. 21, the pandemic seemed to be brought under control in February, but then intensified rapidly. Factors including a continued rise in imported cases, mass gatherings, the introduction of the virus into high-risk workplaces and densely populated areas, and limited testing that led to covert and asymptomatic transmissions, accelerated the spread of the virus in February and March.  -- New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo pointed to a research by Northeastern University showing that the first strain of the novel coronavirus entering his state was not from China. The New York Times quoted American experts who confirmed that most New York coronavirus cases did not come from Asia.  -- Statistics from several major Canadian provinces showed that the virus was introduced into Canada by American travelers. A study by France's Pasteur Institute found that the source of the virus strain transmitted locally was unknown. Russia reported no imported cases from China. Data from the Australian Government Department of Health showed that the proportion of imported cases from Northeast Asia was extremely small. Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases said the pandemic that spread in Japan after March did not originate in China.  -- As the New York Times pointed out in an article titled Why is the U.S. exporting coronavirus, the United States, with the largest number of COVID-19 cases in the world, is continuing to deport thousands of immigrants, many infected with the coronavirus. In late April, the Guatemalan government reported that nearly a fifth of the country's coronavirus cases were linked to deportees from the United States. Seventy-one of 76 deportees tested positive for the coronavirus.  10. Mike Pompeo: The world would be much better if doctors in Wuhan had been allowed to raise the alarm about the outbreak of a new and novel virus.  False.  Fact check: On Aug. 3, Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of medical journal The Lancet, wrote in an article in The Guardian, saying that Chinese doctors quickly warned their government and their government warned the world, but Western nations failed to listen to those warnings. To blame China for this pandemic is to rewrite the history of COVID-19 and to marginalize the failings of Western nations.  -- The novel coronavirus is unknown to mankind. It takes a process to study and understand it. As one of the first countries hit by the virus, China undertook a closed-book exam, which means developing effective prevention and control measures requires more careful research beforehand. Jumping to conclusions without research shows no sense of responsibility to science and to the people.  -- China has been open, transparent, rapid and effective in its response to COVID-19, with no cover-ups or delays. On Dec. 27, 2019, Dr. Zhang Jixian, director of the respiratory and critical care medicine department at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, reported suspected cases. After that China took rapid actions, carried out etiological and epidemiological investigations, and blocked the spreading of the epidemic. China's information sharing has been timely. Starting from Jan. 3, 2020, China provided epidemic updates on a regular basis to the World Health Organization and foreign countries including the United States. China carried out international cooperation, shared the genome sequence of the virus with other countries at the earliest time possible, and shared its epidemic prevention and control experience. The United States ignored the warnings from China. Now out of political motives, it is wantonly questioning China's transparency. Such a move is utter disrespect for the tremendous efforts and sacrifices of the Chinese people.  -- After the COVID-19 outbreak, the vast majority of Chinese medical workers, bearing in mind their supreme mission of safeguarding the lives and health of the people, rushed to the front line of epidemic prevention and control without hesitation, raced against time to rescue patients, fought against the disease, and created one medical miracle after another. Their professional ethics, professionalism and strong will are highly recognized by people from all walks of life in China. The Chinese government has unveiled a slew of measures to protect and care for medical staff and commended them with awards and honors. Zhang Dingyu, head of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, and Zhang Jixian, the doctor at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine who first reported the COVID-19 cases, have gotten a merit award. Many medical staff and medical teams were honored with the May Fourth Medals, and eight medical workers, including Li Wenliang, were honored posthumously. Recently, Zhong Nanshan was awarded the Medal of the Republic, while Zhang Boli, Zhang Dingyu and Chen Wei were awarded the national honorary title ""the People's Hero"" to honor their significant contribution to the fight against COVID-19.  -- U.S. politicians have put politics above science, ignored the reality of their incompetence in fighting the epidemic, and repeatedly criticized the epidemic prevention and control advice raised by Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci said he and his family had received death threats and had to get extra security. Recently, over 3,000 U.S. public health experts signed an open letter, criticizing the efforts of White House officials to discredit Fauci. Calling the COVID-19 pandemic the greatest challenge the United States has faced in its history, the open letter said the attempt of the White House to discredit and marginalize Fauci is a dangerous distraction. The Washington Post commented on July 20 that under the guidance of the U.S. government, many Americans believe scientists and mainstream media have exaggerated the severity of the pandemic or even fabricated the pandemic, and that resistance to scientific experts has become part of the political agenda. A New York Times report cited the experience of Dr. Helen Y. Chu, the U.S. whistleblower, and a team of researchers, saying that faced with a public health emergency on a scale potentially not seen in a century, the United States has not responded nimbly. The professional advice of Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was unkindly treated by senior U.S. health officials. He was ousted from his position after refusing to allow wide use of the medicine in accordance with government orders. The official website of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped updating in early March and deleted relevant data on the number of people tested for the novel coronavirus and the number of deaths.  11. Mike Pompeo: The massive imbalances in the U.S.-China relationship have built up over decades. Chinese trade abuses sucked supply chains away from America, cost American jobs and strike enormous blows to the economies all across America.  False.  Fact check: In today's era of globalization, the interests of all countries are deeply intertwined. The formation and development of the global industrial chain and supply chain is the result of the joint work of market rule and the choice of enterprises. China and the United States have become each other's most important trading partner and investment destination, as well as a community of shared interests deeply connected by industrial, supply and service chains.  -- The Sino-U.S. relationship is defined by equality, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. It has been based on mutual benefit from the very beginning. China owes nothing to the United States. In Sino-U.S. economic and trade cooperation, China receives capital, technology and management experience from the United States, while the United States has gained market share in China and occupied the high end of the global industrial chain and value chain. Both countries have benefited greatly from their cooperation with each other. Through complementary and mutually beneficial cooperation with China, the U.S. economy has achieved faster growth, American families have saved significant costs of living, and American companies have gained handsome profits. Both China and the United States have achieved remarkable development and progress through cooperation, bringing tangible benefits to the two countries and their peoples.  -- Sino-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is essentially mutually beneficial and win-win. China and the United States are each other's largest trading partner and important source of investment. In 2018, their bilateral trade exceeded 630 billion U.S. dollars and the stock of two-way investment exceeded 240 billion U.S. dollars. Statistics of the U.S.-China Business Council in May 2019 showed that between 2009 and 2018, China was one of the fastest-growing markets for U.S. goods exports, with an average annual growth rate of 6.3 percent and a cumulative growth rate of 73.2 percent, much higher than the average growth rate of 56.9 percent to the rest of the world. By the end of 2018, Chinese enterprises had invested 73.17 billion U.S. dollars in the United States. Chinese investment in the United States has made positive contribution to the development of local communities, and the increase in jobs and tax revenue. During COVID-19, China once again became the largest trading partner of the United States. In May 2020, bilateral trade rose to 46.5 billion U.S. dollars, and China's holding of U.S. Treasury bonds exceeded 1.08 trillion U.S. dollars.  -- American enterprises have invested in more than 70,000 businesses in China, with annual sales of 700 billion U.S. dollars, and 97 percent of them are profitable. There are only two single markets that account for more than 10 percent of Apple's global revenue. One is the U.S. market, with a total revenue of 96.6 billion U.S. dollars, and the other is the Chinese market. In 2017, General Motors' sales in the Chinese market accounted for 42 percent of its global sales, and were 1 million units more than the sales in the U.S. market. Qualcomm's chip sales and patent license fees in China accounted for 57 percent of its total revenue. According to a survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in May 2020, 84 percent of American enterprises are unwilling to withdraw from China, 38 percent of American enterprises will maintain or increase their investment in China, and China is still the most favored market for American enterprises.  -- Sino-U.S. economic and trade cooperation has brought tangible benefits to the American people. For more than 40 years, bilateral trade in goods between China and the United States has increased by more than 250 times, supporting about 2.6 million jobs in the United States. About 72,500 U.S. enterprises have invested in China and most of them have benefited a lot.  According to the 2019 State Export Report released by the U.S.-China Business Council on May 1, 2019, U.S. exports to China supported more than 1.1 million jobs in the United States from 2009 to 2018 and 97 percent of the U.S. companies surveyed said doing business with China was profitable. Chinese investment in America had spread across 46 states, directly creating more than 140,000 jobs in America. Trade between China and the United States saved each American family an average cost of 850 U.S. dollars per year, equivalent to 1.5 percent of the household income in America. According to the U.S. Travel Association, Chinese tourists spend an average of 7,000 U.S. dollars per trip to the United States, including air tickets and accommodation.  -- The main causes of unemployment among certain groups in the American society are the mistakes of U.S. economic policies and the lack of redistributive and reemployment mechanisms in the context of technological progress and economic restructuring. Arthur R. Kroeber, a member of the National Committee on United States-China Relations, told the Asia Society that the problem with the hit to American employment over the past few decades was the failure of the United States to adjust its domestic policies in a timely manner. A report by the Cato Institute, a U.S. think tank, noted that U.S. manufacturing job losses and worker losses had little to do with Chinese imports.  -- According to a Cato Institute report, American consumers have benefited greatly from Sino-U.S. trade. From 2004 to 2015, due to imports from China, U.S. consumer price index dropped by an average 0.19 percent annually, effectively easing inflation in the United States. Sino-U.S. trade helps, not hurts, American manufacturers and workers. It is estimated that out of every U.S. dollar Americans spend on ""made in China"" products in 2018, 56 cents went to American companies and workers, and importing Chinese products has helped American manufacturing become more competitive, invest more and innovate more.  -- The United States unilaterally provoked a trade war with China, and this will ultimately damage its own interests. The Peterson Institute for International Economics projected that raising tariffs on imported automobiles would cause about 195,000 U.S. workers to lose their jobs. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated that due to the additional tariffs imposed on 250 billion U.S. dollars of Chinese exports in 2018, U.S. consumers would have to spend an extra 52.8 billion U.S. dollars every year. That is 414 U.S. dollars more in expenditure for every American family.  Recently, 160 American companies submitted a joint letter to the U.S. Congress, demanding the cancellation of the additional tariffs on China, saying that in 2019, due to the additional tariffs, the U.S. public paid an extra 50 billion U.S. dollars, which is 1,277 U.S. dollars on average for each household, and the market value of U.S. listed companies shrank by 1.7 trillion U.S. dollars.  -- The U.S. attempt to forcibly ""decouple"" the Chinese and American economies, cut off the global industrial, supply and value chains, and disrupt the global economic and trade pattern poses the biggest threat to the safety of the industrial and supply chains of the two countries and the world at large. Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James B. Steinberg and former Assistant Secretary of State Phil Gordon argued that the Trump administration has overlooked the benefits that two generations of Americans have reaped from importing affordable consumer goods, low-cost inputs for high-end manufacturing exports, and growing U.S. export surpluses in services and agricultural products. The trade war or ""decoupling"" pursued by the Trump administration would hurt American workers, farmers and consumers. According to a study by Moody's Analytics, Trump's trade war with China has already cost the United States an estimated 300,000 jobs and an average of around 600 U.S. dollars per household from higher prices.  12.Mike Pompeo: China ripped off America's prized intellectual property and trade secrets.  False.  Fact check: China is a big country in terms of innovation and intellectual property (IP), and has kept strengthening the protection of scientific innovation and intellectual property. China is now among the world's leaders in terms of the scale and growth rate of innovation input. Its R&D expenditure had grown from 300.31 billion yuan in 2006 to 1.96779 trillion yuan in 2018, recording an average annual growth of 17 percent and rising from the sixth to the second in the world. China has the world's biggest number of researchers. China's IP offices have received the highest number of patent applications for nine years in a row. China has also registered rapid increase in international patent applications and grown into the world's second biggest filer of international patent applications via the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) System. The annual WIPO report recognizes China as a main driving force for intellectual property development in the world.  -- In recent years, China has continued to take effective measures, introduced a number of policies and measures to strengthen intellectual property, and intensified law enforcement and protection, which have produced remarkable results. The decision to amend the ""Trademark Law of the People's Republic of China"" has substantially raised the cost of infringement and violations. China has released the ""Guidelines on Strengthening Reform and Innovation in Intellectual Property Trials"" and the ""Guidelines on Strengthening the Protection of Intellectual Property,"" emphasizing the need to promote coordinated advancement of intellectual property protection and enhance the overall level of protection. China has joined almost all major international intellectual property treaties. In 2019, the country scored 78.98 points in terms of public satisfaction over intellectual property protection. According to the 2019 ""Business Confidence Survey"" report released by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, around 60 percent of the 585 EU companies interviewed regarded that China's administrative and judicial protection of intellectual property had been significantly strengthened. The International Intellectual Property Index report released by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in March 2019 specifically pointed out that China has made outstanding achievements in improving the online sales environment and drug patent enforcement. In the World Bank ""Doing Business 2020"" report, China lifted its ranking to the 31st slot, and made to the list of the top 10 improved economies for the second year in a row.  -- The Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress held an antitrust hearing on July 29 this year. When asked whether they believe the Chinese government is stealing technology from American companies, the CEOs of Apple, Google, and Amazon all said that they had not experienced such cases.  -- Yahoo News quoted U.S. government officials as saying that ""U.S. President Trump gave a secret order that gives more powers to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for cyberattacks."" This secret authorization makes it easier for the CIA to conduct covert cyber operations without the White House approval. Since the secret order was signed, the CIA has implemented at least 12 operations. On March 3 this year, Chinese cyber security company Qihoo 360 discovered that APT-C-39, a cyberattack organization of the CIA, had conducted cyberattacks on China for 11 years. During this period, China's aerospace companies, scientific research institutions, petroleum industry, large internet firms and government agencies have all suffered attacks to varying degrees.  13.Mike Pompeo: The Chinese Consulate-General in Houston is a hub of spying and intellectual property theft.  False.  Fact check: The United States fabricated false charges and forcibly closed the Chinese Consulate-General in Houston, with the aim of pushing for a ""decoupling"" between China and the United States. It is an important part of the U.S. strategy to suppress China and is strongly opposed by the vast majority of rational Americans.  -- The Consulate-General in Houston was the first Chinese consular mission opened in the United States following the establishment of China-U.S. diplomatic ties. In the past 41 years, it has worked hard to promote friendship and cooperation between the two peoples, and enhance mutual understanding and all-round cooperation between the two countries in various sectors. While COVID-19 raged on in the southern U.S. states, the Consulate-General donated masks to Houston and Harris County, and assisted Shanghai Municipality, Shandong Province and Shenzhen City of China in donating medical supplies to Houston.  -- The composition and number of the staff at the Consulate-General in Houston was open information to the U.S. side. To accuse the Consulate-General as the hub of Chinese spying and intellectual property theft runs against the common sense in diplomacy. Reports from Cable News Network (CNN), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), The Houston Chronicle and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) showed that closing the Chinese Consulate-General prior to the election was a measure by Trump to ""play tough on China"", hold up his declining approval rating and turn China into a convenient target to vilify and shore up votes. The New York Times questioned the assertion that ""the Houston Consulate-General had a history of engaging in 'subversive behavior' and was the 'epicenter' of research theft in the United States"", and believes that there is no evidence to support this allegation. Shocked by the decision of the U.S. government, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner expressed his hope that whatever the friction may be between the United States and China [it] can be resolved peacefully and that at some point in time the Consulate-General will reopen.  -- An editorial of The Houston Chronicle said China is the second-largest trading partner of the Houston region, and the region has benefited greatly from having the Consulate-General in the city. For more than 40 years, the Chinese Consulate-General has served as a symbolic bridge, facilitating travel, trade and cultural ties between Houston and China.  14.Mike Pompeo: Many Chinese students and employees come to the U.S. to steal intellectual property.  False.  Fact check: The United States cooked up false charges against the normal scientific, cultural and people-to-people exchanges and cooperation with China based on the presumption of guilt. Such actions run counter to its self-proclaimed ideas of openness and freedom, the public commitments made by U.S. leaders, and the global trend of personnel exchanges, and have caused serious and negative impact on people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.  -- The past four decades have seen growing cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two sides, with over 5 million mutual visits recorded every year. Exchanges and cooperation in education and scientific research, in particular, have yielded fruitful results and benefited both countries. China has been one of the most popular destinations for American students in the past 40 years, during which more than 330,000 American students have come to China to further their study. China has also been the largest source of overseas students for the United States for 10 consecutive years. In the 2018-2019 academic year alone, the number of Chinese students in the United States totaled 370,000, accounting for one third of the country's international students. In addition, as the statistics of the U.S. National Science Foundation suggest, China and the United States are each other's largest collaborating country in internationally co-authored papers and their interdependence far exceeds other countries.  -- It is in the interest of both sides to boost exchanges and cooperation in areas like science and technology. As shown in Global AI Talent Tracker, a report published in mid-June by the Paulson Institute's in-house think tank MacroPolo, America's big lead in AI is inseparable from China's talent pool, with nearly one third of these researchers completing their undergraduate education in China.  -- In his book The Gift of Global Talent, William Kerr, Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, said that inventors with Chinese descent accounted for over 10 percent of patents in the United States. In 2018, for example, Chinese students in the United States reached 370,000, bringing about 20 billion U.S. dollars of benefits to the U.S. economy. Turning a blind eye to the contribution of Chinese students and researchers and acting in disregard of the objection from their own scholars, American politicians are putting their own country's interests at stake.  -- After the U.S. Department of Homeland Security put out the announcement to bar international students taking only online classes from obtaining visas or maintaining current visas, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) filed a lawsuit against the action, contending that the order violates the Administrative Procedure Act, because the policy lacked reasonable justification and the public was not given notice to comment on it. Universities and institutions of higher learning across the country have joined Harvard and MIT in the lawsuit or filed lawsuits on their own. Many of them describe the new visa rules as ""policymaking at its worst,"" ""cruel and reckless"" and ""deeply misguided.""  -- For some time, the United States, out of its ideological bias, has made Chinese students and researchers the target of surveillance, harassment and willful detention, and fabricated absurd charges like ""espionage"" against Chinese scholars under the presumption of guilt. These U.S. actions have seriously violated the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and severely disrupted normal cultural and personnel exchanges between the two countries. Such practices are outright political persecution, which not only goes against morality and justice, but also hurts the United States' own image. MIT President Rafael Reif said in an open letter to the university in 2019 that the ""unfair scrutiny"" targeting Chinese would ""create a toxic atmosphere of unfounded suspicion and fear"", bringing harm to this world-renowned research university and the United States.  15.Mike Pompeo: China sends propagandists into the press conferences, schools, research institutions in the U.S.  False.  Fact check: These remarks have fully exposed the ideological prejudice of the U.S. side. Media organizations should not be judged by the political systems and ideologies of their countries, but the objectivity, authenticity, fairness and impartiality of their news reports. Each country has its own national conditions and ways of media management and operation. The United States should not judge other countries' media by its own standards and based on its own ideology. Chinese media organizations in the United States have always followed local laws and observed professional ethics. They have carried out news reporting normally and have never interfered in the internal affairs of the United States. Over the years, they have played an important and positive role in enhancing the objective understanding and friendliness of the Chinese people towards the United States.  -- In recent years, the U.S. government has imposed unwarranted restrictions on the normal news reporting of Chinese media outlets and their staff in the country. It has continuously escalated discrimination and political suppression against Chinese media and restricted their freedom. In December 2018, CGTN America was registered as a ""foreign agent"" under orders from the U.S. Department of Justice. On February 18, 2020, the U.S. State Department designated five Chinese media outlets, including Xinhua News Agency, as ""foreign missions"" and demanded personnel, property and other information from them. On March 2, the U.S. State Department announced that from March 13, the five Chinese media outlets designated as ""foreign missions"" have to slash the number of Chinese nationals permitted to work in America by 60, a 40 percent cut in staff members, which means de facto expulsion of the Chinese journalists stationed in the country.  -- The United States has for a long time imposed discriminatory visa policies on Chinese journalists. U.S.-based Chinese journalists are only granted single-entry visas, which means they have to reapply for visa after they leave for China or for a third country, and nine Chinese journalists have not been able to return to the United States after leaving the country. In contrast, the United States gives multiple-entry visas to journalists from other countries and regions. When applying for U.S. visa, Chinese journalists are often requested to provide substantial amount of additional documents. Meanwhile, it has become a common practice for the U.S. side to prolong and indefinitely delay the approval process and even deny the application in the name of administrative review. Statistics show that from 2018, more than 20 Chinese journalists have had their visa application indefinitely delayed and even denied. Some Chinese journalists applied for U.S. visa in mid-December 2019, but so far have not received any feedback from the U.S. side and their passports have not been returned either. In May 2020, the United States limited the duration of stay for U.S.-based Chinese journalists, including those based in the United Nations, to 90 days, which means they have to apply for a visa extension every 90 days. If the extension application is not approved, the journalists will be forced to leave America. This new move has seriously disrupted the normal reporting work of the Chinese media.  -- At present, there are about 500 foreign journalists based in China. China has provided active assistance to facilitate their work and life. Normally, the applications of foreign journalists for the extension of press cards get approved within 10 workdays. For a long time, U.S. journalists in China have been able to travel to and from China many times with their valid certificates without applying for new visas. In 2019 alone, U.S. resident journalists in China traveled to and from the country more than 700 times. China welcomes media outlets and journalists from all countries to report in China in accordance with laws and regulations, and will continue to facilitate and assist their work.  -- As of July 2020, a total of 28 U.S. media outlets have sent resident journalists to the Chinese mainland, with 34 offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. They have hired 29 U.S. journalists, 34 non-U.S. journalists and 135 employees. In addition, there are more than 20 U.S. media outlets operating in Hong Kong, with more than 400 staff. These U.S. journalists are free to attend press conferences held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ask questions without restriction. In recent years, some U.S. media outlets have concocted a lot of ""fake news"" with distorted facts, and pointed fingers at Xinjiang and Hong Kong affairs. They are sparing no effort to smear and attack China and even attack China's political system. China opposes ideological prejudice against it, opposes the fabrication of fake news under the pretext of so-called freedom of the press, and opposes acts that violate the professional ethics of journalism.  16.Mike Pompeo: Chinese companies do not answer to independent boards, and many of them are state-owned and have no need to pursue profits. A good example is Huawei.  False.  Fact check: The fourth national economic census of China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that by the end of 2018, there were 15.61 million private companies in the country, up 178.6 percent from the end of 2013, and 84.1 percent of total enterprises were private ones, up 68.3 percent. The number of state-controlled enterprises were about 242,000, accounting for only 1.3 percent of total enterprises.  -- Creating wealth and profits are the natural pursuit and the most important functions of businesses. NBS statistics revealed the following profits made by China's major industrial enterprises (with an annual business turnover of at least 20 million yuan each) in 2019: 1.64 trillion yuan by state-controlled enterprises, 4.53 trillion yuan by joint-equity enterprises, 1.56 trillion yuan by foreign as well as Hong Kong-, Macao- and Taiwan-invested enterprises, and 1.82 trillion yuan by private enterprises.  -- In China's economic system, the private sector contributes to over 50 percent of tax revenue, over 60 percent of GDP, over 70 percent of technological innovation, and over 80 percent of urban employment, and accounts for over 90 percent of the number of enterprises.  -- Huawei is a leading private enterprise, and 100 percent employee-owned. The Chinese government has no shares in Huawei, which adopts an employee shareholding scheme involving 104,572 people through its trade union. Only Huawei employees are eligible to participate, and no government departments or organizations have any shares in Huawei.  17.Mike Pompeo: Huawei is not an innocent telecommunications company but a national security threat to the U.S.  False.  Fact check: Over the past three decades, Huawei has grown from a small company to one of the world's largest telecommunications equipment suppliers, providing quality services to over 3 billion people in more than 170 countries and regions. The company has brought enormous business opportunities to the global telecommunications industry and won a good international reputation. Each year, Huawei makes nearly 80 billion U.S. dollars of purchases globally from 13,000 suppliers in more than 140 countries. Purchases from the U.S. alone was nearly 19 billion dollars.  -- Huawei strictly abides by local laws wherever it operates. The company has long been expressing its readiness to sign no-backdoor and no-eavesdropping agreements with any country, set up cybersecurity testing centers and open itself to testing. This is enough to prove Huawei's innocence and transparency. So far, not a single country, a single company or a single individual has been able to produce solid and conclusive evidence to prove that Huawei poses a security threat to them. Huawei funded a cybersecurity testing center in the United Kingdom and opens itself to testing by UK experts. No other companies in any other country could do this, and no U.S. companies could act in such an open and honest way.  -- Huawei owns a total of 87,805 patents worldwide, of which more than 90 percent are invention patents, including 11,152 core ones granted by the U.S. authorities. According to the latest statistics from German market intelligence company IPlytics, Huawei has declared the largest number of 5G essential patents, accounting for 15.05 percent of the total number of declarations. The Patent Index 2019 of the European Patent Office suggested that Huawei was its top applicant that year, with its declared 5G essential patents outnumbering all U.S. companies.  -- The U.S. government has, with no factual basis at all, abused state power to willfully oppress and sanction Huawei under the pretext of national security. This is nothing short of economic bullying. For the United States, the so-called national security is nothing but a code name of hegemony.  -- In an analysis titled Huawei and the Mantra of Security published on July 20, 2020, Xulio Rios, director of the Spanish Observatory of Chinese Politics in Spain, said the repeated use of national security to discredit Huawei looks like a good story. He mentioned that the truth behind the U.S. pressure on its allies to block Huawei is that ""Huawei's technology is highly competitive and places China ahead in the marketplace."" They are trying to curb China's development by classifying Huawei as a ""security"" threat.  -- Jeffrey Sachs, the economics professor at Columbia University, agrees that targeting Huawei is never simply a security concern. ""The U.S. concocted in my opinion, the view that Huawei is a global threat,"" he said, noting that the U.S. has leaned very hard on its allies...to try to break the relations with Huawei. ""The United States lost its step on 5G, which is a critical part of the new digital economy.""  -- According to U.S. media reports, the U.S. Rural Wireless Association (RWA) estimates that 25 percent of its members had Huawei or ZTE equipment in their networks. Replacing the equipment would cost 800 million to 1 billion U.S. dollars, which means certain U.S. rural areas may lose basic communications facilities. Banning the purchase of Huawei and ZTE equipment or services by rural operators, as advocated by some in the U.S., could end up harming the interests of American businesses and consumers.  18.Mike Pompeo: Countries should become Clean Countries so that their citizens' private information doesn't end up in the hand of the CCP.  False.  Fact check: The U.S. administration has generalized the concept of national security, resorted to the presumption of guilt and state power to hold down Chinese enterprises, and intervened in the economy with political means. All this has run counter to the free market, fair competition and entrepreneurship that the U.S. has been advocating globally for many years, seriously disrupted the order of the market economy, and violated WTO rules. These acts have undermined the open, transparent, inclusive and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system, affected the development prospects of the global 5G and digital industries, and damaged the common interests of all countries in the world.  -- The Chinese government has never asked, and will not ask its enterprises or individuals to violate local laws, and to collect or provide data, information and intelligence of foreign countries through the installation of ""backdoor"" or other ways.  -- The Chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of personal privacy of citizens and has been committed to improving laws and regulations on the protection of personal privacy. Chinese laws and regulations, such as its Civil Code, the Cybersecurity Law and the decision of the NPC Standing Committee on strengthening online information protection, have clear stipulations on the collection, use and protection of personal information.  -- After the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. adopted the USA Patriot Act that requires Internet companies to provide users' information on a regular basis. The ""Prism Gate"" incident has exposed that under the monitoring of U.S. intelligence agencies, U.S. citizens have no personal privacy in their phone calls, communications, documents, voice mail and other data. The phone calls of leaders of countries, who used to be very close allies of the United States, have also been eavesdropped by the U.S. for a long time. Facts have shown that it is the United States that has carried out the largest network surveillance and espionage operations in the world, and the U.S. is the largest ""hacker empire"" in the world. For this, the United Nations adopted the resolution ""Privacy in the Digital Age"" initiated by European countries.  -- In May 2019, the Der Tagesspiegel of Germany reported that after years of scrutiny by the British government, the German Federal Office for Information Security, the European Commission and other agencies, no obvious ""backdoor"" has been found on Huawei equipment. However, security flaws are often found in the equipment provided by the U.S. company Cisco. Since 2013, Cisco has been involved in at least 10 cases, which are more in line with the description of the so-called ""backdoor"".  -- There are security flaws in Cisco's devices, and many ""backdoor"" incidents have been reported. Cisco deliberately sold video surveillance technology containing serious security vulnerabilities to government agencies, and was sued by video surveillance experts of its distributor NetDesign. In 2019, Cisco eventually paid 8.6 million U.S. dollars to settle claims for its act of ""leaving backdoor"" .  -- As early as in 2014, Apple admitted that it could extract personal data such as SMS, address book and photos of its mobile phone users through the backdoor of Apple's mobile phone system. Its CEO Tim Cook said publicly that ""China has never asked us to unlock the iPhone, but the U.S. has asked for it."" Facebook was also revealed to have a backdoor to its users' accounts.  19.Mike Pompeo: China has set up concentration camps in Xinjiang.  False.  Fact check: There are no so-called ""concentration camps"" in Xinjiang, and its vocational education and training centers were established in accordance with the law. The centers are similar in nature to community correction programs of the United States, the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) of the UK, and the deradicalization center of France, all beneficial attempts and positive explorations for preventive counter-terrorism and de-extremism. They are consistent with the principles and spirit of a series of counter-terrorism resolutions, including the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  -- It is a practice with ulterior motives for some U.S. politicians and media to call Xinjiang vocational education and training centers ""concentration camps"". The Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a non-governmental organization supported by the U.S. government, has come to the absurd conclusion that 10 percent of Xinjiang's 20 million population are detained in the so-called ""concentration camps"", simply based on its interviews with eight people and rough estimates.  A survey by Grayzone, a U.S. news website, revealed that Adrian Zenz, a pseudo scholar, had fabricated the rumor that the total of detainees in Xinjiang exceeded 1 million based on a report by Istiqlal TV, a Turkey-based exile media organization. According to Grayzone, rather than being an impartial news organization, Istiqlal TV has advocated separatism and received all kinds of extremists. Even Adrian Zenz himself admitted that he was uncertain with his estimate.  -- For some years, Xinjiang has been a victim of terrorism and extremism. According to preliminary statistics, between 1990 and the end of 2016, ethnic separatists, religious extremists and violent terrorists have plotted and carried out several thousand acts of terrorism, resulting in the death of a large number of innocent civilians, the killing of several hundred police officers, and huge property losses.  Thanks to the law-based anti-terrorism, deradicalization and vocational education and training in Xinjiang, there have been no violent terrorist cases in the region for more than three years, and people of all ethnic groups have acquired a notably stronger sense of fulfillment, happiness and security.  -- Vocational education and training centers in Xinjiang have focused on the main problems facing the trainees, such as low proficiency in spoken and written Mandarin, lack of understanding in the law and occupational skills, and influence by religious extremism to various degrees. A curriculum that includes standard spoken and written Mandarin, legal courses, vocational skills and deradicalization has been developed, aiming at eliminating the root causes of terrorism and religious extremism.  The centers strictly implement the basic principles of respecting and protecting human rights enshrined in China's Constitution and laws, fully respect and guarantee the trainees' personal freedom and freedom of religious belief, the right to use their spoken and written languages, and the customs of different ethnic groups. There are access to various living facilities, and legal and mental counseling rooms. All trainees are covered by public pension and medical insurance schemes, and are entitled to free health examination.  So far, all the trainees involved i"

In the biggest and boldest protests since Thailand’s 2014 coup, students and young activists – intent on shaking up a stultifying political order – are taking on the country’s most powerful players: King Maha Vajiralongkorn and general-turned-Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.  Borrowing from Harry Potter, the Hunger Games and other pop culture hits, thousands of protesters have been holding near-daily demonstrations for more than a month.  They are calling for systemic democratic reforms – the dissolution of parliament, an end to harassment of opponents, amendments to the constitution – as well as curbs on the king’s powers, a long-standing taboo in Thailand where criticism of the monarchy is punishable with up to 15 years in jail.  “It’s all very exciting,” said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a Thai academic and prominent critic of the monarchy who lives in exile in Japan. “The protesters are young; they are social media savvy. They use new and creative tactics in their protests. They have many different leaders. And most importantly, they have clear demands. This could be a new turning point in Thai politics.”  The triggers of the protests – which appear to be gathering momentum, recently drawing in high school students and labour unions – are wide-ranging.  Key among them is the close ties between the monarchy and the military, an alliance some protesters have denounced as “enemy to the principles of democracy”.  Prayuth, who seized power after Thailand’s second coup in as many decades, scrapped the country’s constitution in 2014 and had the military write a new charter that increased the king’s powers and entrenched the pro-military royalists.  The document, ratified in April 2017, months after King Vajiralongkorn took the throne, removed the need for the monarch to appoint a regent when he travelled overseas, and allowed the military to appoint a 250-member Senate that was to have a say in selecting the new prime minister.  In a long-delayed general election that was finally held in March last year, the pro-military Palang Pracharat came second but Prayuth remained prime minister, with the backing of the unelected Senate and the support of smaller parties.  ‘Closer to an absolute monarchy’  At the same time, King Vajiralongkorn was moving to consolidate his personal position.  In July 2017, the military-appointed legislative assembly amended the royal property law to give the king full control of the Crown Property Bureau, which manages the crown’s estimated $30bn fortune.  Then, in October of last year, the king also placed two army units directly under his control, moves Joshua Kurlantzick, at the Council on Foreign Relations, called an indication of Vajiralongkorn’s intent to push the country “closer to an absolute monarchy”.  Writing in the World Politics Review, Kurlantzick said the new king was not like his late revered father, Bhumibol Adulyadej, who intervened in politics in secret or via proxies. Instead, Vajiralongkorn has “managed to maneuver himself to the centre of Thai politics, decreasing the power of both the army and politicians along the way”.  Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha standing in front of a portrait of King Maha Vajiralongkorn while receiving a copy of a July 16 speech by the monarch at a ceremony in Bangkok [File: Handout/ Royal Thai government via AFP]  The new king’s overt involvement in politics – combined with his preference to spend much of his time outside Thailand, even during the coronavirus pandemic – prompted a backlash, with critics taking to Twitter in March to question the role of the monarch. The hashtag #whydoweneedaking started trending and on March 22, it was used more than 1.2 million times, prompting a government minister to warn Thais against breaking laws on online content.  Thongchai Winichakul, professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the 2014 coup “brought back strong waves of ultra-royalism” to Thai society, boosting the king’s standing. At the same time, “it is no secret that the coup regime remains in power due to the support of the palace,” he said.  Crackdown  Meanwhile, critics say the deepening entrenchment of the monarchy and the military in Thailand’s central political scene has been accompanied by a crackdown on opponents.  Late last year, the Constitutional Court disqualified Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a 41-year-old billionaire popular with young voters, from the parliament for holding shares in a media company on the date he registered as a candidate for the election.  Then, in February, the top court went on to dissolve Thanathorn’s fledgling pro-democracy Future Forward Party, which rode a wave of popular support to win the third-highest number of seats in parliament. The disbanding of the party prompted protests at the Chulalongkorn University in central Bangkok, with students laying out a funeral wreath labelled, “RIP Democracy”.  “The rapid rise and success of the Future Forward Party in the 2019 election was phenomenal,” said Thongchai. “The main source of its success is the young generation. In retrospect, it represented the brewing dissatisfaction that is erupting today. The Future Forward Party was outspoken on many issues including opposing the building up of military force under the direct command of the palace.”  He added, “Only politically naive people would believe that the party’s dissolution has nothing to do with its progressive politics and its criticism of the monarchy.”  The student protests, after subsiding briefly because of the pandemic, resumed in June following the disappearance of Wanchalearm Satsaksit, a dissident who was kidnapped from outside his apartment in Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh. He was the ninth Thai activist to have disappeared from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam after fleeing the 2014 coup, according to rights groups.  The demonstrations gathered pace in late July, with several protesters burning portraits of Prayuth near the Government House in the capital, Bangkok, and scores more staging a run around the city’s Democracy Monument, singing an altered jingle to the Japanese cartoon, Hamtaro. The revised lyrics described the government as hungry hamsters devouring taxpayer money.  A Harry Potter-themed protest followed on August 3, with hundreds of people dressed in wizard costumes waving chopstick-wands in the air and casting mock-spells to protect Thai democracy. There, for the first time in decades, Anon Nampa, a 35-year-old human rights lawyer, openly called for reforms to the monarchy.  “We must be able to speak about this publicly,” he told the crowd. “If we don’t discuss it, we will never be able to fix the problem … I speak so that the institution can exist in the society rightfully, under a democracy with the king as head of state.”  Anon Nampa, right and other pro-democracy protesters dressed as wizards attend a Harry Potter-themed protest demanding the resignation of Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha in Bangkok, Thailand, August 3, 2020 [Athit Perawongmetha/ Reuters]  A group of students followed up Anon’s speech with an even more detailed call for reform, presenting a 10-point plan on August 10, calling on the king not to “endorse further coups” and to revoke the country’s harsh lese majeste laws.  The declaration from the Student Union of the Thammasat University lambasted the “mutually beneficial” ties between the army and the military, saying, “Such a situation constitutes an enemy to the principles of a democracy with the king as head of the state.”  ‘Young people are fed up’  On August 16, an even larger crowd of more than 10,000 people gathered in Bangkok, in support of the students’ call for democracy and monarchy reform. Two days later, pupils at more than a dozen Thai high schools raised the three-finger Hunger Games salute, while many others sported white ribbons in a show of support for the protesters.

It has also moved to shut down online forums for debate, including a Facebook Page called the Royalist Marketplace, run by Pavin, the exiled academic in Japan.  But with Prayuth saying the king did not want prosecutions under the lese majeste laws, none of those detained has been charged under the harsh laws.  Wheeler said the student protests had put Prayuth’s government in a tough spot.  “The government will not easily relinquish their power and privileges. But there is little they can do at this point to quash the movement, short of repression on a massive scale that would hardly serve their interests,” he said.  “It is also likely that any crackdown will cause a backlash against the government and greater support for those demanding change.”"

Detailed analysis of strategies adopted by banks and other institutions to market debit, credit, and charge cards.  Market Highlights    The central bank is taking steps to promote digital payments in the country. It launched Payment Systems Roadmap No.4 (2019-2021), which is a continuation to the previously introduced Payment Systems Roadmap and National E-Payment Master Plan. The new plan aims to further develop digital payments between 2019 and 2021. Key areas emphasized by the roadmap include creating an interoperable payment infrastructure, developing a biometric standard for authentication of identities, developing a cross-border payment and fund transfer service, and promoting widespread usage of digital payments.    The lack of payment acceptance infrastructure has made the adoption of alternative payment methods compelling. QR code payments have thus gained prominence in Thailand, and are driving electronic payments. In May 2017, Mastercard, UnionPay, and Visa introduced the Thai QR Code payment system. The feature was also integrated into the PromptPay service in the last quarter of 2017. This system enables merchants to receive payments more easily in a cost-effective manner. As of August 2019 over 5 million merchants had accepted payments via QR codes in Thailand, up from 3 million in December 2018. To further promote this option, in February 2020 the central bank announced plans to introduce QR code payments for cross-border transactions to Singapore, Myanmar, and Cambodia. The service is expected to launch in Q3 2020.    COVID-19 has created stress across financial markets worldwide. In response, central banks are accelerating efforts to support the economy by slashing interest rates and boosting liquidity. In April 2020 the central bank introduced a new guideline called Credit Assistance Measures for credit card loans. As per the guidelines, the minimum payment rate on credit card loans was reduced from 10% to 5% to December 2021.

The COVID-19 crisis has complicated efforts to combat the seasonal spike in dengue fever infections during the Southeast Asian monsoon season due to the burden the coronavirus pandemic has placed on health authorities in the region, experts say.  Dengue is carried by mosquitoes and is one of the world’s most dangerous and fastest spreading viral diseases. While infections have decreased significantly from the sharp rise experienced in 2019, residents in one of the worst-hit nations, Laos, complain that authorities are not doing enough to prevent it during the current rainy season.  “I am afraid of it — afraid because there are no preventive measures,” said a resident of Bolikhamxay province, which has the second-highest number of infections in Laos after the capital Vientiane. The man declined to give his name for fear of angering authorities.  The prevention of dengue depends upon effective and sustained control measures. These include spraying insecticides in and around homes and emptying stagnant water from tree holes, old tires, and discarded containers, so they don't become breeding grounds for mosquitoes.  But experts say that poor public health infrastructure in many low- and middle-income countries in Southeast Asian countries has been stretched to its limits this year, as medical professionals focus on treating patients with the COVID-19 respiratory virus.  “Unfortunately, COVID-19 has impacted a range of routine health-related programs in many countries,” said Dr. Raman Velayudhan of the World Health Organization’s Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases in Geneva, Switzerland.  “Maintaining the delivery of essential health services and preventive measures, including vector control programs, has been challenging for some countries,” he said.

Credit: AFP  Experts cite rapid urbanization, high-density settlements, and climate change for an overall surge in dengue since the beginning of the century. According to the WHO, dengue has become one of the fastest emerging and spreading viral infections in Southeast Asia with high incidences in recent years in Laos, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines.  Unlike malaria which spreads mostly in rural areas, dengue is more of a problem in towns and cities. It is transmitted to humans through bites by female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in subtropical and tropical regions, especially during a critical period from July to November.  Typical symptoms include fever, headache, nausea, muscle and joint pains, and a skin rash. But with four dengue virus strains, it is possible for people to be infected subsequent times, increasing the risk of developing severe dengue, a potentially fatal complication.  This year, government-mandated lockdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19 may have increased the risk of dengue infections in some urban areas where both viral infections are prevalent, experts said.  “Mandated lockdowns mean people are spending more time in the home, where most transmissions of dengue from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes occur,” said Scott O’Neill, director of the World Mosquito Program, in a printed statement.  “Many dengue control measures — such as removal of potential mosquito breeding sites by local residents — have also ceased,” he said. “Health workers who usually promote this work in the community are working from home or many have been reassigned to their local COVID-19 response.”  Another complicating factor is that medical professionals may have difficulty distinguishing between COVID-19 and dengue, which both have similar clinical and laboratory features in their early stages.  “Where the impact has probably been greatest has been in the differential diagnosis and in treating dengue patients, mainly because the focus has been on COVID-19,” said Duane Gubler, a dengue expert at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. “Most fevers are being diagnosed and managed as COVID-19.”  Lao health workers empty stagnant water from a large outdoor container to prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs in the Vientiane capital region in an undated photo. Credit: RFA  Laos registered a cumulative 4,155 reported dengue cases as of Aug. 9 in line with seasonally expected levels, according to the WHO. Among the cases were nine deaths, including the most recent fatality in Vientiane prefecture’s Hadxayfong district.  “We haven’t seen them [authorities] come to spray to kill the dengue mosquito carriers,” said a Vientiane resident, who declined to give his name while criticizing authorities.  The man said he and his neighbors must continually empty rainwater from outdoor containers where it collects to prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs and to destroy their larvae.  “If the officials come down to spray in all the places where it’s needed, then the prevention of the disease would have more effective results,” he said.  An official from the Lao Ministry of Health, who declined to give his name because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said that the government has notified provincial authorities to enact prevention plans.  “Our ministry sent out notices to the provinces, and the provinces then sent them out to the districts, so that districts can carry out prevention plans to get rid of items that collect water around homes and to clean up their surroundings,” he told RFA’s Lao Service.  Dale Amtsberg, communications director at the nonprofit World Mosquito Program, said that there is a multiyear cycle with dengue fever, “so there are years with high numbers of cases and years with fewer cases.”  A laboratory assistant examines mosquito samples at the Pasteur Institute in the southern Vietnamese city of Nha Trang, Aug. 21, 2019. Credit: AFP  The year 2019 was a particularly bad one in a number of Southeast Asian nations, and 2020 is looking better, with a sharp decrease in reported dengue infections so far in those countries.  The number of cases reported in Laos this year is 5.5 times lower compared to the same period in 2019 when 22,737 cases were reported, according to WHO figures.  In neighboring Vietnam, the total cumulative number of dengue cases this year as of Aug. 2, was 48,484 with three deaths — a 64.1 percent decrease on the same period in 2019.  As of July 19, Cambodia has registered 4,450 dengue cases with five deaths — about one-tenth of the cases reported during the same period in 2019. Myanmar also has seen a fall.  But prosperous Singapore has gone in the opposite direction. As of Aug. 16, it reported more than 25,000 dengue cases with about 20 deaths, compared with 16,000 cases in all of 2019, according to the country’s National Environment Agency.  The number of cases spiked in 2019 because it was an El Niño year that contributed to changed weather patterns in South and Southeast Asia, Dr. Velayudhan said.  “Traditionally monsoonal seasons over a shorter period were replaced in some places with showers scattered over several months, creating multiple opportunities for mosquito breeding and prolonging the survival of mosquitoes as opposed to their lifespan in a short monsoon season,” he said.  One pharmacist’s prescription  Dealing with dengue effectively when it strikes depends on quick action, experts say. Although there is no specific treatment for dengue or its potentially fatal severe form, early detection and access to proper medical care lowers fatality rates of severe dengue to below 1 percent, according to the WHO.  The problem is many people do not seek medical help when they contract dengue. In places like Laos, where the health care is usually poor, those with dengue infections often forego a trip to a district or provincial hospital, instead preferring to buy medicine locally to take at home.  A pharmacy owner in the country’s northwestern Xayaburi province, which has reported a significant number of dengue fever cases this year, including one death, says locals often come to him for medicine to treat dengue.  “If they do not want to go to the hospital, I will sell them a bag of intravenous fluid together with paracetamol if they are not yet in a serious condition,” he said, referring to acetaminophen tablets that relieve and reduce fever. The saline infusion he gives them helps dengue fever sufferers maintain enough water in their body, he said.  Meanwhile, experts are urging authorities this year to sustain spraying with insecticides both outdoors and indoors to kill mosquitoes, so dengue doesn’t present an even bigger drain on health care systems already creaking because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Bridget Wills, a dengue expert associated with the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, said these control methods are labor intensive, but “you have to keep doing them.”    Additional reporting by RFA’s Lao Service.

In Hong Kong, the recent arrest of Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai highlighted the threat posed by the city’s new national security law, which China imposed while the world was distracted by the pandemic. The law effectively criminalizes dissent toward Beijing and allows the seizure of “journalistic materials.”  Governments in places like Thailand, Brazil, and Hungary have used the pandemic crisis as a pretext to limit access to information. Even democracies like South Africa have created sanctions against the publication of information deemed to be false.  Smaller countries out of the global news spotlight have also introduced some particularly harsh measures. Cambodia has increased arrests and harassment of journalists and banned publication of “information that could generate public alarm or fear.” The Inter American Press Association stated in August that state intimidation and harassment of the press in Nicaragua has worsened during the pandemic, citing a record of 351 cases of online smears, censorship, and other attacks during the lockdown.  “You need basic security tools just to make sure you don’t get hacked — in life, period — but it really is now your responsibility as a journalist to have good digital hygiene,” says journalist Gisela Pérez de Acha, who also works as a cybersecurity expert at the Human Rights Center Investigation Lab at the University of California, Berkeley. “Surveillance was already pervasive before the pandemic, but the thing right now is that certain kinds of surveillance are being legitimized and legalized because of the pandemic.  “And we’re also spending a lot more time online, which means some of the reporting we used to do face to face, we’re doing it digitally whether through Zoom, which is not end-to-end encrypted, and even just phone calls with sources,” she said.  “Surveillance was already pervasive before the pandemic, but now certain kinds of surveillance are being legitimized and legalized because of the pandemic.” — reporter Gisela Pérez de Acha  Online Work Adds to Threat  Journalists have reported instances of “doxing,” social media harassment in which the identity, address, or other personal details or someone is revealed, and spying in recent weeks. In August 2020, an investigative reporter with Ukraine’s Schemes TV program, Mykhailo Tkach, reported signs of audio surveillance at his home, following warnings from his sources that his reporting had “irritated” senior government officials. (Days later, a car used by Schemes staff was torched.) In July, another Ukrainian investigative reporter, Lyubov Velychko, received threats and abusive messages after she had exposed Russian state control behind Telegram propaganda channels.  But these incidents remain isolated, at least for now. Interviews with a dozen journalists working on the pandemic, combined with a search of news stories and reports from nongovernmental organizations, found no evidence of a general uptick in digital breaches or harassment during the current crisis.  What those interviews did uncover, however, was deep concern that reporters are now more vulnerable than ever to such attacks — and that several leading journalists are either adding extra digital security measures or offline reporting, or both, to their procedures.  The primary concern for these journalists centers on how the lockdown has forced reporters to migrate their working model from face-to-face to digital platforms: that the sheer volume of their work in the digital space has increased the threat that their communication with sources might be intercepted. In many cases, they might never know that breaches happened, according to digital safety specialists.  The heightened hacking threat means that hygiene principles are no longer optional, like using password managers, updating apps, two-factor authentication, and recognizing that phones represent the primary vulnerability.  Experts agree that reporters should not allow the apparent ubiquity of online threats to have a chilling effect on their investigations, by using basic digital hygiene for most investigations, and by upgrading to advanced security and low-tech methods for stories that they pre-identify as high risk. Not every story requires burner phones and end-to-end encryption. But they say the heightened hacking threat posed by pandemic conditions means that — “like flossing your teeth” — certain hygiene principles are no longer optional, like using password managers, always updating apps, using two-factor authentication, and recognizing that phones represent the primary vulnerability.  “Zero-click” Spyware a New Stealth Weapon  The recent cyber attack against Moroccan investigative journalist Omar Radi offers perhaps the most chilling example of the use of new generation technology to hack reporters — and the threat that governments could use the purchase of legitimate COVID-19 contact tracing technology as cover for buying surveillance gear from the same companies.  Radi was given a four month suspended sentence in March for criticizing a judge who upheld a verdict against pro-democracy activists, and has since been detained several times by police.  A forensic investigation by the Amnesty Tech unit at Amnesty International revealed that Radi’s phone had been the focus of a sophisticated “network injection” attack, which redirected the device’s browser to a site that quietly uploaded Pegasus spyware. “NSO Group, the Israeli company marketing its technology in the fight against COVID-19, contributed to a sustained campaign by the government of Morocco to spy on Moroccan journalist Omar Radi,” the report states. “When Pegasus is installed, an attacker has complete access to a phone’s messages, emails, media, microphone, camera, calls, and contacts. Network injection attacks are notoriously difficult for a victim to spot as they leave few clues.” Both NSO and the Moroccan government have denied Amnesty’s findings.  “With this network injection, you don’t even have to click anything. You could just get a missed call.” — Amnesty’s Danna Ingleton.  Most troubling about the new threat is its “zero-click” attribute, says Danna Ingleton, deputy director of Amnesty Tech. “In the past, NSO technologies — particularly Pegasus — would have to send you some sort of socially engineered text message, saying something to get you to click on a link, and that website would then infect your system. But with this network injection, you don’t even have to click anything. You could just get a missed call. You can do everything to keep yourself safe, and still be at risk.”  Ingleton says there is an urgent need for a global moratorium on sales of this kind of software until effective regulations are created to prevent abuses.  “We need journalists to continue to be concerned about their privacy, expose violations of their privacy, and contact organizations like Amnesty to expose and get accountability,” she says.  Assessing Risk for Each Story and Beat  California-based investigative journalist Pérez de Acha suspects that sources in a terrorism story she is investigating could be under surveillance by federal authorities in the United States — and that as a result her own communications may be being monitored.  Having previously used “burner phones” only in developing countries like Mexico, she is now using disposable sim-card numbers, rather than a phone connected to her identity, in the US. “But that’s only because of the nature of the story,” she says. “So I adjust my behavior. To that, you add that because of the pandemic, I can’t see my sources in person. Everything is either digital or through the phone, even though I will push [sources to use] Signal [an encrypted message app]. But it doesn’t always happen.”  Pérez de Acha emphasizes that most investigative stories are not high risk for sophisticated hacks, and that reporters need to use basic threat modelling to assess how much digital protection they need, and not be constrained by paranoia.  “It’s also good to divide surveillance concern per beat — it’s not the same risk reporting on homelessness as on terrorist activities,” she says. “If you’re reporting on healthcare you’re probably fine, just have strong passwords, and don’t be dumb. I’m in Berkeley, so let’s say I’m investigating the Berkeley police. What are the chances they could have a tap on my phone? Well, they’d need a warrant from a judge, or maybe someone from T-Mobile could be a leaking source, or they have advanced tools to hack me. Honestly, for local police, that risk is not that high.”  Pérez de Acha says the pandemic has underlined the importance of preventing professional and personal worlds from merging online.  She says one reporter she knows in California recently filed a public information request for gun ownership data, using his personal details. She says he then received a series of threats to himself and his family — via those personal contact details he had listed on the application — from “alt right” activists that were so serious that he was forced to abandon the investigation.  Fahmida Rashid, a senior reporter at security news site Decipher, says many reporters — including herself — are now using old-school P.O. boxes for document drops, for sources who might not be willing to create encrypted email, like Protonmail.  “We definitely are going to see government overreach in this pandemic, and you have to worry that it’ll stick,” she said. “There is precedent in the US, after 9/11, with the Patriot Act used to force journalists to reveal their sources, all under the name of terrorism investigation.”  Fahmida Rashid says many reporters are now using old school P.O. boxes for document drops, for sources who might not be willing to create encrypted email, like Protonmail.  Rashid says most of her reporter colleagues in Hong Kong and Taiwan are using Telegram and Signal for messaging, rather than WeChat — despite that platform’s ubiquity in the region. China-based WeChat is a frequent target of Chinese government censors and trolls, while Telegram and Signal are encrypted and have records of independence.  Safety Challenge Grows for Freelancers  Perhaps most ominously, malicious actors are beginning to exploit a core journalism strength — curiosity — as a digital vulnerability.  Last year, The Great Saudi Podcast — an investigative series first hosted by exiled Saudi journalist Safa al-Ahmad — received a strange direct message to its Twitter account.  The first season of the podcast dealt with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi — the Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist — and the Twitter message requested a secure email in which to send a video that was said to relate to the murder.  In addition to being an award-winning independent filmmaker — who revealed an uprising in eastern Saudi Arabia in 2015 — Al-Ahmad was a long-time friend of Khashoggi.  “So I was like, ‘OK…’ and then they started saying things like: We have smuggled a video out of the consulate, we have the entire murder on tape, we’ve taken a lot of risks,” Al-Ahmad recalls. “And then they sent screenshots of the alleged video. The person who was managing our account opened the screenshots. The pictures were strange and intriguing, from a journalistic perspective. It showed a dead body on the floor, quite graphic images. The first thing I had to think about was digital security, and I was thinking: ‘We’ve been breached … you need to throw away your phone now.’”  Al-Ahmad says she still doesn’t know the true intent behind the message, although she did find the original of that video, and concluded that it did not show the murder of her friend.  “This is part of what it means to be a Saudi journalist in exile now: absolute paranoia about every digital interaction, constantly, and now, because of COVID-19, increased risk of monitoring.” — reporter Safa al-Ahmad.  However, for Al-Ahmad, the incident echoed a recent pattern in which journalists have been targeted with messages that either piqued their professional curiosity or personal connections.  “This is how other reporters have been hacked with Pegasus. I remember how one reporter was sent a ‘Ministry of Justice alert’ to a court case they were covering,” she says. “It was such a reminder for me of how dangerous digital communications can be for a journalist. This is important, because I’m more cautious than most, and I still could have been [hacked]. As a journalist, I wanted to see that link, that picture. I’ve known Jamal for 20 years; this wasn’t just a story, it was personal for all of us.”  However, Al-Ahmad points out that, as a freelancer, it was only due to her relationship with the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab digital threats research unit that she was able to evaluate the potential threat.  In general, she says the increased surveillance threat presented by pandemic-related regulations and practices presents a particular challenge for freelance journalists, who don’t have institutional support for their digital security.  “This is also part of what it means to be a Saudi journalist in exile now: This absolute paranoia about every digital interaction, constantly, and now, because of COVID-19, there is increased risk of monitoring,” she says. “I can’t just set up a meeting and say: ‘OK, I’ll just ask you what I need to know when I meet you’. Everything has to be digital, or over the phone — and Signal is my best friend during the pandemic. Digital security is paramount right now, and freelancers are extremely vulnerable as a group,” she says.  “We are on the backfoot to staffers, who often get clean laptops and cell phones on assignments. But, as a freelancer, I can’t afford to be constantly having burner phones. I can’t afford to lose the number [my contacts] know to reach me on. The cost of true digital hygiene is impossible for me, so the question is, how can I be as responsible as feasible?”  Al-Ahmad says she was dismayed by the recent revelation that Zoom was vulnerable to hacks for users with older versions of Microsoft Windows.  “I usually agree to do Zoom and then delete it afterwards, but after this news of the [hacking vulnerability on Windows], I don’t even want it on my computer,” she says. ”I mean, the person who is doing the Zoom call — I don’t even know what their computer is. I can’t be asking sources: what’s the spec on your computer? Have you updated it recently?”  “ I’m more cautious than most, and I still could have been [hacked]. As a journalist, I wanted to see that link, that picture. I’ve known Jamal for 20 years; this wasn’t just a story, it was personal for all of us.” — Safa al-Ahmad.  Phones Remain the Prime Spying Target  A more common threat emerging under the various lockdowns implemented worldwide is the use of basic call data by authorities — rather than the content of conversations — as leverage to harass both reporters and their sources.  In Nigeria — prior to the pandemic — police were found to have used call records from reporters’ phone accounts to identify sources from frequently-called numbers.  “The reporters affected in Nigeria were shocked — this was not the type of surveillance they were expecting,” says Jonathan Rozen, senior Africa program researcher for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). “We’re talking about pretty rudimentary call data. Seemingly innocuous information was leveraged quite seriously in order to arrest journalists for their work. The police have access to the reporters call data, which includes most frequently called people, and based on that information, they would contact those people, and in some cases bring them into custody and compel them to summon the targeted journalists.”  Rozen says early signs of added surveillance under the pandemic mean that reporters in Africa, and elsewhere, need to be extra vigilant. In July, Rozen authored a CPJ report which revealed that Ghana’s law enforcement entities had acquired advanced phone hacking technology that has been used elsewhere to target journalists’ cell phone communications.  “There has been a broad concern from journalists since the beginning of the pandemic that states may expand surveillance powers in the context of the lockdown, and have the potential to be abused and leveraged against reporters,” says Rozen.  Extreme digital hygiene procedures could include steps such as unchecking boxes like “Check your spelling as you type,” “Provide search suggestions,” and “Block all cookies” in browser search preferences, to reduce the chances of your search engine reaching out to external nodes. Or avoiding data-hungry browsers like Chrome and Internet Explorer, instead using a privacy-focused search engine like DuckDuckGo. But experts like Pérez de Acha see the limitations of some of these settings as outweighing the low risk of exposure.  Several journalism support organizations have developed general digital security guides for reporters, including the CPJ. After interviews for this story, GIJN is updating its own guidelines. Here are 10 tools and techniques that experts say are particularly effective for the pandemic period, and beyond:  Create a Virtual Burner Phone: Set up Google Voice as a “virtual burner phone.” One striking feature of the interviews we conducted was that the numbers GIJN dialed for several sources was not their personal phone, but a random number assigned by Google Voice. “I think probably only my boyfriend and my mom know my actual number,” notes Perez de Acha. But she warns that Google itself is still vulnerable to legal probes for data.  Get a Protected Browser: Use a well-protected browser like Firefox, and delete unsupported browsers like Internet Explorer from your system.  Use Encrypted Comms: For sensitive stories, ask sources to use end-to-end encrypted communication systems like Protonmail for email and Signal for texting. More familiar encrypted systems like WhatsApp can suffice — but keep in mind that WhatsApp does archive metadata. If that fails, offer sources a P.O. box address for sensitive documents.  Upgrade Windows: If you’re using Windows 7 or an older Windows version on your PC, then avoid using Zoom until you’ve either upgraded to a newer Windows version, or installed a micropatch to fix a security hole in Zoom detected on July 9. Jitsi is a good open source virtual meetings alternative, although its participant numbers are limited.  Separate Personal & Professional: If possible, prevent your professional and personal digital worlds from merging, by using methods including burner social media accounts and encrypted communications. Never use your own address when making access to information requests.  Report Attacks: While there are no current safeguards against “zero-click” spyware attacks — beyond an entirely offline reporting approach — report these attacks to forensic units like the team at Amnesty Tech , and perhaps to your audience as well.  Create “Burner” Accounts: Use “burner” social media accounts — not tied to your personal identity — when passively monitoring extremist or potentially threatening chat groups. But use your professional account, and your status as a journalist, when approaching a potential interviewee identified from those chat groups.  Get a Password Manager: Use a free password manager trusted by journalists, like LastPass , that will generate secure passwords beneath a single master password that you choose.  Use a VPN: Set up a virtual private network (VPN) that encrypts your internet connection — using a trusted system like Tunnel Bear — to help protect your digital privacy.  Use Two-Factor Authentification: Using only a username and password for accounts today is like having only a simple Yale lock and a peephole on your front door during a crime wave. So experts recommend two-factor authentication, which — while briefly annoying — can be easy while following good step-by-step guides, like this one produced by The Verge .  If there is one good pandemic fallout for the press, it may be that security finally becomes a routine practice for journalists doing sensitive work. “I actually think it’s a myth that digital security requires a lot of tech resources, and a lot of money,” says Pérez de Acha. “It can be really easy, and even really fun — you just need to look it up.”  Further Reading  For more information on digital security see GIJN’s Resource Center Guide to Digital Security; this primer on increasing your digital defenses as an investigative journalist; and this GIJN story on how journalists in different regions need to assess their digital security in different ways.

The closest comparable period may be post-World War II, when thousands of soldiers and civilians living with long term injuries were trying, and failing, to access work. At that time, many countries introduced quota systems which required businesses to employ a certain proportion of people with disabilities.  Now we once again stand at a crossroads in terms of building a more diverse workforce. How will countries reinvent themselves to ensure nobody is excluded from accessing work? Could businesses take up the mantle, when they are already facilitating huge changes? How can they introduce a more inclusive approach to employment?    If we assume they will, given the clear benefits, let us look towards the future of diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace in Thailand and globally.  The importance of the ripple effect  According to Max Simpson, Steps with Theera co-founder, what the future holds, should be ""Ultimately, the mission is for us to be out of a job.""    Not necessarily the words every employee wants to hear! Luckily, we are very familiar with the sentiment behind Max's words.  One of Steps with Theera's key aims is to remove the stigma associated with learning differences and create working environments where anyone can thrive.    That's what Max is talking about. Right now, many employers look at people with learning differences and see barriers. Steps with Theera is here to remove those barriers. The day employers look at people with learning differences and see nothing but potential, the work of Steps with Theera is done. The key to reaching this point is visibility, as Max explains:    ""Our theory of change works on the concept that every customer who engages with us, either for products or services, sees our community being capable and working, and changes their perceptions. They may talk to their friends and family about what we do and so on. Bigger than that, an employer or business owner may interact and decide they want to explore being an inclusive employer.""    The more businesses take this step, the greater the ripple effect. There have already been some groundbreaking firsts for Thailand in terms of visibility, including a collaboration between Special Olympics Thailand and the major Japanese clothes retailer Uniqlo which placed disabled athletes in customer facing roles across Thailand. Elsewhere, PTT runs Cafe Amazon for Chance hiring people with disabilities into barista roles.  Tech and grants  It's not just the workforce which has been shaken up by Covid-19, it's the workplace. Businesses have created a more inclusive environment simply by enabling a culture of remote working, as reported by the World Economic Forum. If workers with specific needs are in control of the space they work in, and the tech they use – for example screenreaders - it could reduce pressure on businesses in terms of the level of workplace adaptation needed.    Rob Candelino, CEO/General Manager of Unilever Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia and Singapore, agrees:    ""As we accelerate our transition into more digitised, flexible, and remote ways of working, many of those barriers that have held people with disabilities back will crumble. For the first time in history, we have the chance to fully unleash the potential of this large and talented population and the unfair and inaccurate stigmas that accompany them.""    Tech innovations may also help businesses meet recruitment challenges related to diversity. Platforms like Proabled use skill-matching to connect employers with people with disabilities across the Middle East. Another app aimed at removing barriers to employment for young people is UK based Connectr. They empower candidates by providing digital mentors and a personalised experience, thus allowing for the spectrum of different needs and abilities that candidates may have. With investors in Asia now specifically targeting such projects – for example the Disability Impact Fund – it may not be long before we're seeing similar products launched in Thailand.  Looking to leadership  Prominent business leaders are being urged to engage more with inclusion such as through the ""Valuable 500"" movement, which aims to recruit 500 corporations to help unlock the potential of the 1.3 billion people living with disabilities across the world.  Does this willingness to diversify play out among Thailand's business leaders? ""Unilever is deeply committed to inclusivity in all its forms such as gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs and indeed for those with different abilities or as we call it, 'diff-abilities'. In a post-Covid world we believe we will see significantly more opportunities being unlocked for people who were previously excluded because of physical or developmental differences"" , according to Rob Candelino.    Phuree Smittinet, Project Manager of Café Amazon for Chance, said: "" We have opened nine cafés and employ 62 staff, with over half coming from disadvantaged groups, including those who are deaf and autistic. These experimental cafés have taught me that by providing equitable jobs with advancement opportunities to all our staff, and a little more effort to accommodate operational changes, our customers can enjoy the same experience as they would at other cafés, and we can run our business sustainably. To me, this is the future of all business.""  Avoid taking steps backwards – the impact of Covid-19  Optimism like this from Unilever and Cafe Amazon is encouraging. But now is not the time for complacency as far as Max Simpson is concerned:    ""Prior to COVID, I would have said we were making good progress in Thailand, and globally, in creating more partnerships with employers, better training with industry appropriate skills, and creating awareness.""    ""Now I fear we will be set back as job opportunities and security for the majority are impacted. We saw all of our graduates lose their jobs when COVID hit and only a small percentage have been included in the future plans of their organisations.""  Rising to the challenge  It is difficult to accept that progress made towards diversity in the workplace could be lost, especially when we know it creates happier and more profitable working environments. Economic uncertainty does not need to stop businesses thinking about inclusivity.    Government could hold a key role in encouraging them. In the first article of this series, we outlined some issues with the quotas set out in the Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons Act (1991). We now ask once more whether it's time, while the business world is faced with unavoidable change, for this quota system to be phased out in favour of more innovative schemes to create equal opportunities in Thailand.    Ultimately, the future we should be looking to is one in which those who don't match some rudimentary set of characteristics are no longer categorised, and treated as 'different'. A future where across society, a range of needs, values and abilities are represented and catered to as standard.    This time of crisis could be reframed as an opportunity to steer us towards this future. It remains to be seen whether businesses will act upon it.

Created in Australia in 2015 by Capponi and co-founder Gordon Renouf, the global ethical fashion app makes finding sustainable style options easier.  The app provides brand ratings, articles, and expertise on ethical and sustainable fashion to help consumers shop according to their personal values. The app is fairly easy to navigate: Users simply type in the retailer they’re considering buying from to see how well it ranks (the company uses a scale ranging from “We Avoid” and “Not Good Enough” to “It’s A Start,” “Good,” and “Great”) and get a real-time assessment of the brand's ethical impact. There’s also an option to search by different categories — denim, dresses, shoes — for a comprehensive list of the most eco-friendly options across a range of price points. Users can also suggest new brands for Good on You to add to its assessments.  The Good on You app has become a must-download for ethical shoppers. When it launched in 2015, it quickly gained 10,000 downloads in 10 days. Half a decade later, the platform is now used by 700,000 people across the globe.  Courtesy of Good On You  Capponi says ethical fashion is something to pay attention to. “Often, young people don't really realize that fashion is still made by an individual. There's still someone that is making that garment that's using their hands to sew,” she says. She cites reported incidents in Bangladesh and China as examples of unsafe working conditions in the industry. “Some people assume that it's all automated in factories, but that really isn't the case. There's a person behind every garment,” Capponi shares.  Unfair pay and these dangerous conditions are all too common for millions of garment industry workers around the world, many of whom are women. The excessive use of toxic chemicals, pesticides, and synthetic fibers also makes fashion one of the world’s biggest polluters, producing 20% of global wastewater and 10% of global carbon emissions, according to the United Nations.  To help consumers find brands doing right by the planet, people, and animals, Good on You uses public data, including brand reports, trusted third-party indexes, and eco-conscious accreditation companies to assess how ethical companies are.  Information was completely missing from the market, and people, even if they did care, didn't know where to start.  The work Capponi does at Good on You is inspired by principles she learned when she was young. “My mother’s first job when she landed in Australia at age 15 was in a knitting factory very close to where I now live,” she says. ""My family taught me the values of working hard, of having empathy for people who are less fortunate, and [that] everyone should have fair treatment and equal opportunity. All of that is so entwined in how I came to care about these issues.""  Good on You fills the gap that Capponi herself has tried to close as a longtime lover of sustainable fashion. “When I first started hearing about the shocking conditions for workers in factories and the overproduction that was wreaking havoc on the environment, my initial reaction was to stop buying anything at all and to appreciate what I already had. Even today, my most sustainable purchases are things that I have cherished and held onto for a really long time, like my favorite pair of jeans that I keep repairing over and over again and a vintage coat that my mum handed down to me,” Capponi shares.  Because she knows firsthand how time-consuming researching a brand's business can be, she wanted to create a better, more streamlined system that takes the guesswork out of shopping. “[We] started Good on You because we realized that more and more people were like us. They wanted to make more sustainable [and] ethical choices when they shopped, but it was just too hard. Information was completely missing from the market, and people, even if they did care, didn't know where to start,” Capponi says.  Prior to Good on You, Capponi worked on the corporate social responsibility strategy at National Australia Bank before catching the attention in 2016 of Gordon Renouf, who was already conducting beta testing for the Good on You app in Australia. The concept was appealing to Capponi, who saw an incredible opportunity to help transform the way people shop and how brands do business. “If we could get people to realize that [sustainability] was something consumers cared about and were acting upon, then consumer demand and sentiment would shift business behavior much more rapidly than internal practices and policies,” she explains.  Renouf, in turn, credits Capponi with inspiration that’s at the heart of Good on You’s mission. “Sandra’s totally committed to the vision of an ethical and sustainable world with boundless energy and drive,” he says. “She has a unique ability to look at all sides of an issue or relationship and find the best way through, one that works for everyone involved.”  Courtesy of Good On You  Over the years, Good on You has become a must-download for ethical shoppers. It's even had megastar and actor Emma Watson as its brand ambassador since February 2019. “Many years ago, we joked about getting Emma on board as our ambassador,” Capponi recalls. “And then, actually very unexpectedly, her team reached out to us.” Watson was guest-editing Vogue Australia’s March 2018 sustainability issue, and she wanted Good on You to be the verification partner to check brands. It turned out she was already a longtime user of the app.  The app’s expansive database, with more than 2,000 fashion brands, has a measurable impact on the way thousands of people — movie stars and the rest of us — shop. “Our community contacts us every day, sending us messages like ‘you changed the way I shop’ and ‘thank you for making sustainable shopping so easy for me,’” Capponi says. Good on You’s core demographic, Capponi says, is made up of shoppers who care but don’t necessarily know how to start shopping ethically. “That is the group of people that we love to treat right because we've been able to break down the issues in a really simple way,” she says.  Marielle Elizabeth, an influencer in the slow-fashion space, explains the huge impact an app like Good on You has on shoppers. “It can be a great tool in your tool belt,” Elizabeth says. She explains how the app helps answer questions that are important to consumers. “Is someone paid a living wage? Do they have job security? Are they treated with respect and dignity while they're manufacturing clothing?”  I'd like to see the future of fashion returning to its origin, being something that is … of value and beauty.  And it’s not just consumers that find Good on You helpful. Major retailers like FarFetch — a popular e-tailer for luxury fashion — use its ratings to help shoppers identify which brands are truly doing right by the planet. “Large retailers want to know how their portfolio [of] brands rate on these key social and environmental issues,” Capponi says.  Capponi says to truly protect the planet, the work is twofold: Brands have to reconsider their production practices, and shoppers need to reduce their consumption. “The industry simply needs to produce less and consume less. There is so much waste and harm to people and the planet caused in the fashion industry today. I'd like to see the future of fashion returning to its origin, being something that is … of value and beauty,” she says.  In the middle of the global pandemic, Capponi and Renouf have shifted their focus to addressing the latest shifts in ethical fashion. On Aug. 25, Good on You announced it had updated brand ratings to account for how companies responded to cancellations and other crises due to the pandemic. “Brands that abandoned their workers and canceled factory orders score poorly, whereas brands that protected their workers and suppliers are now rewarded,” Capponi explains. And the work doesn’t stop there. “In our next rating update, we want to look more deeply at how brands are addressing another very important issue — racism. This includes looking at the things they’re doing, the policies and practices they have in place, to make sure all employees of every race feel safe, respected, and empowered,” she says.  As for future steps, Capponi has her eyes set on expanding the platform into other consumer categories. “Beauty, in particular, has many of the same issues and concerns [as the fashion industry] around how people are treated,” she shares. “[By growing Good on You], we can make sustainable choices really easy, and through the power of people's choices, shift change toward a more sustainable future.”"

The Russian announcement came less than two months after the start of human testing of the vaccine. The vaccine only completed its Phase 2 trials. A Phase 3 trial involving tens of thousands of people is normally required before a vaccine can be approved.  After Russia said it had approved a vaccine, the United States, an important partner of Vietnam, expressed disbelief that Russia could have developed a vaccine so quickly. And the World Health Organization (WHO) urged the country to make sure it followed international guidelines in its effort.  The WHO says more than 150 programs are currently researching possible vaccines around the world, including those in China, Australia, Britain and the United States.  Russia’s international relations have suffered elsewhere, from interference in the U.S. presidential election, to its seizure of Ukrainian territory which led to European Union sanctions. But Vietnam’s long history with Russia might help explain their vaccine deal.  Vietnam is one of the last remaining communist nations, which had strong ties to the old Soviet Union. Vietnam’s founder Ho Chi Minh was a student of the ideas of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. Ho and other influential young people from the former French colony of Indochina, now Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, spent formative years in Russia.  Looking at other vaccines  Vietnam was doing its own vaccine research before the Russia announcement. However, the first workable vaccine is likely to come from a nation with many resources. This has led developing nations like Vietnam, Indonesia and India to look for help elsewhere.  The state-run newspaper Tuoi Tre reported that Vietnam could buy 50 million to 150 million doses of the Russian vaccine by 2021. And Vietnam’s health ministry said it has also registered to buy possible vaccines being developed by Britain and the U.S.  “A vaccine that has been used in a foreign country may not require any more tests when it's imported to Vietnam,” said Dr. Tran Dac Phu, a top advisor to the Vietnam Ministry of Health’s Public Health Emergency Operations Center. He spoke on the national VTV station. However, he added, ""its trials must still be applied on humans to test its safety and effectiveness.”  Vietnam has dealt with COVID-19 more aggressively than some of its neighbors. The country intensified the battle against the disease in July when it reported its first COVID death.  Still people need to keep taking safety measures and not put all their hopes on a vaccine, said Vu Duc Dam, the Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam who has been leading the pandemic efforts.  “Because we controlled the disease well for a long time, people have become more negligent,” he said this month. “It’s time to remind ourselves that the pandemic is still going on and the vaccine will only be available to everyone in at least one year. We must strengthen measures to safely live together with the disease.”  I’m Caty Weaver.  VOA News reported this story. Caty Weaver adapted it for Learning English.

Since the early 1990s, Prime Minister Hun Sen’s ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) has worked to carve the country up into small parcels of land available to private companies at bargain basement prices. The country’s 2001 Land Law granted the government the right to issue ELC leases of up to 99 years under the pretext of improving local economies and establishing a thriving agroindustry.  But over the past two decades, Cambodia’s land leasing policy has led to more than a tenth of the country’s land area being leased and has become increasingly controversial because of its negative impact on local livelihoods.  A growing segment of the country’s population of 16.25 million has been pushed below the poverty line as a result of systematic land-grabbing and forced evictions, while the country’s natural resources—particularly its forests—have been destroyed or depleted at an unprecedented scale and pace.  Meas Soksensan, spokesperson for the Ministry of Economy and Finance, recently confirmed to RFA’s Khmer Service that the government leases unused land as ELCs at a rate of merely U.S. $5 per hectare (2.5 acres), drawing an annual revenue of just U.S. $10 million.  “We will surely review those contracts and when our economy is stable and recovers [from the impact of the coronavirus], we will consider whether to increase our revenue from these land leases by hiking up the rental rate based on market value,” he said.  In mid-June, the Ministry of Economy and Finance said it is reviewing ELC contracts issued to 231 companies for more than 1.1 million hectares (2.7 million acres) of land across the country. At the time, the ministry was drafting a new bill on management of state assets—an article of which specifies that all leasing of state assets, including land, should not exceed 50 years. The bill was recently unanimously passed by Hun Sen’s cabinet and is now awaiting introduction to the National Assembly.  Amid growing criticism, Hun Sen has made several revisions to the country’s ELC policy. Most recently, in 2016, he announced that more than 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres) of ELC land had been revoked by the state from the more than 2 million hectares (4.9 million acres) it had granted to private firms, reducing the amount of ELC land to around 1.1 million hectares.  But according to figures compiled by local rights group Licadho in March, Cambodia has so far granted 297 concessions—equivalent to 2.1 million hectares (5.2 million acres) or about 12 percent of the country’s total land area. Of these concessions, Chinese firms control the largest total area at nearly 400,000 hectares (990,000 acres), followed by those from Vietnam at more than 360,000 hectares (890,000 acres).  Licadho said that at least 15 companies, all of which are owned by tycoons and CPP senators, were granted more than 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) of ELC—exceeding the amount permitted by the 2001 Land Law. The companies claim to have invested in rubber, sugar, paper pulp, cassava, and palm oil plantations.  ELC figures exclude other concessions granted by the state, such as those for mining, seaports, airports, industrial zones, and fishing lots, as well as some 38 special economic zones created by the government in 2016. According to Cambodia’s national budget law for 2020, the government plans to increase revenues from all concessions to more than U.S. $50 million this year—an 89 percent jump from a year ago.  Protesters call in Phnom Penh for government authorities to intervene in land-rights disputes, Jan. 13, 2020. RFA  Am Sam Ath, deputy director of the Cambodian rights group Licadho, told RFA that the government hasn’t granted or revoked ELCs in recent years.  “I don’t know if this is due to [the coronavirus outbreak] and past issues of land conflicts, but nonetheless, as a civil society, we remain concerned,” he said.  “We’ve stated clearly in the past that such granting of ELC should be ended so that [the government] can resolve all remaining [land] conflicts.”  Vann Sophat, project coordinator for business and human rights with the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR), told RFA that although the ELC policy has contributed to strengthening the economy and providing jobs for local residents, its negative impacts generally outweigh its benefits.  “There have been physical assaults and threats … such as in Koh Kong where forced evictions have occurred … [as well as] shootings of residents, resulting in injuries and deaths,” he said.  “Basically, [the ELC] has not brought about benefits for affected locals. Instead, residents have mostly become homeless and landless, while others were imprisoned—especially women.”  While exact statistics are difficult to find, U.S. attorney Richard J. Rogers filed a lawsuit with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in October 2014 against Cambodia’s ruling elites for “crimes against humanity” on behalf of the country’s victims of land grabs which said an estimated 770,000 people, or six percent of the total population, had been forcibly displaced in land disputes since 2000.  More than 145,000 people, or 10 percent of the population, had been displaced from the capital Phnom Penh alone over the same period, said the lawsuit, which has yet to be ruled on.  Cambodia’s Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction claimed in late 2019 that it has been trying to resolve around 20,000 land conflict cases since 2016 to reduce the number to around 2,200, and that it plans to resolve all cases by 2023. The ministry also claimed to have successfully registered 80 percent of Cambodia’s 7 million plots of land through its Systematic Land Registration (SLR) scheme, supported by the World Bank, and said registration will be completed by 2021.  However, last month, Interior Minister Sar Kheng made a rare public acknowledgment that many of Cambodia’s land disputes are yet to be settled and that resolving them has been difficult because senior government officials are involved in land grabs throughout the country.  Monks and activists hold a tree-blessing ceremony in Cambodia's Prey Lang forest, Feb. 21, 2019. RFA  The ELC policy has also disproportionately impacted Cambodia’s ecology, with agroindustry development leading to the deforestation of vast tracts of land for the purpose of setting up plantations, as well as illegal logging in areas on concession borders.  Ministry of Environment spokesperson Neth Pheaktra recently told RFA that following reforms in 2016, the ministry now manages 69 natural protected areas totaling around 7.3 million hectares (18 million acres) and employs 1,260 forest rangers who work with local communities to prevent forest crimes.  He acknowledged that forest crimes continue to occur but called them “small-scale” and largely perpetrated by residents of the protected areas.  However, forest activist Heng Sros told RFA that forest crimes regularly occur on a large-scale inside conservation areas due to lax enforcement and systemic corruption among the very officials charged with protecting them.  He estimated that Cambodia had lost up to U.S. $800 million from illegal logging in 2019 alone.  “A number of [protected] areas in Cambodia … are inundated by tycoons and powerful individuals who are involved in running commercial logging for transport to Vietnam,” he said.  “They [are enabled by] rampant corruption, from the local level all the way to the higher echelons.”  A 2017 report by the U.K.-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) estimated that Cambodia’s exports of wood products were valued at some U.S. $8 billion that year, compared to U.S. $7.3 billion a year earlier. It said that around 300,000 cubic meters (10.6 million cubic feet) had been smuggled out of Cambodia to Vietnam in the months from November 2016 to May 2017 alone, generating kickbacks of more than U.S. $13 million.  Rampant timber trafficking in Cambodia led the U.S. Treasury Department to sanction a business tycoon with close ties to Hun Sen named Try Pheap and 11 of his registered entities in late 2019 under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. Treasury cited his establishment of “a large scale illegal logging consortium that relies on the collusion of Cambodian officials, to include purchasing protection from the government, including military protection, for the movement of his illegal products.”  Cheuy Oudom Reaksmey, the director of Cambodia’s Natural Resource Protection Group—which was founded by his father, slain forest activist Chut Wutty—told RFA that only government officials, and the rich and powerful, are capable of committing large-scale logging crimes.  “I believe this is due to law enforcement turning a blind eye to deforestation, but if the present rate of logging persists, the 69 protected areas will sooner or later be devasted,” he said.  “The government should therefore have these tycoons, who are involved in commercial logging, arrested and prosecuted … But Cambodia won’t be able to restore its forest unless we first get rid of corrupt officials inside the government,” he added.  “It all involves the powerful—most of whom are serving in the government.”  An illegally felled old-growth tree in Prey Lang forest, April 22, 2020. Credit: Lovers of the Environment  In June, Ida Theilade of the University of Copenhagen’s Faculty of Science, issued a statement saying that satellite imagery from the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) and Global Land Analysis & Discovery (GLAD) - University of Maryland had shown “Cambodia’s forest loss [was] the 10th highest in the world” at 63,000 hectares (155,680 acres) in 2019. Theilade said the country had lost 26 percent, or 2.3 million hectares (5.7 million acres), of its forest cover since 2000.  Spokesperson for the Ministry of Environment Neth Pheaktra declined to comment on the findings, saying there is no need to respond to “third parties” who do not take part in conservation under his ministry’s cooperation framework.  Speaking to RFA, Theilade called ELCs “one of the main reasons” for forest loss in Cambodia, along with “rampant illegal logging,” which she said authorities regularly “turn a blind eye to”—even when conducted at large scale.  She noted that any forest loss figure above one percent is “serious,” saying it will lead to temperature increases and contribute to climate change that could affect seasonal weather patterns, including the length of Cambodia’s dry and rainy seasons.  “I think this issue is something which is going to affect everyone in Cambodia,” she said, referring to both indigenous populations that rely on the forests for their livelihoods as well as Khmer farmers who require rain for their agriculture.  Theilade urged the government to scale back ELCs and better enforce laws protecting forests from illegal logging on their peripheries, while suggesting that Cambodia could benefit substantially from conservation efforts.  “Cambodia is in a fantastic position to contribute to science because here we have a situation where there is the highest quality of remote sensing and satellite images that can be complemented by data from people on the ground, and that is a very unique situation,” she said.  “I think Cambodia could really attract not only tourists but also research funding, taking advantage of what I call ‘citizens scientists’—the local people who know the forest as their own. If you combine that with remote sensing, you have a very powerful tool to monitor and protect the forest.”  Reported by RFA’s Khmer Service. Translated by Sovannarith Keo.

The Cambodian Appeals Court Wednesday denied a bail request for detained union leader Rong Chhun, citing concerns that he might repeat the actions that led to his arrest if he were released, his lawyer told reporters after the ruling.  Rong Chhun was officially charged with “incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest” under Article 495 of Cambodia’s Penal Code and jailed at Prey Sar Prison in Phnom Penh on Aug 1, a day after his arrest for claiming the government has allowed Vietnam to encroach on farmland along their shared border. His arrest has prompted nearly daily protests.  Defense lawyer Chhoung Chhou Ngy told reporters outside the courthouse in Phnom Penh that his client’s bail request was denied because the court wants to “finish this case while preventing repeated crimes.”  Hem Socheat, another defense lawyer, told RFA’s Khmer Service that the defense team plans to appeal the decision in the Supreme Court, but he did not expect that the higher court would overturn the ruling.  “I don’t have any hope, but this is the procedure. We think even though we don’t have any hope, we will try our best to follow the procedure to advocate for our client,” said Hem Socheat. A Supreme Court decision to uphold the denial of bail would end the process, he said.  “Our client did what was done because he wanted to help the country. Our client has a career and a residence, and he is not a risk to provoke any social problems,” he said.  “I think the Appeals Court’s decision runs contrary to the truth. Rong Chhun did not commit any crime. He is innocent and has been working for the sake of the public,” Hem Socheat said.  Ny Sokha of the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC) told RFA that the Appeals Court’s decision was more likely to cause social issues than Rong Chhun himself.  “If Rong Chhun were released, there would not have been any protests,” he said.  During the hearing Wednesday morning, a group of around 100 people protested outside of the courthouse demanding Rong Chhun’s release.  Phou Sareth, an activist with the Khmer Thavarak youth civic group, told RFA that she was disappointed with the court’s decision. She said she would continue to advocate for the union leader’s release.  “We need Rong Chhun. He is a nationalist. He was unjustly imprisoned. Please release him immediately,” she said.  Three Rong Chhun supporters visited Tuesday  A day before Wednesday’s ruling, a group of Khmer Thavarak activists visited Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison to meet with three activists who were detained after they protested in support of Rong Chhun.  Two of the activists, Hun Vannak and Chhoeun Daravy are also members of Khmer Thavarak, while the third, Sar Kanika is affiliated with the banned opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).  One of the visitors, So Metta, told RFA that she was able to meet with Hun Vannak for less than 10 minutes.  “I told him that we are still strong and will continue our work. He encouraged us to remain steadfast and not to be intimidated,” she said.  So Metta said that Hun Vannak appeared to be mentally strong but had a pale face. The visit was watched by guards, who took notes of the encounter, so So Metta said she was unable to speak freely.  The guards also would not allow the visitors to bring food and books, because the inmates are required to buy expensive food in the jail, she said.  The visitors were able to meet Sar Kanika but were not allowed to see Chhoeun Daravy, because guards said she was in quarantine.  Another visitor, Ngel Hean told RFA that Sar Kanika and Chhoeun Daravy are both detained in the same cell. She said Sar Kanika is in poor health because they share the cell with prisoners detained on drug charges who smoke.  She said that the guards are not allowing Sar Kanika and Chhoeun Daravy out of the jail cell to exercise and they now look pale.  “For 14 days, they won’t let them out. Their health is good, but they are being treated like animals.  Nuth Savana of the Prison General department dismissed Ngel Hean’s claims, telling RFA that prisoners are not allowed to smoke inside their cells, but adding that he would look into the issue. He said the visits were brief as a result of COVID-19 restrictions.  “The restriction has been placed by the Ministry of Health to prevent infections from visitors,” he said.  Am Sam Ath of the local LICADHO rights group told RFA that the prison should allow visitors to talk freely and for a longer duration.  “I think the prison should give the opportunity to the visitors to speak freely with detainees,” he said, noting that lately guards have been increasingly listening in on visits, including when NGOs offer legal advice to prisoners.  Border irregularities  Also on Tuesday, Prime Minister Hun Sen ordered National Border Committee Chairman Var Kimhong to meet with 100 families in Tboung Khmum province who say they lost about 60 hectares (148.2 acres) of their ancestral land when recently placed border posts indicated it was part of Vietnam.  Loy Chhoy, an affected villager, told RFA that he supported Hun Sen’s desire to finalize the border, but wants the government to compensate the villagers for lands that had belonged to them for generations.  “I am happy with the demarcation, but the government needs to return the land to us if it is taken away by the demarcation process. I have not prepared anything for my meeting with Var Kimhong, but I will ask him for land to start a plantation,” said Loy Chhoy.  RFA could not reach Var Kimhong for comment.  Cambodia Watchdog Council (CWC) President Men Nath told RFA that he is concerned that Var Kimhong will do what Hun Sen directs him to do regardless of what the villagers request.  “I ask Var Kimhong when he returns to not say the demarcation has been done correctly because there are many irregularities,” Men Nath said, adding that that the council will likely not accept Var Kimhong’s explanation of the border.  The CNRP’s Um Sam An told RFA that Var Kimhong needs to resolve the villagers’ issue fairly and should not make his visit as show to defend a neighboring country.  “Var Kimhong should not intimidate the villagers and he should give back the 60 hectares of land. If there are irregularities with the border demarcation, it should be redone,” he said.  The CWC, of which Rong Chhun is a member, says that farmers are losing land because Cambodia is demarcating the border based on a 1985 treaty from Vietnam’s 1979-89 occupation of the country following its ouster of the Khmer Rouge regime.  Unresolved border issues between Cambodia and Vietnam, former French colonies from the 1860s to 1954, have sparked incidents in the past, with the construction by Vietnam of military posts in contested areas quickly challenged by Cambodian authorities in Phnom Penh.  A joint communique signed by Cambodia and Vietnam in 1995 stipulates that neither side can make any changes to border markers or allow cross-border cultivation or settlement pending the resolution of outstanding border issues.

FILE PHOTO: A general view of Bangkok Hospital in Bangkok May 19, 2014. REUTERS/ Chaiwat Subprasom/File Photo  Thailand is a major hub for medical tourism, drawing patients from Asia, the Middle East and beyond. In 2019, it recorded 632,000 overseas patients who spent 122 billion baht ($3.9 billion), according to government data.  But restrictions to fight the coronavirus have seen most foreign patients, along with most foreigners in general, kept out since April.  While there is no formal ban on foreign patients - except on anyone seeking treatment for COVID-19 and ailments that would draw on resources to manage the outbreak - they need approval for travel, which can be slow and difficult to get.  Only 172 foreign patients have been allowed in since a first easing of requirements in July, senior health official Tares Krassanairawiwong told Reuters, adding that 740 people had made official requests for entry.  But now more health facilities would be allowed to accept foreigners again, and more are expected to come.  “In phase two, another 100 hospitals and clinics will be approved to receive patients, from 120 today,” Tares said.  But hospital operators say the process has been slow and they have hundreds of overseas patients needing their treatment, some urgently.  “Four of our patients have died because they couldn’t get in,” the chairman of hospital operator Thonburi Healthcare Group Pcl, Boon Vasin, told Reuters.  “It’s a humanitarian issue because some countries don’t have the capacity for advanced procedures,” he said, citing patients needing treatment for heart disease, diabetes and cancer.  Boon said approvals were inconsistent and he urged authorities to clarify and relax the process.  Thailand has had 3,404 confirmed coronavirus infections and 58 deaths and has gone more than three months without a case of domestic transmission.  Tares, who heads the Department of Health Services Support, said the procedures had to ensure safety but he expected the approval process to be faster.  He said he also expected people would be allowed to cross land borders from neighbouring Myanmar and Cambodia, major sources of patients.  ($1 = 31.2100 baht)"

In some areas, the interior fit-out is still underway. Outside, construction vehicles are digging up dirt.  The 215,000 square feet (20,000 square meter) production plant was built in recent months specifically for producing a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech.  CoronaVac, the vaccine candidate from Sinovac, is part of China's push to be at the forefront of rolling out immunizations against the deadly novel coronavirus -- and to demonstrate its scientific prowess.  CoronaVac, a Covid-19 vaccine candidate produced by Sinovac Biotech, is one of the six vaccines worldwide that have entered Phase 3 clinical trials.  Scientists globally are racing to find a way to stop to the virus that has infected more than 23 million people and claimed over 800,000 lives. Six vaccine candidates have started Phase 3 clinical trials -- the last step of testing to prove efficacy and safety before seeking approval from regulators -- and three are Chinese.  CoronaVac's last-stage trials are being rolled out in Brazil and Indonesia with about 11,000 volunteers.  ""If everything goes well, we hope that we can have some results around the end of the year,"" said Helen Yang, director of investor relations at Sinovac, from the CoronaVac production plant in the Chinese capital's Daxing district.  The Nasdaq-listed biotech company began developing its vaccine in late January, less than a week after Wuhan -- the original epicenter of China's coronavirus outbreak -- went into a strict lockdown. Construction of the plant started in March, and Yang said the facility will eventually produce 300 million doses of the vaccine a year, if it is approved by China's National Medical Products Administration.  Engineers work on monkey kidney cells for an experimental Covid-19 vaccine at the Sinovac Biotech facilities in Beijing on April 29.  CoronaVac uses an old-fashioned approach -- employing an inactivated whole virus to prompt the body to develop immunity. The virus is grown under controlled conditions and killed chemically, so it cannot replicate to cause disease when injected into the body. This method has long been proven effective with other viruses, and is still used in polio and flu shots, as well as the rabies vaccine.  A Sinovac spokesperson said the company chose an inactivated vaccine because it was most familiar with this approach.  The US is pushing ahead with a newer type of vaccine made using genetic material from the virus. This type of vaccine is faster to produce, because whole samples of a virus do not have to be cultured, but there is less known about which genetic material to choose from the virus to replicate to induce an strong immune response.  To fast-track the preclinical process -- where researchers develop the vaccine candidate and test it on animals -- Yang said the company had conducted several studies in parallel so it could select the best results.  Sinovac has also been working closely with China's equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration to speed up the approval process. ""Once we complete a certain study, we submit the data ... immediately so they can start to review,"" Yang added.  In May, Sinovac published in the journal Science the results of animal trials, which found that its vaccine induced effective antibodies in mice and rats, as well as primates such as the rhesus macaques. A month later, the company said its Phase 2 trial of 600 volunteers found the vaccine caused the human body to produce antibodies 14 days after vaccination.  But the Phrase 3 trial requires large-scale testing of thousands of participants.  By June, China had largely contained the coronavirus, contending with only small, sporadic outbreaks. China had reported 84,996 Covid-19 cases by Wednesday, with fewer than 2,000 new infections since the start of June -- and more than a third of those were imported, according to the country's National Health Commission (NHC).  Yang said the small number of newly reported Covid-19 cases in China didn't meet the necessary conditions for a Phase 3 trial, so Sinovac reached an agreement with Brazil -- which ranks second in the world for infections, with more than 3.6 million reported cases.  A volunteer receives a COVID-19 vaccine produced by Chinese company Sinovac Biotech at the Sao Lucas Hospital, in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil on August 08, 2020.  In collaboration with the Butantan Institute in São Paulo, a Phase 3 study was launched in late July involving 9,000 volunteers, all health professionals who have worked with Covid-19 patients but haven't been infected with the virus, according to São Paulo officials.  In exchange, Brazil was promised 120 million doses of the vaccine, if the tests found it to be effective.  The tests are ongoing, but Dimas Covas, president of the Butantan Institute, said Wednesday preliminary data shows CoronaVac induced immunity in 97% of the people vaccinated after two doses -- a level he said was ""fundamental to break the chain of transmission of the coronavirus.""  Covas said earlier this month that data on the efficacy of the vaccine could be available by October -- potentially starting the formal approval process in a matter of months. He expects the vaccine to be available to the Brazilian public by January.  ""I am very optimistic. I think it would be a reasonable time frame given the performance so far,"" he said at a public hearing at the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.  This month, Sinovac also rolled out another Phase 3 trial in Indonesia with 1,620 volunteers. Indonesia's state-owned Bio Farma said in a statement Friday that it signed a preliminary agreement with Sinovac for the bulk purchase of 50 million vaccines from November to March 2021, with guaranteed priority access until the end of next year.  A race for vaccine  With the global race for vaccines heating up, Yang down played competition between biotech companies -- saying demand was too huge for a single company to meet.  The real competition, she said, is with the virus.  ""Our speed should be faster than the transmission of the virus instead of competing with others. We like everyone to be successful then there will be enough supply to protect people,"" Yang said.  The two other Chinese vaccines to have started Phase 3 trials are being developed by the state-owned Sinopharm, while a vaccine from the United Kingdom, produced by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca has reached this stage, along with two from the United States, one by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer in collaboration with German company BioNTech, and the other by Moderna.  As it stands, 13 companies in China are working on coronavirus vaccines. Of those, nine vaccine candidates are in human trials -- more than in any other country.  Ivan Hung, an infectious diseases specialist at the Hong Kong University School of Medicine, said vaccination is key for countries like China where strict measures have helped keep the percentage of infected people in the population low.  ""The overall immunity is very low. And so in these places, definitely the way forward is vaccinations,"" he said.  Chinese President Xi Jinping learns about the progress on a candidate coronavirus vaccine during his visit to the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing on March 2, 2020.  Geopolitical implications  Senior US national security officials have warned of alleged Chinese government attempts to steal coronavirus research from American institutions for months. In July, US prosecutors charged two Chinese nationals accused of trying to steal Covid-19 vaccine research on behalf of the government.  China's leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly urged Chinese scientists to accelerate the research and development of coronavirus vaccines. Xiao Yaqing, the country's former top market regulator, told pharmaceutical companies last month to treat coronavirus vaccine development as an ""important political task.""  Xiao has since been appointed the minister of industry and information technology.  Not only would a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine save lives, deliver scientific prestige and represent a tantalizing opportunity for economic recovery, it could also have significant geopolitical implications.  The Chinese government has faced sharp criticism -- most notably from the US -- for its initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Its subsequent ""mask diplomacy"" -- an effort to ship medical supplies to countries grappling with Covid-19 -- has fueled suspicion that it is trying to change the coronavirus narrative.  Winning the vaccine race would present China with an opportunity to shore up its global standing by positioning itself as a leader in fighting the pandemic.  Last month, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he had asked Xi to help the Southeast Asian nation get priority access to a Chinese vaccine.  The number of countries granted such access is growing fast. Besides Brazil and Indonesia, which have been approved for early access from Sinovac, Pakistan -- one of China's closest allies -- will receive early vaccine doses from Sinopharm, if its Phase 3 trials are successful.  In a video summit with African leaders in June, Xi pledged that ""once the development and deployment of Covid-19 vaccine is completed in China, African countries will be among the first to benefit.""  This month, China's ambassador in Afghanistan, Wang Yu, told the Afghanistan Times that ""once China's vaccine is successfully developed and produced, it will be our priority to consider providing the vaccine to Afghan people.""  And on Monday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Beijing would also give priority access to Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam.  ""Emergency use""  Within China, authorities have rolled out coronavirus vaccines for "" emergency use "" before the last-stage trials are finished.  Last weekend, a senior official from the NHC revealed that China has been using an experimental vaccine on people who work in high-risk professions since July, including front line medical professionals and border inspectors.  The vaccine, developed by Sinopharm, is still in Phase 3 trials in the United Arab Emirates, Peru, Morocco and Argentina.  Zheng Zhongwei, director of the Science and Technology Development Center of the NHC, told China's state broadcaster that the ""emergency use"" of a vaccine during a ""major public health incident"" was in accordance with the country's vaccine law.  It comes after the Chinese government approved the use of a different vaccine candidate for the country's military in June.  However, on Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci -- the top US infectious disease expert -- warned against early emergency use authorization, explaining that such a step could damage efforts to develop other vaccines.  ""One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enroll people in their trial,"" he said."

His visit to Cambodia… [+10622 chars]","Advertisement  Last weekend Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi became the first foreign dignitary to embark on an official visit to Cambodia amid the COVID-19 pandemic. His visit to Cambodia, part of a four-country tour, is more than just a normal regional trip undertaken to bolster bilateral diplomatic ties and to reflect solidarity in difficult times. Instead, some contentious regional issues — including the Japan-promoted Free and Open Indo-Pacific concept as well as tensions in the South China Sea — dominated the agenda of Motegi’s visit.  His trip demonstrated that Japan is taking another step further to expand its engagement with Cambodia, one of the most prominent of China’s allies in the region. Besides Cambodia, Motegi’s trip included stops in Laos and Myanmar— countries where Chinese influence also ostensibly has deep roots.  What has prompted Japan to swiftly act now to expand its regional role? Clearly, the growing Chinese aggression in territorial claims in both the East and the South China Seas. In its annual defense review released last month, the Japanese government under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe explicitly raised concern over China’s rapid military modernization as well as directly disparaged China’s relentless unilateral expansion of its territorial claims in both the East and South China Seas while other countries have been locked in a battle against the pandemic.  It should be noticed that the Japanese foreign minister’s regional visit also came just a few weeks after the Japanese government inked a deal to provide Vietnam, another South China Sea claimant, with six patrol ships that will boost Vietnamese military capability. Japan said the deal will contribute to the realization of a free and open Indo-Pacific.  Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter  It’s not only Chinese aggression that matters to Japan at the moment. China’s snowballing sway in assisting other countries with the pandemic also poses a stark concern for Japan. From mask to vaccine diplomacy, Beijing has been deploying all possible tools. In case Beijing does successfully develop a COVID-19 vaccine — something China’s leadership calls “a public good” that will be shared with the rest of the world — Tokyo would find it even more strategically challenging to compete with China. If Japan doesn’t quickly act, it may be far from leading the race.  Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.  Countering Chinese Influence in Cambodia  While in Cambodia, Motegi clearly explained to his Cambodian counterpart, Prak Sokhonn, that it has become more important than ever for the Free and Open Indo-Pacific concept to be further reinforced as the international landscape has been considerably shifting as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Introduced by Abe in 2016, the strategy aims to promote closer cooperation and trade between countries in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East while accentuating the importance of a rule-based international system including freedom of navigation as well as ensuring peace and stability in the region.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, during his courtesy call on Prime Minister Hun Sen, in order to strengthen the Indo-Pacific strategy, Motegi highlighted the Japanese government will continue to support infrastructure projects in Cambodia. That includes the development of Cambodia’s sole deep-water port in Sihanoukville — the province where Chinese investment has been prevalent, from investing in casinos to building hotels and restaurants. The port modernization project is funded by a Japanese government loan of $209 million. Once completed in early 2023, the port is anticipated to be a key trading gateway that strategically boosts Cambodia’s growth.  As of June, however, China remains the largest investor in Sihanoukville. Chinese companies account for a majority of the province’s 194 investment projects under construction between 1994 and 2020, worth a total of $30 billion.  In addition to being the leading investor, China also has been alleged to have established a naval base in the province — a claim that the Cambodian government has repeatedly denied and branded as “a fabrication.”  By asserting the importance of energizing the Indo-Pacific framework, Japan is trying to fortify its position in countering China’s rising influence in Cambodia in particular and in the region in general. And with this in mind, it is critical that Japan do more to support and work with any country that regard its role in the region as vital, as well as any country where Chinese clout is ominously mounting.  There is no doubt that Japan still views Cambodia as an important regional partner. Accordingly, ensuring that Cambodia won’t continue falling further into China’s orbit is one of Tokyo’s principal goals. But Japan supporting the above-mentioned projects might not be enough to contest China in Cambodia. Japan must also do more in expanding investments in Sihanoukville province to keep Chinese influence in check.  As Japan’s strategic partner, Cambodia has so far expressed interest and embraced the Japan-spearheaded Indo-Pacific concept. Phnom Penh believes that the strategy primarily pursues economic prosperity through closer engagement rather than pushing countries involved to take sides — which would risk violating neutrality and undermining inclusive regional cooperation.  As can be seen, in the meantime Cambodia has tried to manifest its determination to promote the ASEAN Indo-Pacific outlook which keeps ASEAN at the center of regional cooperation with ASEAN centrality, the rule-based system, and the principle of non-interference being underscored.

Enhancing Bilateral Defense Ties  With China in mind, Japan will continue to deepen not only diplomatic and economic ties but also defense cooperation with the Southeast Asian region, including Cambodia.  In late June, Japan’s Ministry of Defense announced that it would establish a new post in charge of any affairs in ASEAN as well as the Pacific islands. That signals that upgraded military cooperation with ASEAN countries, including Cambodia, can be expected through several mechanisms including military aid, technical training, as well as military equipment exports.  Advertisement  The Cambodian government is, on the other hand, likely ready to accommodate Japan’s growing military engagement. It should be recalled that Hun Sen himself, during a meeting in February with General Goro Yuasa, chief of staff of Japan’s Ground Self-Defense Force, voiced his interest in seeing increased military cooperation with Japan in the areas of information exchange, counterterrorism, and training. Hun Sen also encouraged the Japanese side to provide more military assistance for the country in demining and emergency response.  However, it remains to be seen how far Japan’s overall military cooperation with ASEAN countries can go as it rests upon the country’s evolving defense policy, which has been confined by a pacifist constitution and other legal limitations. However, Japan perceiving China as a long-term threat will likely push it to take further steps in dealing with the conundrum in its post-war constitution.  Cambodia Needs Japan’s Expanding Role  Motegi’s visit to Cambodia also comes nine days after Cambodia effectively lost 20 percent of its preferential trade treatment under the “Everything But Arms” (EBA) scheme granted by the European Union due to its poor human rights records.  Even though the visit is not primarily connected to recent developments in Cambodia’s domestic affair, it still exhibits that Japan is prepared to do more to engage and assist Cambodia during this difficult time.  Cambodia now apparently needs Japan’s support more than ever due to the fact that its relations with the West — especially the EU and the United States — remain at an all-time low, entailing a long time and genuine effort to reset.  With the EBA trading preferences partially withdrawn, Cambodia anticipates the closure of several factories, leaving several thousand workers out of employment.  Even worse, the country’s economy has already suffered a dire blow due to the pandemic. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Cambodia’s economy is projected to shrink by up to 5.5 percent this year, which could possibly cost between 150,000 to 200,000 workers their jobs.  Cambodia’s future really looks grim. The economic fallout has already driven the country to desperate action in trying to diversify its economy as well as exports.  The Southeast Asian country can, of course, look into Japan’s initiatives, be they multilateral cooperation mechanisms like the Free and Open Indo-Pacific or Japanese initiatives on overseas loans and investments — all of which can offer profound funding in infrastructure advancement and stabilizing economic development in the post-pandemic times.  Moreover, Phnom Penh also appreciates Tokyo’s soft position and constructive engagement. When it comes to fostering ties with Cambodia, it is unquestionable that Japan has always had more leverage compared to China. Japan’s soft power is predominant among Cambodians, enjoying an unmatchable and well-respected reputation.  And Japan remains Cambodia’s largest traditional donor. Tokyo provided more than $2.8 billion in official development assistance to Cambodia, nearly 15 percent of financing from all development partners from 1992 to 2018.

Traditionally, Japan also apparently has more sway over Cambodia in many aspects, even in political matters (despite the fact that Tokyo has been criticized for its silence on the political clampdown and human rights issues in Cambodia). Japan, on the other hand, has persistently backed the process of decentralization and political reforms in Cambodia.  A striking feature is Motegi’s message prior to his visit, in which he reaffirmed Japan’s continuous support for Cambodia’s democratic development with its own characteristics — a concept that appears in contrast with Western countries’ approach to democracy promotion.  Japan’s position in dealing with Cambodia can’t be automatically interpreted as cozying up to Cambodia’s human rights and democracy backtracking. The Japanese approach has customarily been driven by geopolitical factors, and of course Tokyo can also comprehend how such sensitive issues should be handled in sensibly effective and proper ways.

The upcoming fantasy-adventure animated film has only teased gorgeous pieces of concept art until now, but today, we finally got to see the Raya and the Last Dragon first look image in its fully-rendered CG glory. Along with the release of the new image, Disney has announced the casting of Kelly Marie Tran in the lead role of the Southeast Asian warrior princess Raya, making the Star Wars: The Last Jedi star the first Southeast Asian actress to lead a Disney film.  Raya and the Last Dragon First Look  Entertainment Weekly debuted the first look at a fully-rendered Raya and the Last Dragon, and revealed the first news about the casting of Kelly Marie Tran in the lead role. The image shows Raya and her trusty steed Tuk Tuk, which is described as a fuzzy bear meets “an insect version of an armadillo.” Raya and the Last Dragon follows Raya and Tuk Tuk as they leave their Heart Lands home to track down the last dragon to help stop the villainous Druun who threatens the fictional kingdom of Kumandra.  Tran is taking over the role from Canadian actress Cassie Steele, who was initially cast when the animated film was announced last year. But it appears that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the film, which had to “quickly reshuffle” to work remotely with production ramping up in March just as the pandemic hit. However, it seems things have changed for the better, as Tran took over the lead role after an amazing audition that left the film’s directors, Moana co-director Don Hall and Blindspotting filmmaker Carlos López Estrada, in “stunned silence.” Playwright Qui Nguyen is also joining Crazy Rich Asians scribe Adele Lim as co-writer.  Walt Disney Animation Studios’ Chief Creative Officer Jennifer Lee said in a statement to EW:  “As filmmakers, Don and Carlos bring a combination of animation know-how and emotional storytelling to Raya and the Last Dragon, bringing our fantasy adventure to surprising, original, and dynamic heights. They both saw the potential for this film and had a strong vision for the story, especially for our lead character, played by the wonderfully talented Kelly Marie Tran. And no small feat, directors Don and Carlos, writers Qui and Adele, and the entire crew of 400 Disney Animation artists are making this film together, while separated and working from home.”  Despite the challenges of working from home, Hall teased that they’ve managed to create what he calls “the most beautiful animated film I’ve ever seen.” Raya and the Last Dragon‘s concept art certainly promised that, and the first image lives up to that hyperbole. As if the beautiful imagery wasn’t enough to get us excited, the film will be Disney’s first film inspired by Southeast Asian culture, which the filmmakers said they worked hard to accurately represent, drawing influence from Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, and the Philippines through research trips to the countries, collaborations with visual anthropologists, as well as screenwriters Nguyen and Lim’s own experiences.  “To have the artists who represent those cultures in there to be able to give the subtleties of what our families are actually like, what our relationships are actually like, has given a lot of nuances to this great adventure,” Nguyen said.  It helps that Tran is one of the few major Vietnamese actresses working in Hollywood right now, with her casting in Star Wars: The Last Jedi catapulting her into the spotlight. She hasn’t received the roles that she’s deserved since, but playing a Disney “princess” in Raya and the Last Dragon is definitely a start. Tran said of her character:  “She is someone who is technically a princess but I think that what’s really cool about this project, about this character, specifically is that everyone’s trying to flip the narrative on what it means to be a princess. Raya is totally a warrior. When she was a kid, she was excited to get her sword. And she grows up to be a really badass, gritty warrior and can really take care of herself.”  The animation on the film is currently 50% completed, according to Hall, which is pretty impressive considering the creative team has done most of their work remotely amid the pandemic. At this rate, the team will be able to reach the scheduled release date of Raya and the Last Dragon on March 21, 2021."

Thailand is a major hub for medical tourism, drawing patients from Asia, the Middle East and beyond. In 2019, it recorded 632,000 overseas patients who spent 122 billion baht ($3.9 billion), according to government data.  But restrictions to fight the coronavirus have seen most foreign patients, along with most foreigners in general, kept out since April.  While there is no formal ban on foreign patients - except on anyone seeking treatment for COVID-19 and ailments that would draw on resources to manage the outbreak - they need approval for travel, which can be slow and difficult to get.  Only 172 foreign patients have been allowed in since a first easing of requirements in July, senior health official Tares Krassanairawiwong told Reuters, adding that 740 people had made official requests for entry.  But now more health facilities would be allowed to accept foreigners again, and more are expected to come.  ""In phase two, another 100 hospitals and clinics will be approved to receive patients, from 120 today,” Tares said.  But hospital operators say the process has been slow and they have hundreds of overseas patients needing their treatment, some urgently.  ""Four of our patients have died because they couldn’t get in,"" the chairman of hospital operator Thonburi Healthcare Group Pcl, Boon Vasin, told Reuters.  ""It’s a humanitarian issue because some countries don’t have the capacity for advanced procedures,” he said, citing patients needing treatment for heart disease, diabetes and cancer.  Boon said approvals were inconsistent and he urged authorities to clarify and relax the process.  Thailand has had 3,404 confirmed coronavirus infections and 58 deaths and has gone more than three months without a case of domestic transmission.  Story continues  Tares, who heads the Department of Health Services Support, said the procedures had to ensure safety but he expected the approval process to be faster.  He said he also expected people would be allowed to cross land borders from neighbouring Myanmar and Cambodia, major sources of patients.

LIDCs have both been hit hard by external shocks and are suffering severe domestic contractions from the spread of the virus and the lockdown measures to contain it. At the same time, limited resources and weak institutions constrain the capacity of many LIDC governments to support their economies.  Absent a sustained international effort to support low-income developing countries, permanent scars are likely to harm development prospects.  Growth in LIDCs is likely to come to a standstill this year, compared to growth of 5 percent in 2019. Further, absent a sustained international effort to support them, permanent scars are likely to harm development prospects, exacerbate inequality, and threaten to wipe out a decade of progress reducing poverty.  Multiple shocks take a heavy toll  LIDCs entered the COVID-19 crisis in an already vulnerable position—for example, half of them suffered high public debt levels. Since March, LIDCs have been hit by an exceptional confluence of external shocks: a sharp contraction in real exports, lower export prices, especially for oil, less capital and remittances inflows, and reduced tourism receipts.  Take remittances, for example, that exceeded 5 percent of GDP in 30 (out of 59) LIDCs in 2019. Between April and May, they fell by 18 percent in Bangladesh, and by 39 percent in the Kyrgyz Republic, compared to the previous year. The repercussions are likely to be felt widely where remittances are the main source of income for many poor families.  As for the domestic impact, while the pandemic has evolved more slowly in LIDCs than in other parts of the world, it is now inflicting a sizeable toll on economic activity. Many LIDCs acted swiftly to contain the spread. From mid-March, when reported infections were still low, they put in place containment measures including international travel controls, school closures, the cancelation of public events and gathering restrictions.  Mobility—a proxy for domestic economic activity—also declined sharply, and continued to retreat as measures were broadened to include workplace closures, stay-at-home orders, and internal movement restrictions. From late April/early May, containment measures have gradually loosened and mobility has recovered, but has yet to return to pre-crisis levels.  Managing difficult trade-offs with scarce resources  Most LIDCs cannot sustain strict containment measures for long as large segments of the population live at near subsistence levels. Large informal sectors, weak institutional capacity, and incomplete registries of the poor make it difficult to reach the needy. Further, governments have only limited fiscal resources to support them.  Recent surveys conducted across 20 African countries reveal that more than 70 percent of respondents risk running out of food during a lockdown that lasts more than two weeks.  Faced with such constraints, the short but sharp front-loading of containment fulfilled a critical purpose: it flattened the infection curve, while granting time to build up capacity in the health sector. Many LIDCs have followed this path: while they expended less fiscal support to their economies than advanced or emerging market economies, the share of additional spending dedicated to health has been higher.  As broad-based containment becomes difficult to sustain, LIDCs should transition to more targeted measures, including social distancing and contact tracing—Vietnam and Cambodia are good examples. Policy support should focus on supporting the most vulnerable, including the elderly, and on limiting the health crisis’s long-term fallout.  For example, protecting education is critical to ensure that the pandemic does not—as highlighted in a recent Letter to the International Community by a group of eminent persons—“create a COVID generation who loses out on schooling and whose opportunities are permanently damaged.”  Where the necessary infrastructure exists, technology can sometimes be leveraged in innovative ways. For example, to limit the spread of the virus, Rwanda is leveraging its digital finance infrastructure to discourage the use of cash. Togo employs the voter registration database to channel assistance to vulnerable groups.  A decade of progress under threat  Despite the best efforts of LIDC governments, lasting damage seems unavoidable in the absence of more international support. Long-term “scarring”—the permanent loss of productive capacity—is a particularly worrisome prospect.  Scarring has been the legacy of past pandemics: mortality; worse health and education outcomes that depress future earnings; the depletion of savings and assets that force firm closures—especially of small enterprises that lack access to credit—and cause irrecoverable production disruptions; and debt overhangs that depress lending to the private sector. For example, in the aftermath of the 2013 Ebola pandemic, Sierra Leone’s economy never recovered to its pre-crisis growth path.  Scarring would trigger severe setbacks to LIDCs’ development efforts, including undoing the gains in reducing poverty over the last 7 to 10 years, and exacerbating inequality, including gender inequality. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will thus be even more difficult to achieve.  LIDCs cannot make it alone  The support of the international community is key to enable LIDCs to tackle the pandemic and recover strongly. Priorities include: (1) guaranteeing essential health supplies, including cures and vaccines when they are discovered; (2) protecting critical supply chains, especially for food and medicines; (3) avoiding protectionist measures; (4) ensuring that developing economies can finance critical spending through grants and concessional financing; (5) ensuring that LIDCs’ international liquidity needs are met, which requires International Financial Institutions to be resourced adequately; (6) reprofiling and restructuring debt to restore sustainability where needed, which, in many cases, may require relief beyond the G20/Debt Service Suspension Initiative; and (7) keeping sight of the United Nations’ SDGs, including by reassessing needs when the crisis subsides.  The COVID-19 pandemic will be defeated only when it and its socioeconomic consequences are overcome everywhere. Urgent action by the international community can save lives and livelihoods in LIDCs. The International Monetary Fund is doing its share: among other things, the IMF has provided emergency financing to 42 LIDCs since April. It stands ready to provide more support and help design longer-term economic programs for a sustainable recovery.  This blog draws on joint work with Rahul Giri, Saad Quayyum, and Xin Tang, and has benefited from the assistance of Carine Meyimdjui."

We therefore also endorse and echo the call made to the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) in a Joint Civil Society Statement on August 13, 2020, to scrap the draft law.  We acknowledge and commend the RGC for taking positive action to tackle gender inequality through a number of comprehensive policy initiatives, including the upcoming Third National Action Plan to prevent Violence Against Women (NAPVAW III), and the Fifth Strategic Plan for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women in Cambodia (Neary Rattanak V). However, we are disturbed by the DLPO’s potential to subject women to criminal sanctions for dress and behavior that allegedly violate arbitrary and discriminatory social norms related to women’s dress and conduct.  We wish to emphasize that the government cannot uphold its commitment to achieving gender equality on one hand, while demonizing and criminalizing women who they deem to be harming society by not conforming to arbitrary, conservative standards of dress and morality. Similarly, the RGC cannot tackle high rates of sexual violence and harassment without promoting women as being in control of their bodies and entitled to their own sexual autonomy, and without condemning and prosecuting perpetrators of all forms of sexual violence. Such recommendations were recently set out by the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) Committee in their 2019 Concluding Observations, in particular paragraphs 11(e), 24(a); 25).  The proposed legislation undermines women’s capacity to enjoy their rights in two main ways:  Firstly, the DPLO restricts women’s right to freedom of expression and reinforces harmful gender stereotypes. The DLPO denies women the right to choose their own attire, alleging that “revealing” clothes have an “adverse effect” on “national tradition and dignity.” While the law does also seek to restrict men’s clothing choices, it is evident from Cambodia’s socio-legal context, and in light of the recent threats against and arrests of Cambodian women for dressing in revealing clothes while selling products online, that this law is likely to applied against women more than men. Such acts of discriminatory prosecution constitute clear violations of women’s right to freedom of expression enshrined in article 31 and 45 of Cambodia’s Constitution and articles 2 and 5 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) that Cambodia has ratified. The DPLO would entrench in law sexist attitudes about women’s dress and conduct and give legal authority to abusive social policing of women’s bodies and choices and a broader culture of discriminatory gender norms. In a similar vein, the DLPO is also likely to be disproportionately applied against members of the LGTBQ community, in particular against performance artists such as drag queens, contemporary dancers and fashion models.  Secondly, the DLPO discriminates against at-risk groups in society, in particular women. The DPLO disproportionately criminalizes domestic, social and economic activities mainly conducted by Cambodian women. The workforce in the informal sector is largely made up of women, including sex workers and street vendors – professions that will be subjected to prohibitions and penalties. While the DLPO does not single out women and girls in this regard, the DLPO will de facto have more adverse and disproportionate impacts on women than men as well as their ability to enjoy a wide range of human rights as set out in international human rights law, including CEDAW and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and Law on the Protection and the Promotion of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Adding to a Joint Statement signed by 79 civil society groups and released on August 13, 2020, we would like to highlight our gender-specific concerns regarding the DLPO:  Article 1 claims the law’s aim is to “ensure public order management by maintaining order, aesthetic value, sanitation, cleanliness of the environment, quietness, social stability, preservation of national tradition, and the dignity of citizens.” We are deeply concerned that the law seeks to restrict women’s freedoms on the basis of vague and subjective criteria such as “national tradition and dignity,” “aesthetic value,” “quietness,” and “social stability,” none of which are legitimate restrictions on human rights under international human rights law.  Articles 9 and 11, regulating competence of authorities and physical appearance, are likely to disproportionately affect sex workers and entertainment workers, and workers in the informal sector, particularly street vendors. These jobs are mostly filled by women who use and solicit in public spaces to earn an income. The restrictions by the DLPO would severely restrict women’s ability to and right to work. Moreover, the law would give local authorities the power to temporarily confiscate possessions as evidence of alleged offenses if the concerned person is unable to pay a fine. These articles also place the burden of maintaining order on individual citizens rather than requiring the government to fulfill their responsibility to provide enough accessible, safe, and good quality public toilets, trash bins and sufficient staff/contractors to clean public spaces and collect trash.  Article 16 has the potential to further harm survivors of domestic violence by making it more difficult for them to seek help and potentially criminalizing them. The provision lists speaking loudly or shouting as a problem of public order, and defines “public space” so broadly that it can include private homes if noises coming from inside can be heard from the outside. This creates the risk that authorities could wrongfully categorize calls for help, or shouts against abuse, as a public order issue instead of domestic violence under the Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Protection of Victims. This could also potentially harm women experiencing violence and seeking help because police could claim legal grounds to punish them for breaking the DLPO, without addressing the violence they are facing.  Article 20 bans “entering into other’s houses, buildings, public and private institutions wearing facial masks or other ways to hide his or her identity.” This provision violates the rights of women who wear niqab as part of their observation of religious beliefs, while also posing health risks during a pandemic such as Covid-19.  Article 25 not only discriminates against those with mental disabilities, but would also disproportionately impact women, who in Cambodia are usually responsible for providing primary care to persons living with disabilities, by requiring them to prevent people with mental health conditions from walking freely.  Article 29 could affect women and children who need to live on-site in the construction areas if the separate law on construction management fails to properly consider the housing needs of women and children at the construction site.  Article 36 prohibits women from wearing clothes that are “too short” or “too revealing.” This provision violates women’s freedom of expression, undermines personal autonomy, and exacerbates discrimination against women who already face gender stereotypes and entrenched societal norms. The RGC has an obligation to respect, protect and ensure every individual’s right to express their identity, and must create an environment in which every person can make such choices about their clothing free of coercion. State interpretations of religion, culture or tradition cannot justify imposing rules about dress on those who choose to dress differently, be it offline or online. Women in Cambodia have frequently been subjected to threats and imprisonment for their choice of clothing. For example, harassment and rape are often blamed on a survivor having ‘provoked’ the perpetrator through her clothing or conduct, and there is little focus on punishing perpetrators of street harassment or sexual violence against women and girls. Article 36 can be used to harmfully criminalize survivors of sexual violence instead of taking meaningful steps to prevent gender-based violence and investigate and punish perpetrators. The DLPO also can perpetuate misunderstandings about the root causes of violence against women and girls in Cambodia. Moreover, article 36 is not necessary because Cambodia’s criminal code already penalizes “public indecency” (article 249). Finally, article 36 fails to define subjective terms contained in the draft, thus opening the door to unequal enforcement and potential law enforcement corruption.  Article 37 restricts freedom of expression – both online and offline – and expands the power of authorities to control social media communications of cis- and transgender women, whom authorities have already punished for online selling based on allegations of having violated arbitrary norms of sexuality.  In concluding this statement, we urge the RGC to uphold all of its international human rights treaty obligations under international human rights law. Article 5 of the CEDAW requires Cambodia to take all appropriate measures to “modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for women and men.” We call upon the RGC to implement the CEDAW Committee’s 2019 Concluding Observations, including in particular paragraphs 11C, 24(a) and 25, which, among others, which requires the government to “systematically assess the impact of measures adopted to combat gender-based violence against women and girls, and continue to explore and adopt innovative approaches to address the root causes of such violence.” Moreover, in its Concluding Observations, Paragraph 9(b), the CEDAW Committee recommended that RGC “systematically undertake gender impact assessments when adopting or revising laws, and ensure that legislative changes help to promote and protect the rights of women.” The current draft language of the DLPO indicates that the Cambodian government has so far failed to conduct such an assessment of the DLPO’s likely negative impact on women, and the degradation and endangerment of the rights of women, contrary to Cambodia’s obligations under the CEDAW.  We therefore call on the Cambodian government to immediately discard the DLPO. The government should instead make it an urgent priority to address the forms of gender discrimination it has identified—including gender-based violence and discrimination in education, economic, social and political participation—through legislative reforms and policy change.

Expressing hope for a green lane such as that set up by Malaysia and Singapore, group chief executive officer Tan Sri Tony Fernandes said as the number of COVID-19 cases has reduced, it is an opportunity for other countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to slowly and carefully relook at opening their borders, without too much risk.  “If you look at Thailand, which has less than 10 cases a day, why can’t Malaysia and Thailand have a green lane?  “I hope even eventually high risk areas are open because there’s good testing regime in place,” he told reporters after launching AirAsia Shop here, today.  Fernandes expected that there would be no international travel until the end of this year, but AirAsia is always prepared for any decision taken by the government including border reopening.  He also hoped AirAsia would not have to undergo another downsizing as travel demand would likely normalise by January next year.  “A lot of factors to think of, we’ll have to wait and see.  “The reality right now is that no one is ready to open up, but let’s take that step (reopen borders). It took a long time for us to be out of lockdown, so it is a small next step,” he said. ― Bernama via Malay Mail  Related reading"

The image posted above gives us our first fully rendered CG image from the film. The still features Raya and her dependable steed Tuk Tuk, a creature that one of the film's directors, Don Hall, describes as a fuzzy bear meets “an insect version of an armadillo.” The upcoming animated adventure takes place in a realm known as Lumandra, a re-imagined Earth inhabited by an ancient civilization, where a warrior named Raya is determined to find the last dragon.  Voicing Raya for the film is Star Wars veteran Kelly Marie Tran, who took over the part from Cassie Steele. Also starring in the fantasy-fueled feature is Awkwafina, who will provide the voice of Sisu, a dragon in human form who needs Raya’s help to reclaim her power and become her true dragon self.  Hall will direct the film alongside Carlo López Estrada from a screenplay penned by playwright Qui Nguyen and CRAZY RICH ASIANS screenwriter Adele Lim. Paul Briggs and John Ripa will also act as co-directors.  “As filmmakers, Don and Carlos bring a combination of animation know-how and emotional storytelling to Raya and the Last Dragon, bringing our fantasy adventure to surprising, original, and dynamic heights,” Walt Disney Animation Studios’ Chief Creative Officer Jennifer Lee told EW in a statement. “They both saw the potential for this film and had a strong vision for the story, especially for our lead character, played by the wonderfully talented Kelly Marie Tran. And no small feat, directors Don and Carlos, writers Qui and Adele, and the entire crew of 400 Disney Animation artists are making this film together, while separated and working from home.”  As a part of many firsts for the company, RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON will be Animation Studios’ first movie inspired by Southeast Asia. Moreover, Tran will serve as the first South Asian actress to headline an animated film hailing from the House of Mouse. In talking about Tran's audition for the part of Raya, the BLINDSPOTTING director (López Estrada) said that it was a moment that won't soon be forgotten.  “I'm never going to forget it,” López Estrada gushed while speaking with EW. “I think [Don and I] rode in the car together, and we were quiet, looking at each other and nodding our heads just being like, ‘Yep, yep, yep. Kelly's perfect.’” López Estrada then added, “she is Raya — just her buoyancy and her positivity, but yet there's a strength as well to Kelly and the character.”  López Estrada also shared that after being so taken with Tran's energy and audition that they changed a scene to match her level of performance.  “We had this little dramatic moment; it was written as a few lines. And I remember her going, ‘Hey, I have some ideas because this is normally how I would say this or I have some questions. Do you mind if I tried it a little bit differently?’” the director recalls. “She went for it, improvised for a minute, and had us all in tears. We changed the scene and reblocked the animation so that it would follow what Kelly did that day because she just clicked on something that was so much bigger than anything we had imagined.”  For more about the magic of RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON, including how the film aims to celebrate cultures that inspire from places like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, be sure to check out EW's full report.  Disney's RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON is scheduled for a March 12, 2021 release, though like any other film making an attempt to hit theaters during the COVID-19 pandemic, that date is subject to change."

It’s also been announced that Star Wars actress Kelly Marie Tran has been cast in the lead role.  The movie was developed from remote locations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and according to director Don Hall (Winnie the Pooh, Big Hero Six, Moana), it’s “the most beautiful animated film I've ever seen.” Hall is directing the film alongside Carlos López Estrada (Blindspotting). The script of which comes from playwright Qui Nguyen and Crazy Rich Asians scribe Adele Lim. Paul Briggs and John Ripa serve as co-directors.  The photo, which comes from EW, features the main character Raya (Tran) along with her trusty steed Tuk Tuk, a creature that Hall describes as a “fuzzy bear meets an insect version of an armadillo.”  The story for the film centers on an evil force that “threatens the fictional kingdom of Kumandra,” and the two characters “must leave their Heart Lands home and track down the last dragon to help stop the villainous Druun.”  Awkwafina also stars in the film and will be playing Sisu, “a dragon in human form who needs Raya’s help to reclaim her power and become her true dragon self.”  Walt Disney Animation Studios’ Chief Creative Officer Jennifer Lee talked about the creative team developing the project saying:  “As filmmakers, Don and Carlos bring a combination of animation know-how and emotional storytelling to Raya and the Last Dragon, bringing our fantasy adventure to surprising, original, and dynamic heights. They both saw the potential for this film and had a strong vision for the story, especially for our lead character, played by the wonderfully talented Kelly Marie Tran. And no small feat, directors Don and Carlos, writers Qui and Adele, and the entire crew of 400 Disney Animation artists are making this film together, while separated and working from home.”  When talking about Tran taking on the lead role, Hall said, “she is Raya — just her buoyancy and her positivity, but yet there's a strength as well to Kelly and the character.” They went on to praise her comedy ability with ad-libs, but it “was the level of emotion she brought to the role that really surprised them.” When talking about that, López Estrada shared:  “We had this little dramatic moment; it was written as a few lines. And I remember her going, ‘Hey, I have some ideas because this is normally how I would say this or I have some questions. Do you mind if I tried it a little bit differently?’ She went for it, improvised for a minute, and had us all in tears. We changed the scene and reblocked the animation so that it would follow what Kelly did that day because she just clicked on something that was so much bigger than anything we had imagined.”  Tran also opened up about the character she plays in the film and teases what we can look forward to seeing, such as some cool fight scenes, and more “high-octane” action:  “She is someone who is technically a princess but I think that what's really cool about this project, about this character, specifically is that everyone's trying to flip the narrative on what it means to be a princess. Raya is totally a warrior. When she was a kid, she was excited to get her sword. And she grows up to be a really badass, gritty warrior and can really take care of herself.”  When creating the film, it was important to the filmmakers to accurately celebrate the cultures that influenced the story, including Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. They put in a lot of effort to get all of the details of these cultures right, and in regard to that Qui Nguyen said, “To be able to have some [heroes] that look like me and my kids, it's gonna matter to a lot of folks.”  The film is 50 percent complete at this point, and López Estrada went on to talk about how Raya mirrors the current state of the world saying:  “I don’t know if Disney has ever made a movie that reflects so much what is happening with the world outside. Even though our team has been working on this movie for years and years and years, it's going to feel like an idea that we had maybe a month ago because it talks so much about the themes and the questions and the hope that's happening today and also the lack of hope, and this wrestling with all these really, really important emotions that are happening right now.”  Raya and the Last Dragon is set to premiere March 12th, 2021."

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership “remains open for India given that not only had it participated in the RCEP negotiations since they were launched in 2012 but also in recognition of the potential of India to contribute to the region’s prosperity,” said a joint statement.  The ministers released the document after a videoconference held in the absence of India. They welcomed “the significant progress” made toward finalizing the deal for signing at the summit of RCEP leaders in November 2020, the statement said.  With the novel coronavirus pandemic disrupting global supply chains and hitting regional economies, the ministers also “underscored the significant role that the RCEP agreement could play in post-pandemic recovery efforts as well as in contributing to the growth and stability of the regional and global economy,” it said.  The outlook for the RCEP deal remains unclear after India, which is concerned that opening up its market would cause its trade deficit with China to grow, said last November it will no longer participate in the negotiations and skipped subsequent working-level talks.  “There were no discussions today about (the scenario for signing a deal) with or without India,” a Japanese official of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, who attended the talks, told reporters. “We confirmed that each country will make its own efforts in getting India back to the talks.”  Besides India, 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand are taking part in the talks, which have a record of failed deadlines for signing a deal.  ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.  The RCEP deal aims to establish common rules for e-commerce, trade and intellectual property. It will cover a third of the global economy and half the world’s population, if India is included."

Eligible for support are Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu in the Pacific and Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Timor-Leste and Vietnam in Southeast Asia.  The program would address the acute phase of the pandemic, providing doses for up to 20 percent of countries’ populations in its first phase, ensuring that healthcare workers and vulnerable groups such as the elderly have access, the release said.  China said on Monday that Vietnam and other Mekong countries would receive priority once it develops a Covid-19 vaccine.  Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam are first in line to get it, Premier Li Keqiang told the third Lancang-Mekong Cooperation leaders' meeting, according to Chinese media reports.  Earlier this month Vietnam's Ministry of Health said it has registered to buy Covid-19 vaccines from Russia and the U.K. It is also registering with other vaccine producers around the world and seeking assistance to produce its own.  Vietnamese laboratories are working hard to get a Covid-19 vaccine ready for clinical trial by the end of this year, and start production in 2021.

But Germany is determined not to close schools anew, so they're sending individual students or classes into quarantine instead. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File)  PARIS (AP) — The U.N. says it’s urgent to get kids back to schools after months-long coronavirus lockdowns, but with the virus still raging in parts of the United States and resurging in countries from South Korea to France, Spain and Britain, medical authorities are urging caution.  Governments are taking different strategies toward the new school year, depending on how many infections they’re seeing, the state of their health care systems and political considerations. Here’s a look at how some countries are handling reopening schools amid the pandemic:  ADVERTISEMENT  UNITED STATES  In the United States, where K-12 education is largely the responsibility of states and local school districts, President Donald Trump and his education secretary have urged schools to reopen in person. But there has been heated public debate over the wisdom of bringing students back to the classroom, especially in communities with high daily new infections, so school reopening plans in the U.S. vary widely. Most of the largest urban districts are starting the year remotely after a summer surge in virus cases. But other districts plan to offer face-to-face instruction at least part of the time. Some have already had to quarantine classrooms or shut down entire schools because of spreading COVID-19 infections.  AFRICA  Only six African countries have fully opened schools. In South Africa, students started returning to class this week class by class. It’s the second time schools are reopening, after an initial reopening resulted in new infections and prompted new closures. As daily COVID-19 cases are decreasing, the government has said all grades should be back in schools by Monday. The South African government has also allowed parents who don’t want their children to return to school to apply for home schooling. Elsewhere in Africa, Kenya has closed its schools for the rest of 2020. In Uganda, the government is procuring radios for rural villages to help poor families with remote learning.  JAPAN  Some schools in Japan reopened Monday after a shorter-than-usual summer vacation to make up for missed classes earlier due to the pandemic. At an elementary school in Tokyo, mask-wearing children held a opening ceremony in classrooms instead of the school gym for better social distancing.  CHINA  As of last month, 208 million Chinese students, or roughly 75% of the country’s total had returned to class, many on some type of staggered class schedule. The rest are expected to return by Sept. 1.  ADVERTISEMENT  PHILIPPINES  The Philippines has repeatedly postponed reopening schools, which are now scheduled to reopen Oct. 5. Even then, only remote-learning classes will be allowed. President Rodrigo Duterte says face-to-face classes should resume only when a COVID-19 vaccine is available.  SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA  Schools remain shut in India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In Sri Lanka, where the government says the virus has been contained to two clusters, schools were allowed to partially open this month for several grades facing government examinations shortly. Schools throughout Cambodia remain closed, while those in Thailand and Malaysia all reopened in July and August. Indonesian schools reopened in July with half-capacity classes and limited hours.  FRANCE  France is sending its 12.9 million students back to classrooms on Tuesday despite a sharp increase in infections in recent weeks. President Emmanuel Macron’s government wants to bridge inequalities for children that were worsened by the coronavirus lockdown and get more parents back to work. All teachers, middle school and high school students will have to wear masks all day, and schools will have one-way corridors and limited gatherings. Cafeterias will reopen to help children who rely on state-subsidized hot meals. The Paris region is giving out free laptops in case children are sent back into a lockdown.  GERMANY  Most German students are already back in school — and at least 41 of Berlin’s 825 schools have reported virus cases. Thousands of students have been quarantined around the country after outbreaks that some doctors attribute to family gatherings and travel during summer vacations. But Germany is determined not to close schools anew, so they’re sending individual students or classes into quarantine instead. Mask and other rules vary state-to-state. In Berlin children can take masks off during class; some states require masks all the time. The government says keeping schools open is more important than bringing fans back to sports stadiums or allowing big crowds for concerts.  BRITAIN  Most of the U.K.’s 11 million students haven’t seen a classroom since March, but children are to start returning to schools across England on Sept. 4. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called reopening schools a “moral duty,” and his government even threatened to fine parents who keep their kids at home. Among measures in place are hand-washing stations and staggered starts and lunch times, but masks aren’t generally required. Some high schools are mulling a hybrid mix of physical and online classes but the goal is to go back in person. Britain has more than 41,500 virus-related deaths, the highest confirmed toll in Europe, and Johnson’s government has been strongly criticized for its handling of the pandemic.  SPAIN  Amid new infections and increasing anxiety from parents and criticism from teachers’ unions, Spanish officials are adapting their plans before schools start reopening Sept. 4. They’re hiring 11,000 additional teachers, building makeshift classrooms in schoolyards to gain space and creating “bubbles” of students who are allowed to mix with each other but not with outsiders. Authorities are facing the added pressure of wanting to reactivate the economy in a country with relatively high child poverty rates. Save the Children is asking for electronic devices to be distributed to disadvantaged families. Teachers’ unions are calling for strikes. Madrid plans in-person classes for all students under 12, and a mix of online and in-class teaching for older students.  NORDIC COUNTRIES  Most schools resumed class last week in the Nordics, as they did at the end of the spring term, amid a general consensus that there is more harm for kids staying home than the risk of sending them to school. Sweden has few virus measures other than banning parents from entering schools when they drop children off. High school students even protested after Denmark’s second-largest city shut their schools because of new infections, saying they don’t learn as much remotely and questioning why they can go to shopping malls, gyms or the movies with lots of others but not school.  —-  Michael Rubinkam in Pennsylvania, Mogomotsi Magome in Johannesburg, Rodney Muhumuza in Kampala, Uganda, Jim Gomez in Manila, Nick Perry in Christchurch, New Zealand, Bharatha Mallawarachi in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, Kristen Grieshaber in Berlin, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Pan Pylas in London contributed."

In 2019, it recorded 632,000 overseas patients who spent 122 billion baht ($3.9 billion), according to government data.  But restrictions to fight the coronavirus have seen most foreign patients, along with most foreigners in general, kept out since April.  While there is no formal ban on foreign patients - except on anyone seeking treatment for COVID-19 and ailments that would draw on resources to manage the outbreak - they need approval for travel, which can be slow and difficult to get.  Only 172 foreign patients have been allowed in since a first easing of requirements in July, senior health official Tares Krassanairawiwong told Reuters, adding that 740 people had made official requests for entry.  But now more health facilities would be allowed to accept foreigners again, and more are expected to come.  ""In phase two, another 100 hospitals and clinics will be approved to receive patients, from 120 today,” Tares said.  But hospital operators say the process has been slow and they have hundreds of overseas patients needing their treatment, some urgently.  ""Four of our patients have died because they couldn’t get in,"" the chairman of hospital operator Thonburi Healthcare Group Pcl, Boon Vasin, told Reuters.  ""It’s a humanitarian issue because some countries don’t have the capacity for advanced procedures,” he said, citing patients needing treatment for heart disease, diabetes and cancer.  Boon said approvals were inconsistent and he urged authorities to clarify and relax the process.  Thailand has had 3,404 confirmed coronavirus infections and 58 deaths and has gone more than three months without a case of domestic transmission.  Tares, who heads the Department of Health Services Support, said the procedures had to ensure safety but he expected the approval process to be faster.  He said he also expected people would be allowed to cross land borders from neighbouring Myanmar and Cambodia, major sources of patients.

Disney also gave a first look at the movie about a computer-generated Raya and her trusted steed Tuk Tuk, whom the creators describe as ""a fuzzy bear meets an insect version of an armadillo.""  Tran takes over the role from Canadian actress Cassie Steele. The film is directed by Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada, with playwright Qui Nguyen and Adele Lim on board as the writers.  ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" is set in the kingdom of Kumandra, where dragons and humans lived in harmony until Druun monsters invaded and forced the dragons to sacrifice themselves for humanity. The film follows Raya — part princess, part warrior — and her journey to find the last dragon to save Kumandra from evil forces.  Awkwafina will star alongside Tran as Sisu, a dragon in human form who needs Raya's help to reclaim her power and become her true dragon self.  Tran makes history as the first actress of Southeast Asian descent to lead a Walt Disney Animation Studios movie.  The creators and the studio wanted to accurately portray the Southeast Asian cultures they are picking up from, including countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines. A Disney Animations rep said it formed a group called Raya Southeast Asia Story Trust, similar to the Oceanic Story Trust that was formed for ""Moana,"" which includes anthropologists, linguists, dancers and gamelan musicians from Indonesia, among others. Production designers and other creatives also went to Southeast Asian regions to look at the designs.  Tran is best known for her role as Rose Tico in ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (2017) and ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" (2019). Since the release of ""The Last Jedi,"" she has been subject to much massive trolling and many racist insults on social media, and she deleted her Instagram profile in June 2018 following constant criticism in the comments over her race.  Prominent personalities, including her ""Star Wars"" co-stars Mark Hamill and John Boyega, came to her defense, along with several fans.  In August 2018, Tran wrote an op-ed for The New York Times about how she started believing the harassing comments.  ""As much as I hate to admit it, I started blaming myself. I thought, 'Oh, maybe if I was thinner' or 'Maybe if I grow out my hair' and, worst of all, 'Maybe if I wasn't Asian.' For months, I went down a spiral of self-hate, into the darkest recesses of my mind, places where I tore myself apart, where I put their words above my own self-worth. And it was then that I realized I had been lied to,"" she wrote.  Now fans are celebrating Tran's evolution into a Disney princess on social media.  Comedian and writer Jenny Yang said in a tweet that she is ""proud of my talented friend."" Director Tze Chun applauded Tran as the first Southeast Asian Disney lead.  The film was ramping up production when the coronavirus pandemic hit, but the cast and 400 members of the crew — including Hall, López Estrada, Nguyen and Lim — have been working remotely during the year. The film is 50 percent animated already, Hall, the director, said in an interview with EW.  ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" is scheduled to release March 12."

For those under 1 year old, the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of the JE neutralizing antibody was 9.49 at birth and significantly declined as the age of month increased (r = -0.225, P<0.001). For those above 1-year old, seropositive proportions were higher in subjects aged 1–3 years old as well as ≥25 years old (65%-75%), and relatively lower in subjects aged between 4–25 years old (22%-55%). Four or more years after the 2 nd dose of JEV-L (first dose administered at 8 months and the second at 2 years of age), the seropositive proportion decreased to 32.5%, and GMTs decreased to 8.08. A total of 87,201 mosquitoes were collected from livestock sheds in 6 surveillance sites during 2015–2018, from which 139 E gene sequences were successfully amplified. The annual infection rate according to bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimation of JEV in Culex tritaeniorhynchus was 1.56, 2.36, 5.65 and 1.77 per 1000, respectively. JEV strains isolated during 2015–2018 all belonged to Genotype I. The E gene of amplified 139 samples differed from the JEV-L vaccine strain at fourteen amino acid residues, including the eight key residues related to virulence and virus attenuation. No divergence was observed at the sites related to antigenicity.  Although Japanese encephalitis (JE) has been well-controlled in Zhejiang Province, it remains a hot public health issue due to heavy disease burden. The epidemiological characteristics of JE have changed recently in Zhejiang Province. Increasing proportion of adult cases (>40 years old) have been reported. Genotype I (GI) of JEV has displaced genotype III (GIII) as the dominant genotype. The population immunity against JE was notably low among participants aged 4–25 years old, with the lowest GMT being in the 7-14-year-old group. Two doses of JEV-L did not provide effective protection after 4 or more years past the 2 nd dose. Therefore, issues about duration of protection and necessity of a booster dose at 6 years of age need further research. JEV strains isolated from mosquitoes during 2015–2018 in Zhejiang Province all belonged to GI. Compared with the JE vaccine strain, mutations at the eight amino acid residues on E gene related to virulence in Zhejiang strains were detected, while the antigenic sites remained the same. JE serological survey in healthy populations with different sequential immunization schedule should be conducted to provide evidence for reformation on JE immunization strategy, including type, dose and interval.  In addition to vaccination, JE surveillance in Zhejiang Province, including mosquito surveillance, antibody level surveillance in humans and pigs, acute meningitis and encephalitis syndrome surveillance (AMES), also have an important impact on JE prevention and control. Mosquito surveillance, which is the earliest and longest-running monitoring program (1982–1983, 2006–2019) in Zhejiang Province, provides important evidence for the natural infection rate and genotypes of JEV in mosquito vectors. As early as in 1982, JEV (GIII) was first isolated from Culex tritaeniorhynchus collected from pigpens and cowsheds in Dinghai County and Yiwu County. However, the JEV genotype has been replaced by GI since 2006 in all the following surveillance sites. Antibody level surveillance in healthy people was conducted from 2006–2016 (except for 2010), indicating the immunity barriers and herd immunity of the target population. Antibody level surveillance in pigs was conducted from 2006 to 2013, providing evidence for natural infection rate of JEV in reservoirs. However, with the integration and reduction of pig farms due to swine fever, sample collection from young piglets was considerably more difficult, and the surveillance program ended in 2014. AMES was conducted in Xianju County from 2006–2015 which reflected the true proportion of reported JE cases and explored the epidemiology and pathogenic spectrum of AMES. Although the surveillance program stopped in 2016, follow-up might be restarted.  Zhejiang Province, which belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate, used to be JE endemic area, with the highest incidence of 47.5/100,000 in 1967 [ 18 ]. With the widespread use of vaccines, the rapid development of economy and remarkable improvement of sanitary conditions, the JE incidence had decreased sharply after the 1970s. Fast review of JE vaccine application in Zhejiang Province, Inactivated Mouse Brain–Derived JE vaccine (MBD JEV, P3 strain) was first used in 1953, and then Inactivated Primary Hamster Kidney cell-derived JE vaccine was adopted in the 1970s. In 1989, live attenuated JE vaccine (JEV-L, SA 14-14-2 strain) was introduced and quickly became widespread. With the implementation of the National Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in 2008, two doses of JEV-L were required at 8 months and 2 years of age, respectively [ 19 ].  JEV is maintained in a natural transmission cycle involving mosquito vectors and amplifying vertebrate hosts, such as pigs and wading birds. JEV can proliferate in reservoirs, leading to a longer period of viremia and a higher viral load than in humans, who are identified as a dead-end host for JEV [ 5 ]. Mosquitoes, especially Culex tritaeniorhynchus in China, play an important role in JEV transmission chain. The mosquitoes become infected through biting of JEV reservoirs and then transmit JEV to humans through another bite. JEV belongs to the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae with only one serogroup. The JEV virion contains three structural proteins: nucleocapsid or core protein (C), non-glycosylated membrane protein (M), and glycosylated envelope protein (E). X-ray crystallography revealed that the E protein was composed of three distinct domains (I to III). Past studies [ 6 – 9 ] have confirmed that the E protein is responsible for neurovirulence and is involved in many important biological processes, including viral attachment, fusion, penetration, hemagglutination, virus neutralization, host range and cell tropism. According to the nucleotide sequence of E gene, JEV can be divided into five genotypes, I to V. Xiaoyan Gao conducted phylogenetic analysis on the whole genomic sequences of all the five genotypes and found that the ancestral lineage diverged in the order V, IV, III, II, and I[ 10 ]. The earliest reserved isolated JEV strain in China was derived from a viral encephalitis patient in Beijing, 1949, which belongs to GIII. During the routine monitoring in China, GI (first in 1979, Yunnan) and GV (first in 2009, Tibet) were successively discovered. The evolutionary trend of JEV genotype in China changes from GIII-only (1949–1971) to GIII+GI- coexist (1979–2004), and then to GI-dominant (2005-now) [ 2 , 10 , 11 ]. Recent studies [ 12 – 15 ] also show that GI is gradually replacing GIII and becoming the dominant type circulating in Asia. However, GV, which was first isolated in Malaysia in 1952 and has not been detected over the last 57 years, reemerged in two areas, and both are isolated from Culex tritaeniorhynchus: Tibet (2009) and South Korea (2010) [ 11 ]. A recent study [ 16 , 17 ] showed that the current JE vaccine induced low protective immunity against the emerging JEV GV. Therefore, changing geographic distribution of JEV genotypes brings new challenges for JE prevention and control.  Japanese encephalitis (JE), caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is one of the most serious vector-borne viral encephalitis in Southeast Asia, Western Pacific Region, and Northern Australia [ 1 – 2 ]. A mixed infection with yellow fever was also identified in Africa [ 3 ]. Approximately 3 billion people are exposed to the risk of JEV infection. It is estimated that 67,900 JE cases occur annually in 24 JE-endemic countries, with an overall incidence of 1.8 per 100,000 [ 4 ]. Although symptomatic Japanese encephalitis is rare, and only approximately 1 in 250 infections results in severe clinical symptoms, the case fatality rate can be as high as 30%. Permanent neurological or psychiatric sequelae can occur in 30%–50% of survivors, resulting in heavy health, social and economic burdens [ 1 ].  The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze the significance of JEV neutralizing antibody seropositive proportions against P3 strain among different age groups. The Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to compare the GMTs of neutralizing antibodies among different age groups. Multiple pairwise comparisons were conducted using Nemenyi test. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to assess the association between rates with increasing age or time-interval. Spearman correlation tests were conducted to assess the association between GMTs with increasing age or time-interval.  Viral RNA was extracted from 200μl supernatant from virus-infected BHK-21 cell cultures using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed by TaKaRa One Step RNA PCR kit (TaKaRa Bio Inc, Dalian, China). JEV RNA was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) [ 22 ]. The primers JE955f (5’-TGYTGGTCGCTCCGGCTTA-3’) and JE2536r (5’-AAGATGCCACTTCCACAYCTC-3’) were used to amplify the 1500-nt E gene. The PCR reaction conditions have been described elsewhere in detail [ 18 ].5μl of amplified PCR products of E gene were sequenced by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China) [ 23 ]. Sequencing assembly and verification were conducted using DNASTA.lasergene. v7.1. Sequence alignment and homologous comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences were conducted using MEGA 7.0 and DNAman7 (Lynnon Biosoft), respectively.  Mosquitoes were collected in pigpens and human dwelling from six counties in Zhejiang Province successively (Yiwu, Xianju, Jindong, Cixi, Jinyun and Wuyi) during June-August from 2015–2018 ( Fig 1 ). Permissions were obtained from owners/residents of colleting sites. These sites both have pig farms and rice paddy fields, which are essential factors for JEV maintenance. At least 8 hand-held aspirators and 12–16 light-traps per site were used to collect mosquitoes after sunset (18:30–21:00). Mosquitoes were classified according to morphological characteristics [ 21 ], pooled (50–100 female individuals per pool) by species, date, site and sampling method. Mosquitoes containing blood were excluded in case of the intervention from pig blood. Specimens were stored in liquid nitrogen during transportation and transferred to -80°C until processing for virus isolation.  Micro-neutralization assay was used to measure the presence of neutralizing antibodies against JEV. The procedure of micro-neutralization assay has been described elsewhere in detail [ 18 ]. The tests were conducted in Biological Safety Level 2 JE Laboratory of Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which joined the national JE lab-net in 2011. P3(GIII) strain was neutralized by serum samples from participants, which was obtained from the National Institution for Food and Drug Control, China. Seropositive level of JE was defined as a titer level of ≥10 (1/dil). Values below 10 were defined as 5 for the purpose of calculations.  A cross-sectional serological investigation was carried out in Jinhua city of Zhejiang Province in 2015–2016. The sample size for the survey was calculated by Epi Info [ 20 ], which is a public domain tools for epidemiological statistics. With the expected frequency set as 80%, confidence limits as 5%, design effect for cluster surveys as 2, and sample size was 492 with the confidence level as 95%. According to the JE vaccine immunization schedule and the epidemiological characteristics of JE in Zhejiang Province, participants were divided into twenty age groups (every month age was a group for under 1 year old, 1–3 years, 4–6 years, 7–14 years, 15–19 years, 20–24 years, 25–34 years, 35–44 years, 45 years and above). Sampling sites included maternity and pediatric hospital, kindergarten, school, community health service center, factory, and company. Combined with the annual physical examination, participants were requested to collect a 2ml-blood sample by qualified nurses, which would be stored in refrigerated containers (2–8°C) temporarily and transferred to -70°C before testing.  A total of 57 selected strains were involved in phylogenetic analysis, including 13 E gene samples (2015–2018), 10 strains (7 strains from 2006–2014 and 3 strains from 1982–1983) derived from Zhejiang Province and 34 strains derived from other provinces in China (Beijing, Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Guangxi, Gansu, Guizhou, Shandong, Shanghai, Shanxi, Sichuan, Taiwan, Tibet, Yunan) or abroad. The sequences of Zhejiang strains isolated in 1982–1983 and 2006–2018 are marked in black rhombus and circle, respectively. The virus name and Genbank accession number are noted. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by the maximum-likelihood method using MEGA 7.0 software package. Labels of strains conform to the following format: Strain name (including region and year of isolation) and GenBank accession number.  The 1,500-nt E gene were successfully amplified in 139 JEV-positive sequencing samples derived from mosquitoes in Zhejiang Province during 2015–2018, which had been submitted to GenBank (MK095778-MK095916). A total of 57 selected strains were involved in phylogenetic analysis ( Fig 4 ), including 23 E gene samples derived from Zhejiang Province, and 34 strains belonging to different genotypes derived from other provinces in China or abroad. All the 57 strains were clustered into five genotypes: I, II, III, IV and V. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Zhejiang strains were classified into two genotypes. The strains isolated in 1982–1983 were clustered into GIII and those isolated in 2006–2018 were all clustered into GI. Selected strains isolated from other regions in China or abroad in recent years all belong to GI. Zhejiang strains derived during 2016–2018 were genetically similar to the South Korea strain (KM496501) in 2013, while a relatively long distance was observed between the Zhejiang strains and the Japan strain (LC075515) in 2015.  Sequence analysis of E gene indicated that mainly 14 amino acid residues in the 139 newly detected E gene samples differed from the live attenuated vaccine SA 14-14-2 strain ( Table 5 ), including eight key amino acid residues related to virulence and virus attenuation (E107F→L, E138K→E, E176V→I, E177A→T, E264H→Q, E279M→K, E315V→A and E439R→K). The other eight amino acid residues were found to be different between P3 strain and the 139 samples (E76M→T, E129T→M, E222A→S, E227P→S, E306G→E, E327S→T, E366A→S, E408L→S). As expected, no mutation was observed at the 8 key amino acid residues between Beijing-1 strain and the 139 samples, another eight amino acid residues were detected to be different (E129T→M, E132S→P, E222A→S, E227P→S, E327S→T, E366A→S, E397Y→H, E473I→V). Compared with the three isolated GIII strains in Zhejiang Province, 4 amino acid residues in 139 JEV-positive GI samples showed differences (E129 T→M, E222 A→S, E327S→T, E366A→S).  Homologous comparison and sequence analysis of E gene were conducted among the 145 samples, including 139 JEV-positive samples (GI) derived in 2015–2018, 3 GIII strains derived in 1982–1983, the live attenuated vaccine (SA 14-14-2) strain, and 2 known virulent strains (P3 and Beijing-1). Homologous comparisons indicated that the 139 sequences of E gene derived from 6 surveillance sites maintained a high level of stability with each other at the nucleotide (range: 98.8%-99.8%) and amino acid (range: 99.4%-100%) levels, but a relatively lower sequence similarity to 1982–1983 GIII strains (87.2%-87.6% at the nucleotide level and 98.6%-98.8% at the amino acid level) and SA 14-14-2 strain (84.9%-86.1% at the nucleotide level and 96.7%-97.2% at the amino acid level). The nucleotide sequence divergences within the genotype from Zhejiang Province were only 0.2%-2.2% (GI) and 0%-0.9% (GIII). The nucleotide sequence divergences between GI and GIII from Zhejiang Province were 12.4%-12.8%.  Mosquitoes were classified into 1,495 pools according to morphological characteristics, of which 230 pools were JEV positive by RT-PCR amplification of E gene. The annual JEV positive rate among every site varied largely from the lowest of 0.73% (2018 Yiwu) to the highest of 36.31% (2017 Yiwu), and the rates of the same site for the adjacent two years also fluctuated extremely ( Table 4 , Fig 3 ). The overall positive rates of JEV RNA were respectively 15.38% and 16.33% among the total and the Culex tritaeniorhynchus during 2015–2018. The highest annual JEV positive rate among the Culex tritaeniorhynchus occurred in 2017 with 26.81%, and a relatively low rate occurred in 2018 with 10.23%. The infection rate according to bias-corrected MLE of JEV in the Culex tritaeniorhynchus with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 1.56 (0.91, 2.52), 2.36 (1.52, 3.52), 5.65 (4.67, 6.78) and 1.77 (1.35, 2.27) per 1,000, respectively.  A total of 87,201 mosquitoes belonging to more than 4 species (Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex pipiens pallens, Anopheles sinensis, and others) were collected from livestock sheds in 6 surveillance sites ( Fig 2 ) during every June to August from 2015–2018. Among them, 76,932 (88.22%) were Culex tritaeniorhynchus, 3,696 (4.24%) were Anopheles sinensis, 3,284 (3.77%) were Culex pipiens pallens, and 3,289 (3.77%) were other species, including Armigeres subalbatus, Aedes albopictus, Culex inatomii. Xianju County played an important role in mosquito surveillance from 2006 to 2015, and Yiwu County was the only site that conducted mosquito surveillance annually from 2015 to 2018. The remaining 4 counties were newly established in the last two years and contributed strongly to JE surveillance.  Among the 761 participants above 1 year old, 231 (30.35%) had a clear history of immunization on JE vaccine according to the immunization information system in Zhejiang Province, 219 of whom had two doses of JEV-L. According to the time interval between the 2 nd dose and date of blood drawn, 219 participants were divided into 5 groups (0–1 year, 1–2 years, 2–3 years, 3–4 years, and ≥4 years) ( Table 3 ). Through Spearman correlation test, the GMTs against P3 strains declined as the time interval increased (r = -0.304, P<0.001), and dropped to below the threshold level of protection (1:10) after 4 or more years past the 2 nd dose. Cochran-Armitage trend test indicated that the seropositive proportions against P3 strains significantly decreased with increasing time interval (P = 0.0006), and dropped to less than 50% more than 4 years after the 2 nd dose.  A total of 761 participants above 1 year old were divided into 8 groups according to the JE vaccine immunization schedule and the epidemiological characteristics of JE in Zhejiang Province ( Table 2 , Fig 2B ). The GMT and seropositive proportion against P3 strain of the 7-14-year-old group were both the lowest (6.89, 22.12%), while the 35-44-year-old group was the highest (19.68, 77.50%). The trends of the two indexes were similar in the age-group distributions: first declined rapidly to the lowest value at 7–14 years old and then increased slowly until 35 years old. Multiple pairwise comparisons indicated that the overall significant differences in GMT against P3 strain were mainly due to the 7-14-year-old group with other groups (P≤0.01 for all) and the 35-44-year-old group with the other three groups (4-6-year-old, 15-19-year-old, 20-24-year-old groups; P<0.05 for all).  A total of 429 participants under 1 year old were divided into 12 groups according to the month age ( Table 1 , Fig 2A ). The GMT and seropositive proportion of the 9-month age group were both the lowest (5.26, 4.17%), while those of the <1-month age group were both the highest (9.49, 37.93%). Through Kruskal-Wallis test, significant difference was detected in GMT among all the 12 groups (χ 2 = 31.25, P = 0.001). Further Nemenyi tests for multiple pairwise comparisons indicated that significant differences were only detected between the <1-month age group and the other three groups: 3 months of age, 9 months of age and 10 months of age (P 1 = 0.004, P 2 = 0.012, P 3 = 0.018). Although significance differences in seropositive proportions were found among all the 12 groups using Fisher’s exact test (P = 0.003), only 2 groups (<1-month age group and 3-month age group) showed significant differences using the adjusted Chi-square test (χ 2 = 12.22, P<0.001). The Spearman correlation test indicated that as the age of month increased, the GMT significantly declined (r = -0.225, P<0.001). The Cochran-Armitage trend test also supported the conclusion that the seropositive proportion decreased with increasing month age (P<0.0001).  A total of 429 infants (under 1 year old) and 761 participants (over 1 year old) were enrolled between Jan 2015 and Sep 2016; from each of them, a 2ml blood sample was drawn and tested successfully. Participants were sampled from maternity and pediatric hospital (429 participants), kindergarten (118), school (197), community health service center (89), factory (186), and company (171). The overall GMTs of JE neutralizing antibody against the P3 strain for participants under 1 year old was 6.36, with a seropositive proportion of 16.08% ( Table 1 ). The overall GMTs against the P3 strain for participants over 1 year old was 13.60, with seropositive proportions of 55.72% ( Table 2 ).  A total of 53 JE cases were reported in Zhejiang Province during 2015–2018, of which 28 (52.83%) were migrations from other provinces in China and acquired infections in Zhejiang. The annual incidence of JE ranged from 0.016/100,000 to 0.028/100,000, with an average annual incidence of 0.024/100,000. Only 1 case died in 2018 with an average annual mortality rate of 0.00045/100,000 and a case fatality rate of 1.89%. The occurrence of JE in Zhejiang Province had an obvious peak season (from June to August), and 37 cases (69.81%) developed illness in July. The mean age was 17.9 years old, ranging from 7 months to 60.3 years old. 29 cases (54.72%) were less than 15 years old. The highest average age-specific incidence was 0.109/100,000 for the 0-4-year-old group, followed by the 10-14-year-old group (0.094/100,000) and the 5-9-year-old group (0.088/100,000). The proportions of cases < 15 years old in 2015–2018 were 77.78%, 66.67%, 23.08% and 56.25% respectively. While the proportions of cases ≥ 40 years old were 0%, 6.67%, 23.08% and 12.50% respectively. According to the immunization information system, 13 cases (24.53%) had a clear immunization history of JE vaccine, 6 of which had one dose of JEV-L and 7 of which had two doses of JEV-L. The follow-up conducted 6 months after onset indicated that 31 cases (58.49%) were totally cured and 15 cases (28.30%) remained long-term sequelae, including cognitive impairment and neurological sequelae.  Discussion  Due to the high-quality childhood JE vaccination program and dramatically improved hygienic conditions, the situation of JE in Zhejiang Province was well controlled. However, the burden of Japanese encephalitis was still heavy due to the high rate of disability and mortality. In our study, 28.30% of 53 JE cases had long-term sequelae when followed-up at the sixth month after onset. Similar studies of JE prognosis conducted in China [25], Malaysia [26] and Cambodia [27] all reflected the heavy burden of JE on society, as well as families. Encouragingly, according to the morbidity and mortality weekly report on JE Surveillance and Immunization in Asia and Western Pacific Regions in 2016 [28], 22 of the 24 countries (92%) with JEV transmission risk conducted JE surveillance, which was only 75% in 2012. However, the JE immunization program has not fully covered, with the percentage of countries increasing from 46% in 2012 to 50% in 2016.  It was challenging that there was a shift to a greater proportion of adult cases in China, especially in the northern area of high latitude, which was previously low endemic. The incidence of JE under 15 years of age decreased significantly [29]. Most adult cases were middle-aged farmers who had never been vaccinated or had no chance of being naturally infected. As the global warming and rainfall increased, mosquitoes were more active and breed longer. The frequency of circulation and spread of JEV was remarkably increased, leading to a higher risk of JEV exposure [30]. JE prevention and control among adults has become an urgent problem due to the lack of a uniform and authoritative immunization strategy in China. Stronger emphasis should be placed on changing livestock farming style and enhancing mosquito control. The epidemiology trend was also detected in other regions [31–39] regardless of whether JE burden was high or whether the immunization program was fully implemented, such as Bangladesh [31], South Korea [32–33], Japan [34–35], and India [39].  Our study indicated that JE neutralizing antibody positive proportion was relatively lower in the <25-year-old age groups (except for the 1-3-year-old group). For the <1-year-old age group, GMT was highest at birth and significantly decreased with increasing month-age. The outcomes were consistent with the serosurvey conducted in 2013–2014 in Zhejiang Province [18]. It is suggested that the maternal transferred JE antibody level was under the threshold of protection (<1:10) even at birth, not to mention the follow-up. Therefore, it is essential to obtain a timely dose of JE vaccine at 8 months of age or even earlier if necessary. In addition, the seropositive proportion against P3 strain of 7-14-year-old group was only 22.12%, indicating that a booster dose at 6 years old may be needed. In our study, adults had a significantly higher GMT, mainly due to a wider range of activities and a higher chance of being bitten, which implied that the natural circulation of JEV was active and most were latent infections. On the other hand, the lower level of neutralizing antibodies in young age groups indicated that the immune barrier had not been fully established among children and adolescents, which was in accordance with the age-specific incidence of JE in Zhejiang Province. Although there was a tendency toward a greater proportion of adult JE cases, the age-specific incidence of the 0-4-year-old group was highest during 2015–2018. Despite Zhejiang Province started to use JE vaccine as early as in 1953, the vaccination rate was too low to establish herd immunity due to the turbulent society and underdeveloped economy to produce enough vaccine. In addition, the vaccine types and immunization doses differed greatly as time went on. In the early 1960s, one dose of inactivated mouse brain vaccine was used in limited area with highly adverse reaction rate. Then, live attenuated JE vaccine (JEV-L) was applied in 1989 and the vaccination rate among the ≤ 6-year-old population could not be guaranteed until the national Expanded Program on Immunization in 2008 in China. After several years of hard work, the overall incidence of JE in Zhejiang Province sharply declined. Since the last dose of JE vaccine for children is administered at 2 years old (live attenuated JE vaccine) or 6 years old (inactivated JE vaccine) in Zhejiang Province, the reason for seropositivity drop among 7–14 years old group maybe a combined effect of attenuation of antibody level and lack of natural infection due to the limited movement. Similar domestic serosurveys conducted in Yangzhou City [40] and Tongchuan City [41] both demonstrated lower GMT levels in young age groups. Other studies carried out in Jiangsu Province [42] and Xinyang City [43] showed considerably higher seropositive proportion than ours (67.13% of 5-14-year-old group and more than 82.98% for 7-14-year-old group, respectively). In non-endemic area, such as Tibet [44], the seroprevalence rate was even higher for the < 45-year-old group and only 4.2% for > 45-year-old population, which showed contrary tendency to ours on age-specific seropositive proportion. This was mostly due to increased movement to epidemic areas in younger populations. South Korea had accumulated extensive experience on JE surveillance. They found the overall positive rate among high-risk age groups (≥30 years old) was 98.1%, which was higher than ours (74.53%-77.50%). Differences in rates among different regions might be due to 3 possible reasons: the first was the different nature conditions and living style, including climate, landscape, rice paddy, pig farming and population mobility, which determine the natural infection baseline and significantly influence the circulation intensity of JEV. The second reason was the JE vaccination coverage rate as well as the immunization strategy, including doses, intervals and vaccine types, which played an important role in the establishment of immune barrier. Antibody attenuation and immunogenic persistence are core factors to the seroprevalence of antibody level. The third reason was test methods of neutralizing antibody, as well as the selection on JEV strains. Thus far, PRNT is the most commonly accepted test that can discriminate cross-reacting antibodies in primary flavivirus infections [45]. Some studies adopt ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) to measure the antibody level, which might give a biased outcome.  Regarding to the duration of protection and immunity, our study indicated that 4 or more years after the 2nd dose of JEV-L, the seropositive proportions decreased to 32.5%-37.5% and GMTs decreased to 8.08–9.11, further confirming that a booster dose at 6 years old would be necessary. Currently, two doses of primary hamster kidney (PHK) cell-derived, live attenuated vaccine based on SA 14-14-2 strain (GIII) are commonly used as EPI vaccine for ≤14-year-old populations in China. The waning trend of neutralizing antibody was also observed in Pan JR’s research [18]. To date, limited study has focused on the long-term immunogenicity of JEV-L vaccine, which is only used in a number of Asia countries. A 5-year follow-up of serosurvey in Nepal children with a single dose of JEV-L in 2000 indicated that the seropositive proportion was 89.9% in 2004 and it remained 63.8% in 2005 [46]. Long-term surveillance of duration for protection with different immunization strategies is still needed.  The mechanism of changing genotypes in traditional JE epidemic areas is a hot topic. Our study showed that no mutation was observed at the 8 key amino acid residues related to virulence and virus attenuation on E gene between GI and GIII strains, but another 4 amino acid residues were detected different (E129T→M, E222A→S, E327S→T and E366A→S), which were also partially or entirely detected in researches in Shanghai Province (E222, E327 and E366) [47], Shandong Province (E129, E222, E327 and E366) [48] and Thailand (E222, E327 and E366) [49]. Xiao C [50] suggested that GI strains developed higher viremia titers and longer viremic durations than GIII strains in avian cells and birds, resulting in a more efficient transmission in the bird-mosquito-bird cycle for GI JEV. Schuh AJ [15] found both GI and GIII viruses were circulating in nature, and sampling sites determined the detected genotype. They preferred that the shift trend was due to molecular adaptation at residue E15 and coevolution within the GI E protein alignment, leading to an acquired ability to be active in lower temperature areas. Amino acids on the top area of Domain III, where E327 and E366 were located are related to virulence, neurotropism and attenuation of flaviviruses [51], which implied that the two residues might have an effect on the tendency of GI to replace GIII. Currently, some articles have confirmed several significant amino acid residue mutations on E gene. For example, mutations at residues L107F, E138K, I176V, T177A, E244G, Q264H, K279M, A315V, S366A and K439R are essential and important for neurovirulence attenuation [52], especially L107F, E138K [53] and M279K [54]. Mutation at residue S123R increase pathogenicity [55]. Regarding to the amino acid residues at E337, E360 and E387, located in major antigenic loops in JEV domain III, are suggested to be the antigenic sites in relation to antibody neutralization [6,56], no divergence was detected in our study among Zhejiang JEV GI strains, GIII strains and the vaccine strain (SA 14-14-2). Therefore, the present widely used JE vaccine based on GIII strains may still provide protection and prevention for current GI strain prevalence. However, further cross-protective capacity tests are needed.  The present work has several limitations. First, random sampling was failed in enrollment of antibody level surveillance, especially for the <1-year-old group, which might not truly reflect the population immunity level. Second, PRNT was recommended by WHO to be the most accepted test to measure neutralizing antibody level, while our study used microseroneutralization assay. Third, isolated JEV strains derived from mosquitoes during 2015–2018 were limited, thus amplified 139 JEV-positive sequencing samples were used for E gene analysis. Last, mosquito collection was repeated annually in only one county (Yiwu), making it difficult to comment on trends of JEV RNA positivity over 2015 to 2018.  In summary, our study discovered that the maternal transferred JE antibody levels were below the threshold level of seropositive (<1:10), even at birth. The seropositive proportions were relatively lower in the 4-24-year-old group. A significant decreasing trend in GMT with age was detected not only in the under 1-year-old population (unvaccinated), but also in the 1-14-year-old group (vaccinated). GMTs against P3 strain decreased to below 1:10 after 4 or more years past the 2nd dose of JEV-L. JEV strains isolated from mosquitoes during 2015–2018 all belonged to GI with infection rates of 1.56, 2.36, 5.65 and 1.77 per 1,000 mosquitoes, respectively, suggesting a high risk of human infection in Zhejiang Province. No divergence on important antigenic sites of the E gene was detected between the Zhejiang JEV strains and the SA 14-14-2 strain, while the eight critical amino acid residues responsible for neuroattenuation were completely different. Thus, from an administrative perspective, further studies can be emphasized on the evaluation of JE vaccination coverage of target population, as well as the condition of cold-chain system. In addition, molecular pathology and toxicology tests, protective efficacy analysis of current JE vaccines to five genotypes of JEV, should be enhanced to contribute to the development of JE vaccines. Surveillance of provincial and national JE serological survey in healthy populations with different sequential immunization schedule can be conducted to provide evidence for reformation on JE immunization strategy."

Raya and the Last Dragon type Movie genre Animated  Raya and the Last Dragon is a movie of many firsts — one of which no one saw coming, not even its creators. The upcoming film will be one of the first Disney Animation features to be developed from remote locations in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.  With production ramping up around March just as the pandemic hit, the Raya team had to quickly reshuffle, working with equipment at home and communicating through Zoom. Despite the challenges, director Don Hall says the studio’s various teams rallied to create what he calls “the most beautiful animated film I've ever seen.” As the filmmaker behind beloved pictures like Winnie the Pooh, Big Hero 6, and Moana, Hall knows what he’s talking about.  EW can exclusively reveal a first look image from Raya, which happens to be the first fully rendered CG image of the movie. Featured in the picture are Raya and her trusty steed Tuk Tuk, a creature Hall describes as a fuzzy bear meets “an insect version of an armadillo.” As an evil force threatens the fictional kingdom of Kumandra, the two must leave their Heart Lands home and track down the last dragon to help stop the villainous Druun.  EW can also reveal that voicing Raya is Star Wars actress Kelly Marie Tran, who took over the part from Cassie Steele. Awkwafina, whose inclusion was announced last August, is playing Sisu, a dragon in human form who needs Raya’s help to reclaim her power and become her true dragon self.  Image zoom  Also announced are Hall and Carlos López Estrada as directors, while playwright Qui Nguyen is joining Crazy Rich Asians scribe Adele Lim as co-writer. Paul Briggs and John Ripa serve as co-directors.  “As filmmakers, Don and Carlos bring a combination of animation know-how and emotional storytelling to Raya and the Last Dragon, bringing our fantasy adventure to surprising, original, and dynamic heights,” Walt Disney Animation Studios’ Chief Creative Officer Jennifer Lee says in a statement to EW. “They both saw the potential for this film and had a strong vision for the story, especially for our lead character, played by the wonderfully talented Kelly Marie Tran. And no small feat, directors Don and Carlos, writers Qui and Adele, and the entire crew of 400 Disney Animation artists are making this film together, while separated and working from home.”  Not only will Raya be Disney Animation Studios’ first movie inspired by Southeast Asia, but Tran is the first Southeast Asian actress to lead a film from the company.  López Estrada, who helmed the critically acclaimed Blindspotting, says he never believed the fabled Hollywood casting stories — until he witnessed Tran’s audition. After her first recording session, he and Hall could only look at each other in stunned silence.  “I'm never going to forget it,” López Estrada tells EW. “I think [Don and I] rode in the car together, and we were quiet, looking at each other and nodding our heads just being like, ‘Yep, yep, yep. Kelly's perfect.’”  Put simply, Hall says “she is Raya — just her buoyancy and her positivity, but yet there's a strength as well to Kelly and the character.”  The filmmakers praise Tran’s comedy and ad-lib skills — which she says she honed at various improv schools throughout her career — but it was the level of emotion she brought to the role that really surprised them.  López Estrada says Tran’s session blew them away so much that they changed a scene to match her performance.  “We had this little dramatic moment; it was written as a few lines. And I remember her going, ‘Hey, I have some ideas because this is normally how I would say this or I have some questions. Do you mind if I tried it a little bit differently?’” the director recalls. “She went for it, improvised for a minute, and had us all in tears. We changed the scene and reblocked the animation so that it would follow what Kelly did that day because she just clicked on something that was so much bigger than anything we had imagined.”  Tran, who many audiences know as Rose Tico in The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, tells EW that Raya, the daughter of a chief, redefines the classic Disney princess. López Estrada also teases we can look forward to chases, fight scenes, and more “high-octane” action from our heroine.  “She is someone who is technically a princess but I think that what's really cool about this project, about this character, specifically is that everyone's trying to flip the narrative on what it means to be a princess,” Tran says. “Raya is totally a warrior. When she was a kid, she was excited to get her sword. And she grows up to be a really badass, gritty warrior and can really take care of herself.”  When it comes to representation, the filmmakers say they’re putting in the work to accurately celebrate the cultures that influenced the movie, including Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Producer Osnat Shurer, who was also behind Moana, says the studio sent creative teams on research trips to multiple countries in Southeast Asia and worked with a Southeast Asia Story Trust. They also collaborated with a Lao visual anthropologist who looks at every design before it’s finalized, as well as linguists, dancers, and Gamelan musicians from Indonesia.  Besides research, Nguyen says it was important that both his and Lim’s experiences inform the script.  “When you're telling a story and you're just doing it based on research, you end up always having to do it from the high end,” he says. “To have the artists who represent those cultures in there to be able to give the subtleties of what our families are actually like, what our relationships are actually like, has given a lot of nuances to this great adventure.”  Nguyen says it meant a lot for him and Lim to see their cultures represented in specific ways through martial arts or costumes, in addition to references to his Asian American identity. For the most part, movie heroes are white, and when they are Asian, they’re of East Asian descent.  “To be able to have some [heroes] that look like me and my kids, it's gonna matter to a lot of folks,” he says.  Shurer is especially excited to follow up Moana with another movie featuring a kick-ass female protagonist — in fact, Raya has three, including one fans will have to wait to discover.  Raya’s creative team is chugging toward the finish line, Hall says, with the film 50 percent animated at this point. What’s astonishing to the filmmakers isn’t the fact that they’ve been able to accomplish so much in the time of coronavirus and global unrest, it’s how much Raya mirrors the state of the world.  “I don’t know if Disney has ever made a movie that reflects so much what is happening with the world outside,” López Estrada says. “Even though our team has been working on this movie for years and years and years, it's going to feel like an idea that we had maybe a month ago because it talks so much about the themes and the questions and the hope that's happening today and also the lack of hope, and this wrestling with all these really, really important emotions that are happening right now.”  Raya and the Last Dragon is set to premiere March 12, 2021.

Governments are taking different strategies toward the new school year, depending on how many infections they’re seeing, the state of their health care systems and political considerations.  Here’s a look at how some countries are handling reopening schools amid the pandemic:  UNITED STATES  In the United States, where K-12 education is largely the responsibility of states and local school districts, President Donald Trump and his education secretary have urged schools to reopen in person.  But there has been heated public debate over the wisdom of bringing students back to the classroom, especially in communities with high daily new infections, so school reopening plans in the US vary widely.  Most of the largest urban districts are starting the year remotely after a summer surge in virus cases. But other districts plan to offer face-to-face instruction at least part of the time.  Some have already had to quarantine classrooms or shut down entire schools because of spreading COVID-19 infections.  AFRICA  Only six African countries have fully opened schools. In South Africa, students started returning to class this week class by class. It’s the second time schools are reopening, after an initial reopening resulted in new infections and prompted new closures.  As daily COVID-19 cases are decreasing, the government has said all grades should be back in schools by Monday.  The South African government has also allowed parents who don’t want their children to return to school to apply for homeschooling.  Elsewhere in Africa, Kenya has closed its schools for the rest of 2020. In Uganda, the government is procuring radios for rural villages to help poor families with remote learning.  JAPAN  Some schools in Japan reopened Monday after a shorter-than-usual summer vacation to make up for missed classes earlier due to the pandemic.  At an elementary school in Tokyo, mask-wearing children held an opening ceremony in classrooms instead of the school gym for better social distancing.  CHINA  As of last month, 208 million Chinese students, or roughly 75% of the country’s total had returned to class, many on some type of staggered class schedule. The rest are expected to return by Sept. 1.  PHILIPPINES  The Philippines has repeatedly postponed reopening schools, which are now scheduled to reopen Oct. 5. Even then, only remote-learning classes will be allowed.  President Rodrigo Duterte says face-to-face classes should resume only when a COVID-19 vaccine is available.  SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA  Schools remain shut in India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In Sri Lanka, where the government says the virus has been contained to two clusters, schools were allowed to partially open this month for several grades facing government examinations shortly.  Schools throughout Cambodia remain closed, while those in Thailand and Malaysia all reopened in July and August. Indonesian schools reopened in July with half-capacity classes and limited hours.  FRANCE  France is sending its 12.9 million students back to classrooms on Tuesday despite a sharp increase in infections in recent weeks.  President Emmanuel Macron’s government wants to bridge inequalities for children that were worsened by the coronavirus lockdown and get more parents back to work.  All teachers, middle school and high school students will have to wear masks all day, and schools will have one-way corridors and limited gatherings. Cafeterias will reopen to help children who rely on state-subsidized hot meals.  The Paris region is giving out free laptops in case children are sent back into a lockdown.  GERMANY  Most German students are already back in school — and at least 41 of Berlin’s 825 schools have reported virus cases.  Thousands of students have been quarantined around the country after outbreaks that some doctors attribute to family gatherings and travel during summer vacations.  But Germany is determined not to close schools anew, so they’re sending individual students or classes into quarantine instead.  Mask and other rules vary state-to-state. In Berlin children can take masks off during class; some states require masks all the time.  The government says keeping schools open is more important than bringing fans back to sports stadiums or allowing big crowds for concerts.  BRITAIN  Most of the U.K.’s 11 million students haven’t seen a classroom since March, but children are to start returning to schools across England on Sept. 4.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called reopening schools a “moral duty,” and his government even threatened to fine parents who keep their kids at home.  Among measures in place are hand-washing stations and staggered starts and lunch times, but masks aren’t generally required. Some high schools are mulling a hybrid mix of physical and online classes but the goal is to go back in person.  Britain has more than 41,500 virus-related deaths, the highest confirmed toll in Europe, and Johnson’s government has been strongly criticized for its handling of the pandemic.  SPAIN  Amid new infections and increasing anxiety from parents and criticism from teachers’ unions, Spanish officials are adapting their plans before schools start reopening Sept. 4.  They’re hiring 11,000 additional teachers, building makeshift classrooms in schoolyards to gain space and creating “bubbles” of students who are allowed to mix with each other but not with outsiders.  Authorities are facing the added pressure of wanting to reactivate the economy in a country with relatively high child poverty rates. Save the Children is asking for electronic devices to be distributed to disadvantaged families.  Teachers’ unions are calling for strikes. Madrid plans in-person classes for all students under 12, and a mix of online and in-class teaching for older students.  NORDIC COUNTRIES  Most schools resumed class last week in the Nordics, as they did at the end of the spring term, amid a general consensus that there is more harm for kids staying home than the risk of sending them to school.  Sweden has few virus measures other than banning parents from entering schools when they drop children off.  High school students even protested after Denmark’s second-largest city shut their schools because of new infections, saying they don’t learn as much remotely and questioning why they can go to shopping malls, gyms or the movies with lots of others but not school.

LIDCs have both been hit hard by external shocks and are suffering severe domestic contractions from the spread of the virus and the lockdown measures to contain it. At the same time, limited resources and weak institutions constrain the capacity of many LIDC governments to support their economies.  Absent a sustained international effort to support low-income developing countries, permanent scars are likely to harm development prospects.  Growth in LIDCs is likely to come to a standstill this year, compared to growth of 5 percent in 2019. Further, absent a sustained international effort to support them, permanent scars are likely to harm development prospects, exacerbate inequality, and threaten to wipe out a decade of progress reducing poverty.  Multiple shocks take a heavy toll  LIDCs entered the COVID-19 crisis in an already vulnerable position--for example, half of them suffered high public debt levels. Since March, LIDCs have been hit by an exceptional confluence of external shocks: a sharp contraction in real exports, lower export prices, especially for oil, less capital and remittances inflows, and reduced tourism receipts.  Take remittances, for example, that exceeded 5 percent of GDP in 30 (out of 59) LIDCs in 2019. Between April and May, they fell by 18 percent in Bangladesh, and by 39 percent in the Kyrgyz Republic, compared to the previous year. The repercussions are likely to be felt widely where remittances are the main source of income for many poor families.  As for the domestic impact, while the pandemic has evolved more slowly in LIDCs than in other parts of the world, it is now inflicting a sizeable toll on economic activity. Many LIDCs acted swiftly to contain the spread. From mid-March, when reported infections were still low, they put in place containment measures including international travel controls, school closures, the cancelation of public events and gathering restrictions.  Mobility--a proxy for domestic economic activity--also declined sharply, and continued to retreat as measures were broadened to include workplace closures, stay-at-home orders, and internal movement restrictions. From late April/early May, containment measures have gradually loosened and mobility has recovered, but has yet to return to pre-crisis levels.  Managing difficult trade-offs with scarce resources  Most LIDCs cannot sustain strict containment measures for long as large segments of the population live at near subsistence levels. Large informal sectors, weak institutional capacity, and incomplete registries of the poor make it difficult to reach the needy. Further, governments have only limited fiscal resources to support them.  Recent surveys conducted across 20 African countries reveal that more than 70 percent of respondents risk running out of food during a lockdown that lasts more than two weeks.  Faced with such constraints, the short but sharp front-loading of containment fulfilled a critical purpose: it flattened the infection curve, while granting time to build up capacity in the health sector. Many LIDCs have followed this path: while they expended less fiscal support to their economies than advanced or emerging market economies, the share of additional spending dedicated to health has been higher.  As broad-based containment becomes difficult to sustain, LIDCs should transition to more targeted measures, including social distancing and contact tracing--Vietnam and Cambodia are good examples. Policy support should focus on supporting the most vulnerable, including the elderly, and on limiting the health crisis's long-term fallout.  For example, protecting education is critical to ensure that the pandemic does not--as highlighted in a recent Letter to the International Community by a group of eminent persons--""create a COVID generation who loses out on schooling and whose opportunities are permanently damaged.""  Where the necessary infrastructure exists, technology can sometimes be leveraged in innovative ways. For example, to limit the spread of the virus, Rwanda is leveraging its digital finance infrastructure to discourage the use of cash. Togo employs the voter registration database to channel assistance to vulnerable groups.  A decade of progress under threat  Despite the best efforts of LIDC governments, lasting damage seems unavoidable in the absence of more international support. Long-term ""scarring""--the permanent loss of productive capacity--is a particularly worrisome prospect.  Scarring has been the legacy of past pandemics: mortality; worse health and education outcomes that depress future earnings; the depletion of savings and assets that force firm closures--especially of small enterprises that lack access to credit--and cause irrecoverable production disruptions; and debt overhangs that depress lending to the private sector. For example, in the aftermath of the 2013 Ebola pandemic, Sierra Leone's economy never recovered to its pre-crisis growth path.  Scarring would trigger severe setbacks to LIDCs' development efforts, including undoing the gains in reducing poverty over the last 7 to 10 years, and exacerbating inequality, including gender inequality. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will thus be even more difficult to achieve.

Priorities include: (1) guaranteeing essential health supplies, including cures and vaccines when they are discovered; (2) protecting critical supply chains, especially for food and medicines; (3) avoiding protectionist measures; (4) ensuring that developing economies can finance critical spending through grants and concessional financing; (5) ensuring that LIDCs' international liquidity needs are met, which requires International Financial Institutions to be resourced adequately; (6) reprofiling and restructuring debt to restore sustainability where needed, which, in many cases, may require relief beyond the G20/Debt Service Suspension Initiative; and (7) keeping sight of the United Nations' SDGs, including by reassessing needs when the crisis subsides.  The COVID-19 pandemic will be defeated only when it and its socioeconomic consequences are overcome everywhere. Urgent action by the international community can save lives and livelihoods in LIDCs. The International Monetary Fund is doing its share: among other things, the IMF has provided emergency financing to 42 LIDCs since April. It stands ready to provide more support and help design longer-term economic programs for a sustainable recovery.

As of Aug. 12, the government had agreed with 68 countries to offer medical devices after securing ¥48 billion in coronavirus-related aid expenses in the extra budget for fiscal 2020. It hopes to strengthen its presence as a major donor in the field of public health, officials have said.  ""Japan is advocating for and taking the lead in providing support to developing countries with vulnerable health care systems to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus,"" Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told a recent news conference.  Responding to a question about China's ""mask diplomacy,"" Motegi said: ""Our grant aid is being carried out at unprecedented speed. Japan is aiming to provide support for health in developing countries and strengthen their health care systems, rather than sending individual items such as masks.""  China has said it has provided medical supplies to more than 150 countries and sent medical experts to 27 countries.  Japan is donating ambulances, beds, CT scanners and other medical gear to around 100 countries, such as Myanmar and Djibouti, as well as to Palau and other Pacific island countries.  Motegi said in July that Japan will also spend ¥11.6 billion to extend technical cooperation for medical workers and provide health care supplies to the five countries along the Mekong River — Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.  The government says it is not only giving out medical equipment to the countries for their short-term needs but also providing follow-up and maintenance support over the medium and long term.  While Japan hopes to resume the dispatch of experts to train personnel for infectious disease control once travel restrictions are lifted, it is currently using teleconference systems to give advice and train public health officials and engineers.  Japan is also stepping up its supply of the anti-viral drug Avigan of Fujifilm Holdings Corp., which is currently carrying out clinical tests on it in Japan as a potential coronavirus treatment, for countries interested in using it.  Motegi has said around 80 countries have requested supplies of Avigan, with Estonia becoming the first to receive the medicine in early May.  While the effectiveness of the drug in treating COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has not been proven in clinical studies so far, Tokyo is offering the drug upon request.  Japan has disbursed $1 million to the U.N. Office for Project Services, which will buy the drug from a Japanese supplier and deliver it to countries that have shown interest.  Nonetheless, Beijing's diplomatic charm offensive is a cause for concern for Japan, which has been locked in disputes with its neighbor over history and the sovereignty of islands.  Some analysts say that China could use its medical and health assistance to garner tacit support for its controversial policies, including its assertiveness in the South and East China seas, alleged human rights abuses of the Uighur population or its hard-line attitude toward Taiwan and pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong.  Such fears could materialize if China outshines other major countries at coronavirus diplomacy, they say.  China, a front-runner in vaccine development, has pledged to globally share any successful vaccine, apparently aiming to increase its influence. Successful vaccine development could give China a diplomatic advantage that would be hard for Japan to match.  Japanese drugmakers have only a handful of coronavirus vaccine and COVID-19 treatment candidates in their pipelines, with medical startup Anges Inc. being the only Japanese drugmaker conducting a clinical trial of an experimental vaccine on humans.  China is running ahead in the intensifying race to develop a vaccine, with Sinovac Biotech Ltd., CanSino Biologics Inc. and China National Pharmaceutical Group Co., known as Sinopharma, all conducting Phase 3 clinical trials of drugs, the final step before approval, according to the World Health Organization.  The other candidates in Phase 3 tests are those developed by U.S., British and German companies.  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in late July it ""will give priority"" to the Philippines if it succeeds in developing a vaccine.  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has recently faced criticism for backing down on the country's territorial claims in the South China Sea that overlap with Beijing's after gaining assurances about receiving coronavirus vaccines from China.  ""Because of its high-handed approach, there have been frictions between recipient countries of Chinese aid and China, but if an infection spreads at a rapid speed many countries have no choice but to depend on Chinese aid,"" wrote Shinichi Kitaoka, president of the Japan International Cooperation Agency, in an article in the latest edition of a diplomacy magazine published by the Foreign Ministry.  ""It will be something of a nightmare if China dominates"" the fight against coronavirus and uses it to gain a political advantage, he wrote.

Travellers have been warned that changes can be made at short notice, meaning anyone going overseas must be able to quarantine when they return.  Hundreds of thousands of holidays have been cancelled this year, crippling the aviation and tourism industry, as the pandemic continues to rage.  As the number of new cases continues to rise across Europe, the list of countries Brits can safely visit continues to decrease.  Yesterday, Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic were stripped from the 'safe' list, meaning people arriving in the UK after 4am on Saturday must self-isolate for two weeks.  Popular holiday destinations France and Spain have already been removed - with little hope that they will be reinstated soon, as both countries continue to report thousands of new cases.  Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago, Austria, Monaco, Malta, Turks & Caicos and Aruba, Andorra, Belgium and the Bahamas, Serbia and Luxembourg have also previously been removed.  But Cuba has now been added to the 'safe' list, alongside Portugal, meaning holidaymakers can now travel there without having to isolate on return.  But the country has strict restrictions for tourists entering the country - with anyone staying at a hotel having to take a coronavirus test 48 hours before arrival.  The government has issued a list of 65 countries where Brits do not have to quarantine on return.  But many countries have restrictions on Brits entering, such as Norway which requires all UK citizens to self-isolate for 10 days.  Are you on holiday in any of these countries at the moment or due to fly out? Email us at webtravel@trinitymirror.com  (Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)  Meanwhile, others are not accepting any UK tourists or require visitors to undergo coronavirus tests before entering the country.  We've pulled together the latest information on where holidaymakers can visit without having to self-isolate there or on return or have to undergo a mandatory test.  This list will be subject to change as more countries are added or removed.  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has warned British holidaymakers that quarantine rules could continue to change rapidly.  Mr Shapps told Sky News: “Look there is a travel corridor list and I think it contains probably still about 55, 60 countries. It changes every week – a country went on – Cuba went on – the list yesterday, or goes on at the weekend.  “So, they are there for a reason. However, when people travel at the moment when coronavirus is still a thing… just need to be aware that unfortunately things can change very quickly and, you know, if you go with your eyes open and you know that things can change, it won’t then come as so much as of a surprise.  “Though as I say, sometimes countries just move very quickly.”  The 14 destinations without restrictions:  (Image: NurPhoto/PA Images)  Denmark  Faroe Islands  Germany  Greece  Gibraltar  Greenland  Italy  Liechtenstein  Poland  Portugal  San Marino  Slovakia  Slovenia  Turkey  The short list means many holidaymakers must self-isolate on return for 14 days after travelling abroad.

However, travel will be subject to some conditions, including pre-entry tests for COVID-19.  The government also said that it is working to speed up the issuance of new visas to let in some businesspeople who were unable to enter due to the entry restrictions.  The government decided Friday to lift strict re-entry restrictions on foreign nationals with a legal residence status in Japan, which were introduced April 3 as a preventive measure aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. The revised policy will enable all foreign residents to re-enter the country after notifying immigration authorities about their travel plans.  Starting in September, foreign residents will be required to undergo coronavirus testing upon entry and observe a 14-day quarantine period. The same conditions apply to Japanese nationals coming from abroad.  Additionally, however, all foreign nationals will be required to submit proof they were tested for COVID-19 within 72 hours prior to their departure. The condition has already been imposed on students, working visa holders and people with “family stay” visas who had left Japan before the imposition of the ban and were granted permission to return on Aug. 5. Starting from Tuesday, the condition will be applicable to all residents and new arrivals.  The announcement comes amid intensifying criticism of the existing policy from the foreign community and business groups heavily affected by the restrictions to travel, which have cut thousands of people off from access to their livelihoods for months and have been described as discriminatory.  Under the existing travel restrictions, only foreign residents who had left the country before the introduction of the entry restrictions have been allowed to return. Meanwhile, those who have left the country after their destinations were added to the entry ban list and those who are planning to leave the country temporarily need special permission to re-enter from immigration officials.  Such permits have been issued in limited situations, such as in order to attend the funeral of a relative, to appear as a witness at a court hearing or a health emergency. However, exceptional treatment was not guaranteed.  With the changes that will come into effect Tuesday, people who had left Japan temporarily without being granted permission to re-enter the country will be able to do so, but they will need to contact local Japanese embassies or consular offices to inform them of their travel plans and complete entry procedures.  No resident will require special circumstances to be granted permission to re-enter the country but those who are planning to re-enter will need to contact the Immigration Services Agency before their departure from Japan. Such requests will be accepted online.  The procedure is needed to keep a record of people departing from Japan and boost testing capacity at airports.  The revised policy will apply to travelers from 159 countries and regions following the latest additions to the travel ban, which will come into effect on Sunday. The 13 newly added nations are Belize, Bhutan, Ethiopia, Gambia, Lesotho, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Sudan, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The update follows the Foreign Ministry’s decision to raise its travel advisory to the second-highest on its four-point scale for infectious diseases earlier this week.  As of Aug. 13, around 192,000 foreign nationals were outside the country. Of them, 29,000 have left since the entry restrictions were imposed, including those who have not been granted permission to return under the strict policy. The entry restrictions, which originally denied entry to all working visa holders, students and people with family members in Japan using “family stay” visas, have left around 90,000 foreign nationals with valid legal statuses unable to return.  About 2.63 million foreign nationals with valid visa statuses in Japan, excluding diplomats and those with special permanent resident certificates issued for people of Korean and Taiwanese descent, are subjected to the entry restrictions.  The government also said that it has also resumed processing of entry requests from international students ― both those seeking re-entry and those who have been newly admitted to educational institutions ー with priority given to students who receive scholarships sponsored by the government.  Japan is also set to allow entry to non-Japanese whose visas have been already processed but who could not enter the country to start educational courses or work.  International business groups from Europe, the United States, Australia and New Zealand have repeatedly called on Japan to relax the entry barriers, which have significantly affected foreign-owned companies and businesses in Japan relying on international workers.  Japan is gradually opening its borders to business travelers including those seeking new visas, with priority to be given to countries that have been relatively successful in bringing the pandemic under control. The government has been in talks with around 13 countries including New Zealand, Australia and China about resuming business travel, but so far it has begun to accept business travelers only from Thailand and Vietnam. Between Aug. 17 and Aug. 23, 160 Thai and Vietnamese were allowed entry under the plan aimed at businesspeople.  The government said that from September it will start letting in business travelers from Singapore as well as Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Japan heavily relies on workers from Southeast Asia, who fill gaps in industries suffering from severe labor shortages such as agriculture and construction. It remains unknown, however, when Japan will allow business travelers from other countries in.  The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan has said that 91 percent of companies that took part in a survey on the effects of the entry ban have reported that it has placed a burden on their business. In a statement released Thursday, the ACCJ said that many business owners have reported that key personnel from their companies will not be returning to Japan, as the ban has halted their ongoing projects. Nearly 40 percent of survey respondents reported that they expect a loss of revenue as a direct result of the entry ban.  A majority of American companies in Japan that took part in the survey have said that the entry ban will affect future investment decisions. Some respondents also pointed to long-lasting negative effects of the ban, which has “reinforced the negative perception that Japan does not provide a level playing-field for business and discriminates against foreign workers.”  “While many members recognize that actions are necessary to curb the spread of the coronavirus, restricting entry into Japan only for foreigners has reinforced perceptions of discrimination and makes Japan less favorable for conducting business,” the statement read.  European companies with headquarters in Japan have also been heavily burdened by the entry restrictions. A survey conducted by the European Business Council between June and July has shown that a majority of European companies have been forced to suspend internal development projects, as key specialists could not come to Japan, or were concerned about their turnover due to the halt of ongoing projects. Also, 44 percent of European firms were expecting a loss of revenue as a result of the ban.

Her great-aunt made and sold traditional silk to the French during colonial rule, passing the technique on to Thuan, who started weaving when she was six in her village on the outskirts of Hanoi.  But three years ago Thuan spotted a new opportunity in the lotus stems left to rot in nearby fields after the seeds had been harvested for food.  She began extracting the fibre found in the stems to make ""lotus silk"", an exclusive fabric highly sought by fashion designers.  ""I was the first in Vietnam,"" the 65-year-old told AFP proudly.  ""I started all by myself, then I trained those already in my workshop,"" she added.  Farmers often toil for hours to clear lotus paddies of rotting stems, which ruin the soil and bring unwanted insects.  But thanks to her vision, Thuan today leads a team of about 20 mostly female workers who snap off the stems in the paddies, before they tease out the fragile fibres and roll them into thread.  Dressed head-to-toe in brown silk and wearing a pearl necklace -- the same outfit she dons as she picks through the lotus paddies -- Thuan describes her work.  It's a painstaking process -- a large scarf requires the thread of around 9,200 stems and would take one worker around two months to complete -- but Thuan insists it's worth it.  ""I see this as my task now, to generate jobs, and to do my bit for the environment,"" she said, adding that during busy periods, she employs hundreds to weave from home.  The profits are another reason to persevere.  While a regular silk scarf might go for $20, even a smaller lotus version -- popular with pre-coronavirus tourists -- fetches more than 10 times that.  Although lotus silk is made in a handful of countries -- including Myanmar and Cambodia -- Thuan is seen as an innovator in Vietnam.  She has been supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, which kickstarted a three-year national-level project to further develop the harvesting technique.  Nguyen Thi Xoa, 40, was taught by Thuan in 2017 and she now wants her children to follow in her thread.  ""At the beginning it was very difficult, but now I love doing it,"" she said. ""It's a stable job and I'm proud of it.""  © 2020 AFP"

… [+8616 chars]","Hotel awards may seem incongruous during the coronavirus crisis when people can’t travel but most organizers aren’t skipping even a year, saying these recognitions are needed more than ever before.  Last month saw some of the media kicking off the industry’s 2020 awards season, including Travel + Leisure’s World’s Best Awards, Tripadvisor’s Travelers’ Choice Awards and Agoda’s Customer Review Awards.  The hotel categories are always in super abundance and Asia continues to take the cake. Travel + Leisure named the top 100 hotels in the world. Of 4,817 Tripadvisor’s awards, 4,292 are hotels, the rest restaurants, airlines, attractions and experiences. Agoda, largely a hotels booking platform, even expanded its awards vastly this year, saluting 30,000 properties from just 7,800 last year. It extended the reach from 22 to 114 markets in Asia-Pacific, North America and Europe.  In a travel lockdown, however, these awards look somewhat out of place. Organizers said votes were taken before the pandemic, and that the awards would help travelers in deciding future stays.  Yet the crisis has changed hotels tremendously. Teams that won hearts for unforgettable service have come undone by massive layoffs. The best hotels of the next few years are probably those that can keep guests safe without compromising on the experience, not judged on the usual factors like location, facilities and amenities.  Even before the pandemic there was already some ambivalence whether hotel awards are needed at all from the customers’ standpoint. Peer reviews or trusted blogs that address specific niches are doing a good job in helping travelers decide who’s best for what occasion. And the smarter and discerning guests become, the more awards appear arbitrary. For example, the top hotel in the world 2020, going by Travel + Leisure, is Capella Ubud, Bali, Indonesia. It’s Viroth’s Hotel, Siem Reap, Cambodia going by Tripadvisor.  It is also the industry’s worst-kept secret that some awards can be bought, or are heavily driven by advertising or sponsorship. Unless their organizers use the coronavirus crisis as the perfect time to overhaul them, such awards could go to the dogs the way the hotel rating system has.  Meant to Inspire  Thus far, the show is largely going on. Voting for, say, the World Travel Awards 2020 has been extended to September 24, never mind that trips are few and far between. Travel + Leisure is accepting votes for 2021 from October this year. It did not reply to Skift’s questions if there are plans to redesign awards in view of Covid-19 realities.  In the trade, TTG Asia Media, Asia’s oldest travel business publisher, has postponed its TTG Travel Awards this year, a first since the event was organized annually since 1989. That’s a wise decision, for it doesn’t make sense to ask travel agents to vote for the best hotels, and vice versa, when neither have clients or are closed, some for good.  “We understand that many of our industry colleagues are now devoting their time to taking care of their team mates and partners, and pivoting their businesses for stability,” it said. It is “hopeful” of resuming the awards in 2021.  Those that go ahead say that awards matter more in Covid-battered tourism because they inspire people to travel and guide them on the best choices.  This year, said Travel + Leisure to its readers, your vote counts more than ever. “Voting for a hotel you love or an island where you’ve had the happiest holiday is a way to show your appreciation for the places you can’t wait to get back to.”  Awards also provide vital feedback for hoteliers and accommodation partners to benchmark services and make improvements, said Errol Cooke, Agoda’s vice president of partner services.  Most Coveted  Hoteliers interviewed by Skift said recognitions from online travel platforms are among the most coveted awards because they are based on millions of customer reviews from the past year and reflect current trends.  Agoda, for example, presents its Customer Review Awards to winners in July or August, based on 12 months of review data. Hotels must have an 8.0 or above review score, and a minimum of 10 reviews. Other criteria include good pricing and availability via the Agoda platform.  According to Cooke, 84 percent of people already use customer reviews to make decisions on where to stay and this will only increase in post-pandemic travel environment. The award badge makes it easier to connect travelers to peer-recommended properties. This year, winning hotels could download their certificate and upload their badge online.  Cooke expects next year’s awards to reflect more domestic stays. “While international travel has taken a significant hit, domestic travel campaigns such as [Thailand’s] GoLocal have helped to alleviate the shortfall, and we expect customer reviews will become even more important as travelers seek assurance on quality and exceptional value hotels even in their home market for domestic travel.”  Similarly, Tripadvisor’s Jane Lim, vice president of global markets, said, “Despite the travel restrictions and various safety measures put in place around the world, travelers are still traveling, albeit in different ways. We’re seeing travelers taking short domestic trips, exploring their own neighborhoods and supporting local businesses and restaurants. As the world begins to travel again, these awards can highlight some of the best places to go, offering inspiration for travelers and diners as well as much needed support for businesses around the world.”  Tripadvisor’s Travel Safe Initiative, which allows businesses to share their safety measures and overall response to the pandemic, address guests’ new priorities and keep awards relevant, she said.  Redesign  It’s those awards that are linked to advertising that should be redesigned, said Girish Jhunjhnuwala, founder of Ovolo Group which operates hotels in Hong Kong and Australia.  “Those like Tripadvisor’s are interesting, because they are a collation of people’s choices, people who have stayed at the hotels, and there’s no way of influencing that,” he said.  There are reputable awards, and those where you can buy your way to the top, which can be detrimental to the awards industry, said Stefan Leser, CEO of Langham Hospitality Group. His picks of the former include the likes of Tripadvisor and Agoda, long-standing ones such as Travel + Leisure, and untraditional ones such as Skift’s IDEA Awards, an annual recognition of excellence in innovation, design and experiences across the traveler journey.  Both CEOs said awards matter greatly as they are a recognition that the hotel and its team are doing something right and they keep hotels working hard so as not to fall behind.  More can be done, however, with Covid-19 opening up the chance to find ways to recognize a new set of paragons, such caringness and adaptability.  “There are two dimensions to caringness,” said Leser. “From customers’ perspective, do they feel they are treated according to protocols, or as individuals with their needs truly recognized? In times of social distancing, does the interaction with guests feels like an alienation, or has it become deeper?  “From the employees’ perspective, are we going through this period as a team, not just among those who are still on board but colleagues who’ve lost their jobs? Nobody challenges that there are fewer jobs as a result of the crisis, but it’s how you handle it.”  Leser said what struck him the most during recent travels is how the question “How are you?” has lost its casualness or superficiality and become more meaningful.  He said more could also be done to salute not just the GM of the Year but other hotel professionals. “We have not marketed well enough that we’re the most stress-resistant and agile people. When dealing with new circumstances, we adjust quickly. No other industry is more agile. We’re used to dealing with uncertainties. When a guest walks, we don’t know what he or she wants from us.”  Ovolo’s Jhunjhnuwala said a new award category could look at how hotels adapt themselves to the crisis.  “It’s how you make the best of everything. For example, with social distancing, we don’t want guests to miss their happy hour, so we have a trolley that comes around to your room and the staff makes a cocktail outside your room and give it to you. Or a barista goes to make coffee every day that you’re on a 14-day quarantine. At the end of the day, guests have been tested negative twice, once before boarding the flight and once arriving in Hong Kong. We don’t need to treat them like prisoners.”  All good suggestions that hopefully will get organizers thinking how to make awards more interesting and relevant.  And the ones who do sure deserve a gold medal."

If anything, the coronavirus has proven just how resilient the transnational cartels dominating the meth trade out of Myanmar truly are, experts say.  ""We think it's business as usual in 2020, which is to say that supply is still surging just as it has been in the last few years,"" Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and the Pacific chief for the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, told VOA.  ""If Myanmar, Thai, Vietnamese, Cambodia data is any indication — and we think it is — then at least within the Mekong the supply is as high or higher than last year in those countries,"" he said by phone from Bangkok.  The price is right  Methamphetamine prices across the region last year were already the lowest they had been in a decade, even as the purity of the drugs shot up.  Data compiled by the UNODC during the pandemic show the price of a kilogram of crystal meth, or ice, in Myanmar and Vietnam on par with 2019. In Cambodia, the price of ""yaba,"" a popular mix of meth and caffeine, has actually fallen by roughly half, to less than $1 per pill. The UNODC says Thailand also reported a drop in both ice and yaba prices in late 2019 and early 2020 compared with the same period a year before.  Long a hub of the heroin trade, the Golden Triangle — where the remote and lawless corners of Laos, Myanmar and Thailand meet — has in recent years seen transnational cartels turn it into one of the world's premier meth laboratories, according to the UNODC. Protected by government-backed militias and ethnic rebel armies in Myanmar's eastern Shan state, the U.N. agency says the cartels’ drugs pour across Southeast Asia and on to more lucrative markets as far off as Australia and Japan. The UNODC now puts the meth market in East and Southeast Asia at some $61.4 billion a year.  Since the pandemic, drug seizures have kept pace with 2019 as well, or even picked up.  In early July, Thai authorities said they intercepted 1.42 tons of crystal meth on its way to Malaysia. In May, authorities in Myanmar announced Asia's largest drug bust in decades, netting 200 million meth pills and 500 kilograms of ice; they also seized 35.5 metric tons and 163,000 liters of precursor chemicals and arrested 33 suspects.  On their own, more seizures can mean either a spike in production or better enforcement. The fact that prices have stayed low argues strongly in favor of the former, said Richard Horsey, a senior adviser to the International Crisis Group based in Myanmar.  Given the stable prices for the drugs, ""there's every indication that big seizures reflect big production, and not that ... somehow the police are winning this and seizing everything that's being produced,"" he said.  ""So, I think the transnational criminal organizations, the synthetic drug trade in Shan state, has shown itself to be extremely resilient to COVID,” he told VOA by phone from Yangon.  Plan B, and C and D  Horsey likened the cartels to the relatively few big business winners of the pandemic, such as online retail giant Amazon, using their scale, dexterity and deep pockets to adapt quickly to changing market conditions.  ""They have supply chains that are very sophisticated but also multiply redundant. And that means that border closures and so on, they can find ways around that. They've got a Plan B and a Plan C and a Plan D,"" he said.  ""So, they have multiple different routes that they're constantly testing with test shipments and constantly innovating and constantly keeping lots of options open so that if their main preferred channel fails, they've got lots of other options. And that works very well for COVID.""  The cartels’ penchant for innovation looks to be paying off.  Since the string of large busts earlier this year, Horsey said the cartels have started shifting more of their shipments out of Myanmar from northern Shan to the state's east and south. He said there were also early signs that they have started shipping much more ice out of Myanmar through the country's far western Rakhine state, taking advantage of its coastline to reach markets via the Bay of Bengal.  The UNODC says seizures of precursor shipments to Myanmar over the past few years also show the cartels tweaking their meth recipes by replacing or supplementing ephedrine and its like with a mix of other chemicals including sodium and benzyl cyanide, yet more proof of their flexibility.  Most of the chemicals come from neighboring China.  On Myanmar's side of the border, experts say a patchwork of militias and warlords in command of virtually autonomous fiefdoms helps make the frontier more sieve than wall.  That, too, helps the cartels evade the worst of the border restrictions brought on by the pandemic, said Tom Kramer, a Myanmar-based researcher for the Transnational Institute who studies the nexus of the country's drug trade and ethnic conflicts.  ""These illegal routes are still there, and what the government has been controlling of course is the formal trade routes,"" he said.  Considering the bulk of some of the shipments, he suspects many of them cross formal checkpoints as well but slip through thanks to rampant corruption.  ""There's so much money involved, and people can always find different ways of course of getting stuff into the country. The borders are so porous it would be very hard to control them,"" he said, even under lockdown.  Market share  Douglas, of the UNODC, said the relative ease with which the cartels in Myanmar can continue to access precursors during the pandemic may even help them gain market share over competitors farther afield who source more of their chemicals by sea and air, where supply chains have frayed most.  ""They're using the moment in front of them very effectively,"" he said.  ""They never had a problem maintaining production. They had huge chemical stockpiles in place and continuing access to chemicals to ship in to production points in the Triangle, and they kept production at very high levels during the pandemic, and they've essentially just continued pumping that supply out."""

Trump the United States has actually grown more and more to resemble a developing nation.  As it happens, the onset of the pandemic tore the mask off all of the rot that had been festering just below the surface of U.S. politics and society. Donald J. Trump, backed by his Republican Party, is the very face of this decline, which manifests itself in five epic failures.  ADVERTISEMENT  Failure 1: The great giveaway to the rich  The first reason that the United States is rapidly transforming itself into a developing nation is that its President has made one particularly well-calculated move: He has been able to harness the rapacious greed that is at the heart of Republican politics and simultaneously trample on the tepid moderation that is inherent in Democratic politics.  This had already fully manifested itself prior to the extraordinary fiscal interventions related to the pandemic. Soon after Trump took office in 2017, the United States already embarked on a course of fiscal profligacy.  It successfully enacted tax cuts that baked trillion-dollar deficits into the U.S. economy for as far as the eye can see.  As a consequence, U.S. federal debt has become unsustainable without the Fed’s printing press — which has pushed past the limits of rational monetary policy.  ADVERTISEMENT  More and more, the United States’ fiscal and monetary accounts have come to resemble those of poorly managed developing nations.  Instead of following long-accepted socio-economic practices, President Trump uses lies and illusion to create a febrile web of illicitness — part oligarchy, part plutocracy and part kleptocracy — that is characteristic of so many developing nations.  Living from paycheck to paycheck  ADVERTISEMENT  This has manifested itself more and more in income disparities that leave the vast majority of Americans barely able to hang on from paycheck to paycheck, while a privileged few reap the rewards of a system rigged in their favor — again a characteristic of developing nations.  In fact, if the United States were a developing nation and did not play a central role in the governance of the world’s multilateral institutions, it surely would have come under scrutiny by the International Monetary Fund for pursuing policies and practices that have in the past forced intervention.  ADVERTISEMENT  Failure 2: Police it like it’s Baghdad  This past summer, the United States was literally torn apart by racial strife that often resulted in rioting. The root cause of this strife was the pervasive level of systemic poverty that besets so many Americans living in inner cities.  But if poverty was the cause, an out-of-control police force, facile in the use of strongarm tactics, was the spark. Simply, the United States’ inner-city police forces often stop just short of the tactics used by police in many developing countries.  ADVERTISEMENT  Forget for a moment that African Americans are 2.8 times more likely to be killed by a policeman than an American of European lineage. The reality is that American cities are being subjected to a form of policing that cannot be found in any other developed country in the world.  Supporting police brutality  And, here’s the kicker. President Trump, with broad support from his Republican party, comes down squarely on the side of police brutality.  More importantly, Trump has managed to cadge together an extra-legal police force from units connected to the Department of Homeland Security, which for various reasons seems doggedly loyal to the President.  ADVERTISEMENT  Under his “law and order” mantra, the most lawless of U.S. Presidents mimics the actions of tinpot dictators cracking down on civil unrest in places like Azerbaijan or Cambodia.  Failure 3: A failing U.S. healthcare system  And then there’s the Trump Administration’s handling of COVID 19. Suffice to say that President Trump presides over a nation reeling from the physical, emotional and economic trauma of a raging pandemic by virtue of promoting snake oil — in this case hydroxychloroquine.  But aside from the President’s mindless antics, the coronavirus has unmasked a new reality for all Americans to see. The so-called “greatest health care system in the world” is proving to be every bit as inefficient and ineffective as health care systems in the world’s poorest countries.  ADVERTISEMENT  Despite all the vast amounts of money spent, the U.S. health care system leaves millions of Americans unserved or underserved.  One need only look at the substantially higher COVID 19 death rates among people of color in the United States’ largest cities. It constitutes a callous disregard for human life that aligns more closely with Kinshasa than with Berlin, Paris or even Beijing.  President Trump has not only failed utterly to take the steps necessary to repair the system, which he had so stridently promised in the last Presidential election, he has use the office of the President to chip away at key elements of the existing system.  Gutting the Affordable Care Act  Amazingly, he is in the courts trying to eliminate coverage for pre-existing conditions, a popular facet of the Affordable Care Act that he promised to protect.  ADVERTISEMENT  Again and again, while doing nothing to improve the plight of the United States’ disenfranchised, the President callously focused on tearing the system further apart.  Meanwhile, as in so many developing nations, wealthy Americans are completely unfazed. They have access to some of the world’s best research hospitals.  Failure 4: The extraction economy  The United States’ National Weather Service is currently predicting the possibility of approximately 20 named storms coming ashore in the United States this hurricane season.  ADVERTISEMENT  Such a violent hurricane season does not come as a surprise to anyone who closely follows the impact of global warming on the U.S. ecosystem.  Devastation from climate events, whether brush fires in California, heat waves in the Southwest, inundations in states bordering the Gulf of Mexico and tornadoes sweeping through the Southeast, has become a staple of U.S. news reports.  Death and physical deprivation have become commonplace — with victims of climate change largely left to fend for themselves.  So far, 2020 is on track to become the hottest year on record in the United States, with dozens of U.S. cities setting all-time records for high temperatures. But then, nine of the 10 hottest years on record globally have occurred in the past ten years.  ADVERTISEMENT  Denying the undeniable  There is no longer much ambiguity in these weather patterns. Nor is there any ambiguity in the statistics that measure them. They dovetail precisely with the direst of climate predictions.  And yet, the current President of the United States, with the full backing of the Republican Party, denies climate change and presses forward in promoting the unrestricted extraction and use of fossil fuels.  Within the Trump Administration, environmental problems are not confined to climate change. Since taking office, the Administration has orchestrated a systematic gutting of environmental regulation overall.  Favoring extraction industries every step of the way, Trump — again with the full backing of the Republican Party — has placed the country’s water systems, wetlands and wilderness areas at extreme risk.  ADVERTISEMENT  It puts in place an environmental infrastructure common to developing rather than developed nations.  This pattern of denial and deceit puts the United States on track to increase rather than reduce its dependence upon natural resource development, making the United States a target for all the corruption that extraction industries bring with them.  The United States aside, environmental degradation at the hands of extraction industries is a characteristic common in many developing nations, which base their ongoing development on the exploitation of their natural resources.  Failure 5: Crumble in the infrastructure jumble  Extraction is one side of the coin. The other side is the state of the United States’ infrastructure.  As is the case in so many developing nations, U.S. infrastructure has been widely neglected, despite President Trump’s extravagant campaign promises in the last election.  The lack of adequate infrastructure became most evident with recent storms — Hurricane Isaias in the northeast and the derechos in the Midwest — when above-ground power grids were devastated along with crops.  Few if any developed nations maintain above-ground power grids as the United States still does.  And the decrepit state of the U.S. electrical grid does not even address the jumble of problems with crumbling roads, bridges, rail lines and waterways.  Maintaining a sound infrastructure is a collective national endeavor. It is therefore especially telling — and tragic — that any sense of nationhood has been totally abandoned by President Trump and his Republican cohort in the U.S. Congress in favor of prosperity for the privileged few.  Instead of pouring precious federal resources into national restoration, money in the form of tax cuts is channeled to a new made-by-Trump kleptocracy overseen by legions of lobbyists.  Corruption in Washington  Corruption in Washington, D.C. is akin to the kinds of corruption one finds in places like Lagos or Kabul — albeit on a more sophisticated level.  Instead of foreign entities bribing local officials as happens in developing nations, U.S. companies bribe U.S. officials in the U.S. federal capital city, as well as state capitals.  In the meantime, the United States’ crumbling infrastructure looks more and more like what one would find in other developing countries.  The transformation is underway  The five epic failures of the contemporary United States under the Trump regime are:  1. Out-of-control U.S. fiscal and monetary policies  2. The rise of the police state  3. An inadequate and ineffective health care system  4. A rapidly degrading environment and  5. A deteriorating infrastructure.  These failures are also among the classic characteristics of a developing nation. It cannot satisfy any American, regardless of partisan stripe, that they constitute five epic failures for the Trump Administration.  Failure 6? Shredding democracy  These five epic failures are bad enough. But they would exclude one more characteristic of developing countries that actually represents the Trump Administration’s biggest failure — or rather deliberate act of brazenness: It is Donald Trump’s assault on democracy itself.  The fact is that the President seeks to put in place a form of government that is no longer anchored in the basic principles of democracy. It has become detached from the tenets that shape duly elected governments in other developed nations.  Like despots in so many developing countries, Trump governs more and more by decree in the form of executive orders.

""India is privileged to be able to serve the world by producing 70 per cent of the global vaccines and being trusted as the pharmacy of the world"", he added.  Addressing the 8th East Asia Summit Economic Ministers' Meeting (EAS-EMM) through a video conference on August 28, Goyal welcomed the initiatives of ASEAN to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and the establishment of the ASEAN COVID-19 Response Fund. The member countries of ASEAN are Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Goyal said that 'Acting East' is now a central element in India's Indo-Pacific vision. ""India wants to see a strong, unified and prosperous ASEAN playing a central role in the emerging dynamics of the Indo-Pacific as it contributes to India's prosperity and security as well. We see a great deal of convergence between India's vision for the Indo-pacific and the ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific,"" he said.  In addition to India and ASEAN, economic Ministers from Australia, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and the United States were part of virtual EAS-EMM conference.  Goyal also called for the restoration of the functionality of the appellate dispute resolution body of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and expressed India's willingness to partner with all countries to ensure fair, transparent and balanced trading systems, and to enhance connectivity, for national, regional and global economic growth.  ""India supports the reform of the WTO while preserving the centrality, core values and fundamental principles of the WTO, including special and differential treatment for the developing countries"", he said.  Later, a joint statement signed by all the 18 participating economic ministers acknowledged that the COVID-19 global pandemic has created unprecedented challenges that have caused not only loss of lives but also economic downturn for most countries around the world. The ministers underscored the importance of further strengthening regional economic cooperation, and resolved to take actions aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the pandemic on global and regional trade and investment, ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability and restoring business confidence in the region, the joint statement said. The EAS-EMM meet also underscored the importance of strengthening regional supply chains to make them resilient and less vulnerable to shocks and to advance sustainable economic growth. ""The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to promote trade and investment, minimize disruptions to trade and global supply chains and facilitate supply chain connectivity, including for essential goods such as medical supplies, medicines, including vaccines, food, commodities and other essential supplies and services in the region"", the joint statement said.  The ministers also welcomed the increasing trade and strong investment performance among the EAS economies, with the combined nominal GDP reaching $ 51.6 trillion in 2019, an increase by 4.1 per cent from the previous year. The ASEAN merchandise trade with non-ASEAN EAS participating countries amounted to $ 1.3 trillion in 2019, accounting for 48.1 per cent of ASEAN's total trade while Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) reached to $ 61.2 billion, representing 38.1 per cent of ASEAN's total FDI inflows, signifying the importance of the economic engagement between EAS participating nations.

Trump the United States has actually grown more and more to resemble a developing nation.  As it happens, the onset of the pandemic tore the mask off all of the rot that had been festering just below the surface of U.S. politics and society. Donald J. Trump, backed by his Republican Party, is the very face of this decline, which manifests itself in five epic failures.  Advertisement:  Failure 1: The great giveaway to the rich  The first reason that the United States is rapidly transforming itself into a developing nation is that its President has made one particularly well-calculated move: He has been able to harness the rapacious greed that is at the heart of Republican politics and simultaneously trample on the tepid moderation that is inherent in Democratic politics.  This had already fully manifested itself prior to the extraordinary fiscal interventions related to the pandemic. Soon after Trump took office in 2017, the United States already embarked on a course of fiscal profligacy.  Advertisement:  It successfully enacted tax cuts that baked trillion-dollar deficits into the U.S. economy for as far as the eye can see.  As a consequence, U.S. federal debt has become unsustainable without the Fed's printing press — which has pushed past the limits of rational monetary policy.  More and more, the United States' fiscal and monetary accounts have come to resemble those of poorly managed developing nations.  Advertisement:  Instead of following long-accepted socio-economic practices, President Trump uses lies and illusion to create a febrile web of illicitness — part oligarchy, part plutocracy and part kleptocracy — that is characteristic of so many developing nations.  Living from paycheck to paycheck  Advertisement:  This has manifested itself more and more in income disparities that leave the vast majority of Americans barely able to hang on from paycheck to paycheck, while a privileged few reap the rewards of a system rigged in their favor — again a characteristic of developing nations.  In fact, if the United States were a developing nation and did not play a central role in the governance of the world's multilateral institutions, it surely would have come under scrutiny by the International Monetary Fund for pursuing policies and practices that have in the past forced intervention.  Failure 2: Police it like it's Baghdad  Advertisement:  This past summer, the United States was literally torn apart by racial strife that often resulted in rioting. The root cause of this strife was the pervasive level of systemic poverty that besets so many Americans living in inner cities.  But if poverty was the cause, an out-of-control police force, facile in the use of strongarm tactics, was the spark. Simply, the United States' inner-city police forces often stop just short of the tactics used by police in many developing countries.  Forget for a moment that African Americans are 2.8 times more likely to be killed by a policeman than an American of European lineage. The reality is that American cities are being subjected to a form of policing that cannot be found in any other developed country in the world.  Advertisement:  Supporting police brutality  And, here's the kicker. President Trump, with broad support from his Republican party, comes down squarely on the side of police brutality.  More importantly, Trump has managed to cadge together an extra-legal police force from units connected to the Department of Homeland Security, which for various reasons seems doggedly loyal to the President.  Under his ""law and order"" mantra, the most lawless of U.S. Presidents mimics the actions of tinpot dictators cracking down on civil unrest in places like Azerbaijan or Cambodia.  Advertisement:  Failure 3: A failing U.S. healthcare system  And then there's the Trump Administration's handling of COVID 19. Suffice to say that President Trump presides over a nation reeling from the physical, emotional and economic trauma of a raging pandemic by virtue of promoting snake oil — in this case hydroxychloroquine.  But aside from the President's mindless antics, the coronavirus has unmasked a new reality for all Americans to see. The so-called ""greatest health care system in the world"" is proving to be every bit as inefficient and ineffective as health care systems in the world's poorest countries.  Despite all the vast amounts of money spent, the U.S. health care system leaves millions of Americans unserved or underserved.  Advertisement:  One need only look at the substantially higher COVID 19 death rates among people of color in the United States' largest cities. It constitutes a callous disregard for human life that aligns more closely with Kinshasa than with Berlin, Paris or even Beijing.  President Trump has not only failed utterly to take the steps necessary to repair the system, which he had so stridently promised in the last Presidential election, he has use the office of the President to chip away at key elements of the existing system.  Gutting the Affordable Care Act  Amazingly, he is in the courts trying to eliminate coverage for pre-existing conditions, a popular facet of the Affordable Care Act that he promised to protect.  Advertisement:  Again and again, while doing nothing to improve the plight of the United States' disenfranchised, the President callously focused on tearing the system further apart.  Meanwhile, as in so many developing nations, wealthy Americans are completely unfazed. They have access to some of the world's best research hospitals.  Failure 4: The extraction economy  The United States' National Weather Service is currently predicting the possibility of approximately 20 named storms coming ashore in the United States this hurricane season.  Such a violent hurricane season does not come as a surprise to anyone who closely follows the impact of global warming on the U.S. ecosystem.  Devastation from climate events, whether brush fires in California, heat waves in the Southwest, inundations in states bordering the Gulf of Mexico and tornadoes sweeping through the Southeast, has become a staple of U.S. news reports.  Death and physical deprivation have become commonplace — with victims of climate change largely left to fend for themselves.  So far, 2020 is on track to become the hottest year on record in the United States, with dozens of U.S. cities setting all-time records for high temperatures. But then, nine of the 10 hottest years on record globally have occurred in the past ten years.  Denying the undeniable  There is no longer much ambiguity in these weather patterns. Nor is there any ambiguity in the statistics that measure them. They dovetail precisely with the direst of climate predictions.  And yet, the current President of the United States, with the full backing of the Republican Party, denies climate change and presses forward in promoting the unrestricted extraction and use of fossil fuels.  Within the Trump Administration, environmental problems are not confined to climate change. Since taking office, the Administration has orchestrated a systematic gutting of environmental regulation overall.  Favoring extraction industries every step of the way, Trump — again with the full backing of the Republican Party — has placed the country's water systems, wetlands and wilderness areas at extreme risk.  It puts in place an environmental infrastructure common to developing rather than developed nations.  This pattern of denial and deceit puts the United States on track to increase rather than reduce its dependence upon natural resource development, making the United States a target for all the corruption that extraction industries bring with them.  The United States aside, environmental degradation at the hands of extraction industries is a characteristic common in many developing nations, which base their ongoing development on the exploitation of their natural resources.  Failure 5: Crumble in the infrastructure jumble  Extraction is one side of the coin. The other side is the state of the United States' infrastructure.  As is the case in so many developing nations, U.S. infrastructure has been widely neglected, despite President Trump's extravagant campaign promises in the last election.  The lack of adequate infrastructure became most evident with recent storms — Hurricane Isaias in the northeast and the derechos in the Midwest — when above-ground power grids were devastated along with crops.  Few if any developed nations maintain above-ground power grids as the United States still does.  And the decrepit state of the U.S. electrical grid does not even address the jumble of problems with crumbling roads, bridges, rail lines and waterways.  Maintaining a sound infrastructure is a collective national endeavor. It is therefore especially telling — and tragic — that any sense of nationhood has been totally abandoned by President Trump and his Republican cohort in the U.S. Congress in favor of prosperity for the privileged few.  Instead of pouring precious federal resources into national restoration, money in the form of tax cuts is channeled to a new made-by-Trump kleptocracy overseen by legions of lobbyists.  Corruption in Washington  Corruption in Washington, D.C. is akin to the kinds of corruption one finds in places like Lagos or Kabul — albeit on a more sophisticated level.  Instead of foreign entities bribing local officials as happens in developing nations, U.S. companies bribe U.S. officials in the U.S. federal capital city, as well as state capitals.  In the meantime, the United States' crumbling infrastructure looks more and more like what one would find in other developing countries.  The transformation is underway  The five epic failures of the contemporary United States under the Trump regime are:  1. Out-of-control U.S. fiscal and monetary policies  2. The rise of the police state  3. An inadequate and ineffective health care system  4. A rapidly degrading environment and  5. A deteriorating infrastructure.  These failures are also among the classic characteristics of a developing nation. It cannot satisfy any American, regardless of partisan stripe, that they constitute five epic failures for the Trump Administration.  Failure 6? Shredding democracy  These five epic failures are bad enough. But they would exclude one more characteristic of developing countries that actually represents the Trump Administration's biggest failure — or rather deliberate act of brazenness: It is Donald Trump's assault on democracy itself.  The fact is that the President seeks to put in place a form of government that is no longer anchored in the basic principles of democracy. It has become detached from the tenets that shape duly elected governments in other developed nations.  Like despots in so many developing countries, Trump governs more and more by decree in the form of executive orders. In so doing, he bypasses almost entirely the people's elected representatives in the Congress, which itself has grown increasingly dysfunctional.  Attacking the election  And as the next presidential election approaches, Trump busies himself casting doubt on its legitimacy and throws up impediments within the U.S. Postal Service that are aimed at suppressing the vote, a tactic common in the most corrupt developing nations.  In fact, the polarization that one currently sees in U.S. politics and society, which is stoked to a fever pitch each and every day by a President determined to hold onto power at any cost, inches the United States toward a potentially cataclysmic level of civil strife, the contours of which already became evident this past summer.  And yet, a large cross-section of the U.S. electorate seems content to tag along for this ride in reverse toward a Great Leader — the very notion the founding father of the United States wanted to avoid.

However, some are concerned about the quality of the vaccines and that they are being used to gain political leverage.  Beijing is so confident in its homegrown inoculations that authorities have been administering vaccines for more than a month before clinical studies conclude, authorities revealed this week.  People deemed to be at higher risk of infection, such as border officials and state-owned enterprise employees working overseas, have received jabs after the government approved them for emergency use, according to state media. Soon, transport and service workers are also expected to be vaccinated.  “Giving untested vaccines means that there is no guarantee that they are going to work, so people could wrongly assume that they are inoculated when they are not,” said Nicholas Thomas, a health security expert and professor at the City University of Hong Kong. “In doing so, they could engage in behaviour that has a higher risk....[and] unwittingly put other people at risk.”  “The reason why vaccines go through phase 3 trials is to reduce the short and long-term risk to the individual,” he said. “Giving vaccine shots without this knowledge places individuals at significant personal risk.”  The Chinese government has provided sparse details on which vaccines are being given to people, and how many have been vaccinated, leading to concerns participation may be forced and not voluntary.  Last week, Papua New Guinea cancelled a flight from China filled with arriving passengers believed to have received a coronavirus vaccine over worries of the unknown health impact to the local population.  In general, “it’s better for a community if there’s more people vaccinated, so there’s less risk of an outbreak of Covid,” said Ben Cowling, division head of epidemiology and biostatistics at Hong Kong University’s School of Public Health. “At the same time, just having some vaccinated people wouldn’t be enough to mean that social distancing could be relaxed.”  Story continues  Governments are under increasing pressure to find a lasting solution for the devastating pandemic that has swept the world, infecting nearly 25 million and killing more than 830,000. Authorities are also keen to get economies back on track as quarantine measures, though effective in containing the virus, are beginning to impact growth.  “Covid is causing economic damage every week, every month, so the sooner we can start using vaccines, the better,” said Mr Cowling.  For China, there are additional benefits. Coming up with a successful vaccine would help to deflect anger at home and abroad over its pandemic cover-up, while delivering a blow to US Donald Trump’s “warp-speed” plans for a vaccine. Competition is heating up as well with Russia.  The Chinese government “sees science and technology as tools of national greatness,” said Yangyang Cheng, a scientist and postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University.  Winning the vaccine race would underscore government propaganda about how “it’s really a hostile world out there, and we, as in the Chinese people, have to rely on ourselves”.  It would also give China a new tool for diplomacy and potentially bring more allies into the fold. Indeed Beijing has already vowed “to give priority” to a number of Southeast Asian nations – the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam – if it develops a vaccine.  Canada, engaged in a longstanding diplomatic spat with Beijing, had to halt plans to partner in late stage clinical trials as vaccine doses, stalled in Chinese customs, never even arrived.  An engineer looks at monkey kidney cells as he makes a test on an experimental vaccine for the coronavirus - AFP  Whether the world will trust a Chinese vaccine remains to be seen.  China doesn’t have a great track record. Rushed exports of medical equipment and protective gear this year have turned out to be faulty. The country has also before been plagued with a number of health and food safety scandals, including expired vaccines and tainted baby formula that sickened 300,000 infants and killed at least six in 2008.  If early inoculations in China end up failing, experts say that could impact global public confidence in the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines in general.  While drug regulators have the power to decide whether or not to approve a Chinese vaccine for use in their own countries, they could come under pressure to fast-track a successful candidate on the market, regardless of who developed the treatment.  Countries, though, that China has agreed to conduct advanced tests with include Brazil, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Peru, Morocco, where regulatory hurdles for vaccines to become available may be less stringent than in Western countries like the US or UK.  Still, experts are optimistic with so many vaccine candidates in advanced testing, which could eventually yield a few options. Over time, it may also emerge that some vaccines are better suited for certain parts of the population; for instance, one type of vaccine could be more effective or suitable for children versus adults, said Mr Cowling.  While results of phase three trials won’t be available for another few months, early orders for vaccines are already coming in as nations seek to secure access for their citizens.  “The vaccine development process is like a marathon,” said Mr Cowling. “Some vaccines are nearing the end of the journey, but it’s unclear if they will finish. Some of these vaccines may not pan out; hopefully they will.”  While the coronavirus “does represent a significant threat to humanity,” infections can be controlled with social distancing and other preventative protocols, said Mr Thomas. “It is just that these have economic and political costs.”  “The urgency narrative being put out by Chinese, Russian and American officials is more about national prestige and avoiding such costs than about the comprehensive testing of a new vaccine.”"

En Asia habitan dos tercios del total de los existentes en todo el mundo. Varias organizaciones denuncian que mientras muchos ciudadanos permanecían en sus casas para tratar de contener la cadena de contagios, algunos Gobiernos y empresas aprovecharon la situación para llevar a cabo campañas militares, usurpar tierras, revocar derechos ancestrales y debilitar las leyes de protección medioambiental. Todo ello sin encontrar apenas resistencia.  Signe Leth, asesora de la ONG Grupo Internacional de Trabajo sobre Asuntos Indígenas (IWGIA por sus siglas en inglés) explica que la llegada del coronavirus ha golpeado a los pueblos indígenas de muchas maneras. ""En primer lugar, ha impactado a su seguridad alimentaria y modos de vida, ya que estos meses no han podido atender sus granjas. Se trata de una situación delicada teniendo en cuenta que muchos de ellos son migrantes con trabajos no regulados, por lo que miles de personas han perdido sus empleos y tienen que subsistir con pocos recursos"".  Leth asegura que se están otorgando licencias para proyectos de desarrollo a gran escala en tierras forestales y que las operaciones mineras continúan en algunos países. Los defensores de los derechos de las personas indígenas sufren cada vez más ataques debido al bloqueo y las restricciones de movimiento: son más fáciles de encontrar y no pueden movilizar sus redes de apoyo, por lo que “temen por su seguridad”, explica. Además, se están llevando a cabo “desalojos de las tierras forestales y realizando campañas militares, sin importar que estas iniciativas no tengan nada que ver con la lucha contra la pandemia”, afirma.  Camboya  Eang Vuthy, director ejecutivo de Equitable Cambodia, una ONG local camboyana, explica que en las comunidades de la provincia de Ratanakiri, al noreste de este país, están extremadamente enfadadas con la compañía de caucho vietnamita Hoang Anh Gia Lai (HAGL) que ha arrasado dos montañas sagradas, humedales, áreas de caza tradicionales y cementerios durante la cuarentena.  Vuthy afirma que la empresa “no ha respetado los numerosos acuerdos alcanzados, incluido el acuerdo general de 2014, que establece un compromiso para no limpiar más tierras comunitarias, ni el acuerdo de 2017 que declaró áreas específicas acordadas para ser devueltas (incluidas las áreas que habían sido despejadas en marzo)”.  La llegada de la covid-19 también ha afectado a las comunidades indígenas en el acceso a los centros de salud  Las comunidades están exigiendo a HAGL que detenga de inmediato sus operaciones y acepte devolver todos los terrenos, incluidas las áreas recientemente despejadas, para que puedan volver a dejar crecer los bosques, sus montañas espirituales y la agricultura de subsistencia. Las comunidades también están exigiendo a la compañía que les proporcione cartas firmadas de su presidente para tener alguna garantía de que no volverá a suceder.  Estos terrenos son muy importantes para la cultura de estos pueblos, ya que, como dice Vuthy, sus creencias se derivan de sus relaciones con la tierra. Ellos creen en los espíritus que habitan los bosques y las montañas. Ahora que la compañía ha despejado la zona, no tienen lugar para rezar y creen que puede haber consecuencias por haberlas dejado usurpar.  Filipinas  El caso de Camboya no es único. Una de las minorías que más afectada se ha visto es la de los Dumagat-Remontados, un pueblo que habita desde hace siglos los frondosos bosques de la cordillera de la Sierra Madre, en la isla filipina de Luzón, y cuyas tierras ancestrales están ahora amenazadas. Flores-Obanil, coordinadora regional para Asia de la Coalición por los Derechos Humanos en el Desarrollo, cuenta que en este área es donde el Gobierno filipino planea construir la presa Kaliwa, a pesar de las preocupaciones ambientales y la oposición de las comunidades indígenas locales que temen ser desplazadas y perder sus medios de vida.  En 2009 este pueblo, con el apoyo de la Alianza Salvar Sierra Madre (SSMNA), había conseguido detener con éxito su construcción a través de una campaña pública y acciones legales. Pero bajo la presidencia de Rodrigo Duterte, el proyecto obtuvo el año pasado un dudoso certificado de cumplimiento ambiental y un préstamo bancario de 211,2 millones de dólares (unos 185 millones de euros). Desde entonces, la militarización en la zona ha aumentado y los líderes comunitarios han sido acusados de pertenecer a un grupo rebelde.  Con la llegada del coronavirus y las medidas de contención, “ha aumentado la presencia de la policía y de los militares en el lugar, mientras que la población residente no se ha podido mover libremente en sus tierras”, dice Flores-Obanil. En marzo, un miembro de la comunidad Dumagat-Remontado fue detenido y maltratado físicamente mientras estaba bajo custodia, un penúltimo episodio en un contexto de violencia continua, añade.  Una multitud de agricultores y pescadores indígenas realiza una protesta ""muerta"" para dramatizar su difícil situación en Quezon City (Filipinas) el 10 de diciembre de 2012 en Manila, la capital. Los indígenas dumagat, agricultores y pescadores viajaron 350 kilómetros a pie desde la región norteña de Casiguran, Aurora, en un esfuerzo por detener la construcción de una zona de procesamiento de exportaciones. Los agricultores dijeron que el proyecto había desplazado a 3.000 familias y eliminado sus fuentes de sustento. Dondi Tawatao Getty Images  El Gobierno también ha seguido emitiendo permisos de minería, y algunas comunidades han denunciado un aumento en las actividades mineras ilegales, realizadas especialmente por compañías chinas, según alertó Alyansa Tigil Mina (ATM), una coalición nacional de organizaciones que luchan contra la extracción destructiva a gran escala en el país.  Myanmar e Indonesia  Leth, de IWGIA, asegura que el Gobierno de Myanmar también ha visto en la pandemia una oportunidad para intensificar su represión contra los pueblos indígenas y otros grupos étnicos. “Los enfrentamientos feroces, incluidos los bombardeos indiscriminados y los ataques aéreos han provocado la pérdida de vidas de varios civiles”, asegura ella.  Desde su organización han recibido denuncias sobre la tala de bosques en Indonesia. Sin embargo, argumenta que uno de los mayores desafíos durante la pandemia ha sido obtener información de las áreas más remotas que están fuera de la red, aunque temen “una situación realmente mala” de la que actualmente no pueden obtener suficiente información.  Desgraciadamente, la llegada de la covid-19 también ha afectado a las comunidades indígenas en el acceso a los centros de salud, ya que muchas viven en áreas incomunicadas y no tienen acceso a algunas instalaciones, al apoyo del Gobierno ni a información en su propio idioma sobre cómo protegerse del virus, poniendo a su población en mayor riesgo.  Las organizaciones mencionadas están tratando de ayudar a los pueblos indígenas para que conozcan sus derechos, puedan documentar cualquier violación de los derechos humanos que ocurra y protestar por estas violaciones.

They were looking for animal hosts from which the epidemic had sprung.  In brief The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has laid bare the urgent need for a better understanding of how viruses jump from animals to people, a process called zoonotic spillover. There are many hurdles a virus must get over to leap species to species, including finding a way to unlock receptors on the new host’s cell surfaces and learning how to replicate itself in those cells without alerting the host’s immune system. Scientists are working to better understand the molecular steps that viruses take to overcome these barriers. They hope to integrate that information with ecological surveillance of emerging zoonotic viruses to spot pathogens that could trigger a new outbreak.  Although they didn’t manage to do that, they found something else: a new species of ebolavirus, the genus of viruses that cause Ebola diseases. The new virus—the sixth in the genus to be identified—infects two bat species that roost in people’s homes in the Bombali region of Sierra Leone. The following year, the new virus popped up in the same bat species in Guinea and Kenya.  Although researchers don’t yet know whether this new Bombali virus infects people, or whether it would cause disease if it did, lab experiments suggest that it could. The protein that helps the Bombali virus, and the other five ebolaviruses, enter host cells binds to the correct receptor in lab-grown human cells to gain access to them, explains Tracey Goldstein, associate director of the One Health Institute at the University of California, Davis, who led the team that identified the new virus.  Support nonprofit science journalism  C&EN has made this story and all of its coverage of the coronavirus epidemic freely available during the outbreak to keep the public informed. To support us:  Donate Join Subscribe  The Bombali virus highlights an enigma for scientists monitoring the viruses that jump from wildlife to humans, a process called zoonotic spillover. Ebolaviruses, and many other viruses circulating in bats and other animals, “have that ability to spill over all the time,” Goldstein says. “But they don’t spill over all the time.”  The consequences can be significant when they do, as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic now gripping the world. Scientists are still trying to piece together exactly how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, spilled over from bats into humans. But, in general, whether or not a virus can make such a species leap and trigger an outbreak like COVID-19 depends on a complex dance between factors relating to ecology, viral evolution, and human immunity. Researchers are beginning to tease apart how these factors interact and how the molecular changes that viruses accrue as they evolve underlie that process. “That way, as we find viruses in wildlife, we can start to prioritize ones that look like they have the potential to be bad actors, and we can figure out where to focus to prevent a spillover event,” says Jonathan Epstein, vice president for science and outreach at EcoHealth Alliance.  Running the gauntlet  Scientists don’t know exactly how many different viruses exist in nature, but one recent estimate suggests that as many as 1.67 million still-unknown viruses infect mammals and birds, and that between 631,000 and 827,000 of those have the potential to make a zoonotic leap (Science 2018, DOI: 10.1126/science.aap7463). Even with estimating how many viruses could jump, “we have got no idea how many viruses out there are infecting humans,” says Raina Plowright, a disease ecologist and wildlife veterinarian at Montana State University. Novel viral infections might show up as encephalitis, a respiratory illness, or other symptoms in people living in remote parts of the world and never get diagnosed due to a lack of resources, Plowright says. As a result, many probably go unnoticed.  Regardless of the actual number, though, viruses that manage to jump species are rare—especially ones that do so successfully enough to cause large epidemics. “There are actually really effective barriers to zoonotic transmission,” Plowright says.  Spillover hurdles Many factors have to align for a virus to successfully jump from a host species to humans. Credit: Adapted from Nat. Rev. Microbiol  Many events must align for a virus to spill over and become established in people. First, the original host—the species that serves as the virus’s so-called reservoir—needs to rub elbows with people at a time when it is shedding enough virus for people to get exposed to a significant amount. Next, the virus has to be equipped with the molecular machinery to enter human cells. Specifically, it needs the right protein to bind to a receptor on a human cell, allowing it to slip inside. Then, it has to be able to replicate and to infect other cells, and while doing so, evade the human immune system.  Different viruses balance these factors differently, but the big-picture process is the same. “It’s the everyday, mundane, humdrum thing viruses do: they get into the cells, and they replicate, and they get out of the cells, and they infect [further cells],” says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney. Along the way, they might pick up mutations or new genes that could help them make their way in another species.  As we find viruses in wildlife, we can start to prioritize ones that look like they have the potential to be bad actors and we can figure out where to focus to prevent a spillover event. Jonathan Epstein, vice president for science and outreach, EcoHealth Alliance  Yet most potential spillover events “go nowhere,” Holmes says. In most cases, even if virus particles can infect a new host’s cells, they are effectively dead on arrival because they can’t replicate. Or, they might not make people ill, or might cause a small, local outbreak and then just burn themselves out because they lack the oomph to pass from person to person. “Very occasionally, they go ballistic,” like with SARS-CoV-2, Holmes says.  Spillover isn’t a lightning strike event—a once-and-done moment. It’s a lot less linear. Rather than considering a virus as a single entity with a static genome, it’s more accurate to think of “a whole spectrum of viruses that are variations on a theme,” Epstein says. “They’re a bunch of cousins that are genetically almost identical but different in ways that could really impact their ability to make that jump from their natural animal reservoir into people.” Virologists often refer to a collection of viruses—infecting one person or growing in one petri dish—as a swarm, says Michael Farzan, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute. Some members of the swarm might have genetic features that make them especially good at getting a grip on host receptors, or at efficiently replicating or transmitting from host to host.  Mastering that first spillover step—receptor binding—is paramount, because without it, the jump can’t happen. “The degree to which a virus uses the [host] receptor is a very good indicator for the degree to which the virus infects a particular species,” Farzan says.  Once a virus breaches that entry barrier, it must interact with dozens to hundreds of proteins in its new host to complete its life cycle while evading notice by the host’s immune system. Variation in even a single amino acid in its proteins can make or break the virus’s success.  Researchers know less about how viruses bypass these intracellular hurdles in a new host, but some viruses are yielding clues. For example, changes to influenza A proteins called PB1-F1, which induce inflammation in the host, affect a flu strain’s virulence. Meanwhile, HIV secured its jump to humans in part through wily tricks for evading our innate immune response. Because HIV sets up shop in a human host for the long term, Farzan says, integrating its genetic material into human DNA, HIV had to evolve a bag of sophisticated tricks to duck host-cell proteins called viral restriction factors that block viral replication.  Under pressure  For a virus to make a zoonotic jump, it must somehow pick up the equipment to infect a new host’s cells before it even comes across that host. But what pushes a virus to do that? Research on coronaviruses suggests that pressure from the virus’s current host can nudge it to accrue mutations that allow it to hijack hosts it hasn’t met yet.  Credit: Cell  For example, researchers have observed a molecular duel between some coronaviruses and bats. Coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2002–3 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, and SARS-CoV-2, use spike proteins on their surfaces to unlock receptors called ACE2 on the cells of their hosts. Several studies over the past few years have found that some of these bat coronaviruses can infect human cells, presumably because their spike proteins carry the right key to get into the cells via ACE2. More recently, bat biologist Zhengli Shi at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and her team looked at a bat species that carries these viruses (J. Virol. 2020, DOI: 10.1128/JVI.00902-20). They found that several of the viruses’ spike proteins can bind to human ACE2, supporting earlier work. But they also found that the bats themselves carried many different versions of ACE2. Some of the amino acid differences between the versions affected how well the virus spike protein could bind them.  The work suggests that evolutionary pressure acts on bat ACE2, pushing it to pick up mutations that prevent the coronaviruses’ spike proteins from binding. Those changes in turn put pressure on the viruses to pick up spike protein mutations to counter the bats’ ACE2 mutations. That pressure can select for mutations that coincidentally equip the virus to infect a new host.  “It’s pretty apparent that there’s this evolutionary arms race between the receptor binding domain and ACE2 that’s happening within the bats themselves,” says Tyler Starr, a postdoc in the lab of genome scientist Jesse Bloom at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. “Whatever it’s doing is ratcheting up this evolution and sometimes spitting out things that can bind potentially to many different ACE2s, including ours.”  In the case of the 2002–3 SARS outbreak, researchers could pinpoint viral sequences from bats and palm civets to conclude that SARS-CoV-1 likely jumped from bats to civets before reaching humans and infecting more than 8,000 people. Studies of the virus suggested that it had acquired two mutations that allowed it to bind tightly to human ACE2 and propagate within our cells, Farzan says. Both mutations were in the receptor binding domanin (RBD), which is the part of the spike protein that directly interacts with ACE2.  In 2004, the year after the epidemic ended, a handful of people in Guangzhou again caught the virus from a civet but only got mildly ill. When Farzan’s team sequenced the virus taken from one such person, they found that it carried only one of those two key mutations and consequently bound human ACE2 less tightly (EMBO J. 2005, DOI: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600640). “Apparently, it was as a consequence not as transmissible,” Farzan says. “From there, we can make some guesses as to what was necessary for it to do really well in humans.”  Following SARS-CoV-2  In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the species route to humans is much less certain. Early on, researchers speculated that the virus may have jumped from horseshoe bats to pangolins before infecting humans. More recent thinking suggests that pangolins simply became infected the same way that humans did. Authors of a study published in July argued that the virus didn’t need to exchange genes in another animal after bats to allow it to infect humans, though that possibility can’t be ruled out (Nat. Microbiol. 2020, DOI: 10.1038/s41564-020-0771-4). “I’m not sure we will ever know what happened,” Montana State’s Plowright says.  Researchers speculate that two changes to the genome of a bat-infecting coronavirus made SARS-CoV-2 an effective human pathogen. The first was to adapt the RBD so it could bind to the human ACE. The second was to create a site in the virus’s spike protein that could be cleaved by a human cell enzyme called furin, which helps get the virus ready to enter a cell. Such furin-binding sites are present in other coronaviruses but don’t generally appear in ones like SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.  Global spread Before March 1, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 strains that carried the G614 variant in the spike protein were rare outside of Europe, but by the end of that month the variant had spread around the world. Pie charts shows the prevalance of the D614 and G614 variants in patients in different geographical areas. Size of pie indicates relative sampling levels in region. Credit: Cell  So far, though, efforts to find other mutations that might power the virus’s pandemic prowess have largely fallen short. Starr, Bloom, and their colleagues set out to mutate every position in the 201-amino-acid RBD one by one and then examine how each mutation affects the protein’s folding pattern and capacity to bind ACE2. They found that the region has a high tolerance for mutations. “It can handle a high number of mutations and do its job just fine,” Starr says. The team even found dozens of mutations that boosted the RBD’s ability to bind the ACE2 receptor, but the virus seems to have not adopted any of them (Cell 2020, DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.012).  The degree to which a virus uses the [host] receptor is a very good indicator for the degree to which the virus infects a particular species. Michael Farzan, immunologist, Scripps Research Institute  That finding suggests that the virus functions effectively with the binding affinity it has, and that there’s no strong selective pressure pushing for mutations that might increase it, Starr says. He wonders if that’s because the virus is tearing through a population that has never encountered it and has no immune defenses against it. “Right now, the virus has basically found a buffet table of susceptible [hosts].”  Advertisement  As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, one virus mutation does appear to have become a permanent feature of SARS-CoV-2’s genome. Researchers collecting virus samples from infected patients have been sequencing viral genomes and analyzing the strains spreading in different parts of the world. They have found that one mutation, a change from an aspartic acid (D614) to a glycine (G614), is now present in the majority of SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences. People infected with strains carrying this mutation tend to shed more virus than those infected with strains that don’t, hinting that this mutation may make the virus more infectious (Cell 2020, DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.043). Farzan’s team has conducted cell studies with the lab-made viruses carrying SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and found that the mutation causes the virus to more readily infect human cells, perhaps because there are more spike proteins on the virus’s surface (bioRxiv 2020, DOI: 10.1101/2020.06.12.148726v1). The data from those studies have not yet been peer reviewed.  However, how much this mutation is ratcheting up the virus’s potency—and how exactly it affects its spread—is still up for debate. Holmes says that although the shift likely does make the virus somewhat more transmissible, it probably spread so widely because it made its appearance in Europe early in the pandemic and got swept up in the transmission chain in Italy, where so many people were infected in a short amount of time and then traveled across the globe. “It’s the epidemiology that has driven that, not the evolution of the virus,” he says.  Spotting the next jump  Researchers still have much to learn about SARS-CoV-2’s zoonotic leap—and how to prevent viral spillover in general. For the past decade, UC Davis’s Goldstein, EcoHealth Alliance’s Epstein, and other collaborators working on PREDICT have collected samples from wildlife and people in areas where outbreak risks are high. Shi and her colleagues at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, working with PREDICT, reported in 2018 that people living close to caves where bats carrying different SARS coronaviruses live have antibodies to such coronaviruses, though it’s impossible to pinpoint which viruses in particular (Virol. Sin. 2018, DOI: 10.1007/s12250-018-0012-7).  Credit: Jaber Belkhiria/University of California, Davis  Goldstein and her colleagues now plan to go back to blood samples that they’ve collected from people in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Myanmar, to see if people in communities that have high exposure to bats have more such antibodies than people in communities that don’t. By identifying regions where exposure is high, researchers can study how people and animals come into contact and try to pinpoint behaviors that would decrease it, Goldstein says.  There are actually really effective barriers to zoonotic transmission. Raina Plowright, disease ecologist and wildlife veterinarian, Montana State University  Using humans as a filter is a powerful way to narrow in on especially concerning regions where potentially zoonotic viruses are endemic, Plowright says. She is also taking another approach: looking for viruses with spillover potential by looking at the microbes themselves. She is collaborating with researchers at Cornell University to screen viruses collected through surveillance projects for zoonotic potential by running lab tests to determine whether they can infect human cells. The team has been running the screen on henipavirus samples collected in Bangladesh and Australia and are now beginning to test coronaviruses. “Of course, there’s a lot more to zoonotic infection than a cell culture,” she says. But the screen provides a way to identify potentially dangerous viruses for further study.  Ultimately, however, monitoring for spillover will require scientists to gain a much better ecological picture of the regions in which potentially dangerous viruses are endemic. When PREDICT sunsets this year, other efforts such as the Global Virome Project, a 10-year collaboration launched in 2018, will continue crucial surveillance work. But what researchers most need to develop, Plowright says, is a long-term understanding of ecological changes in hot spots.  For example, she is working with collaborators in Australia who have spent 24 years tracking a bat population that carries henipaviruses, which tend to be highly pathogenic when they infect people. The bats used to be almost entirely nomadic, traveling among patches of native forest, but now as critical habitat is disappearing, they are moving into areas where people live.  Understanding the ecological dynamics of the zoonosis for these viruses could point to specific remedies like replanting forests. They could also reveal circumstances, such as stress, that may cause bats that carry potentially dangerous viruses to shed them more readily.  “The problem is, we don’t have data on so many of these events,” Plowright says. As people encroach on wilderness areas with lots of biodiversity, they expose themselves to the biggest requirement for zoonotic spillover—proximity to animal carriers of potentially dangerous viruses. By learning more about the ecological role in zoonosis, scientists could find new ways to slow or prevent spillover. In terms of spending resources to help us spot the next virus that could make a species jump and spark a pandemic, she says, “That’s where I would invest.”"

It’s what my own Irish-Catholic ancestors did when they moved around the block a century ago, around the time of the Spanish Flu. My great-grandfather was a milkman for Hood. My grandfather and his seven siblings grew up on West London Street, where my Aunt Dot lived until she died. He and three of his brothers served in World War II, and they returned home to raise their own families within the same 1-mile radius: marrying at the Sacred Heart Church, sending their kids to the Sacred Heart School. That generation is gone now. So is the school; so is the church.  LOWELL — Simply Khmer restaurant is on the scruffier side of the Spaghettiville Bridge in a neighborhood edged with cracked sidewalks and weed-tufted pavement. This is not the downtown Lowell of converted mills and cobblestone streets. It is a land of overpasses and alleys, of auto-body shops and vacant lots. But here on Lincoln Street, Sam Eang Lee and his wife, Denise Ban, oversee the Cambodian restaurant equivalent of Cheers.  Advertisement  I don’t know who lives in their houses anymore, but I still know the streets. And 100 years later, Lee is staking his hopes on the same block.  “I wake up and think every day: I can’t believe I’m here,” he says. He was born in Cambodia in 1969; by 1974, Lee and his parents, brother, and sister had planned to pack up to flee the Khmer Rouge, walking for days through the woods to a refugee camp on the edge of Thailand. His father, Lee Eang, was killed during that desperate time for plotting the escape. His brother starved to death. Like so many others, Lee ultimately came to Lowell as a teenager to build a new life. The city, with its long history as an immigrant destination, was one of the places designated by the Office of Refugee Settlement for Cambodians given asylum.  Advertisement  Ban is also a refugee. The pair met as young adults when Lee’s mother, a wedding planner, helped to organize Ban’s sister’s nuptials.  “I was afraid of girls. I’d never talked to girls before, so I wrote her poems and love songs. And I guess she fell for it,” Lee says with a laugh.  The pair found success with Simply Khmer after operating a flashier downtown restaurant, Angkor Kingdom, with a bigger bar scene. This restaurant is compact and sleek, with glossy menus and a separate area for product displays. Andrew Zimmern visited in 2011 for his TV show “Bizarre Foods,” which put it on the national map. In the COVID-19 era, their website features photos of servers getting their temperatures taken, as well as a merchandise section with fish sauces and branded face masks.  From left: Xavier Eang Lee, Denise Ban, and Sam Eang Lee at their Simply Khmer restaurant in Lowell. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff  Son Xavier Eang Lee, 24, moved home from New York City in 2019 to offer extra support. His marketing savvy and creation of an online ordering system (plus an on-point Instagram presence) has helped his parents reach a new generation of customers. He never planned it this way when studying at Hofstra University, but now he hopes to take over the business.  “I love it, even though it’s taken me a minute to admit it to myself. It was intense for me. At first, I thought: I’m going to move to the city, enjoy my life, and try to do all these things. But the only person looking out for me and my family is myself,” he says.  Advertisement  He wants to promote a line of Cambodian sauces and frozen foods to an audience far beyond Lowell. He also wants to pivot to a quick-service food model, perhaps more marketable during a pandemic and beyond.  “I want to be here for the Cambodian people, and the new waves of Portuguese and Central Americans and African-Americans and Indians who enjoy our food. I hear horror story after horror story, but they have been here for us,” he says.  His father trained him well at the wok, he says, but also instilled a zeal for customer service — something that he says accounts for the restaurant’s wide appeal.  Hot wings at Simply Khmer restaurant. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff  “My father would always say: ‘You can be a good cook, but are you a good cleaner?’” Xavier says. The restaurant is immaculate, especially now, with signs about masks and reminders to stay 6 feet apart. The family has added a patio with spacious picnic tables and plants.  There, friends gather over sticky-sweet chicken wings and fragrant kuy-tiew, or noodle soup. Martin Huq flags me down to sing the restaurant’s praises from a corner bench.  “I’m taking care of my elderly mom, and I feel like they keep things clean and safe,” he says. “I’m here once or twice a week.“  One table over, pals Vanna Howard and Vannak Theng catch up on city news.  Advertisement  Simply Khmer's nam bahn chok. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff  “We come here to have something to remind you of home: the smell of fresh vegetables, fruits, herbs,” says Howard, a refugee from Cambodia who moved to Lowell from Revere in 1991. Now she’s a candidate for state representative from the 17th Middlesex District.  They’re eating nom bahn chok, the restaurant’s signature soup. It’s a gustatory kaleidoscope of lemongrass, kaffir lime, fermented fish, and garlic with vermicelli served in a glassy broth, tinted greenish from turmeric. It is electric and cleansing, like drinking herbaceous sunlight.      Food is Lee’s bridge between past and future, the one language he could always speak.  “I started school in eighth grade. I couldn’t count. I would fall asleep, head on my desk,” he recalls. “I found one person from Cambodia who had been here longer than me and spoke English. The teacher let us sit next to each other. Whatever the teacher said, he’d translate,” he recalls.  He continued on to vocational school and found work in auto body shops and as a landscaper, but he longed to cook. Ban, meanwhile, was a self-proclaimed “teacher’s pet” and a checkers champion. She went on to work in accounting.  “I skipped a few grades,” she says. “I think that gave me the advantage over the people who were making fun of me. After that, they didn’t make fun of me. They wanted to be my friend.”  When Lee said he wanted to cook again after his first restaurant closed, Ban was confident they had the money for the modest Lincoln Street storefront. Rent was just $1,200. They took a chance, and for years, Simply Khmer was a success.  Advertisement  A customer picked up food at Simply Khmer. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff  “It was the perfect balance between being a community restaurant where the Khmer community liked to go, but it also had certain elements that a non-Cambodian would feel comfortable in,” says George Chigas, an associate teaching professor of Cambodian language and culture at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. His wife came to Lowell as a Cambodian refugee.  The restaurant’s fortunes matched Lowell’s own: The mill city has always been a haven for immigrants like my own family a century ago, and it was on the upswing after years of tumult. But until the late 1990s, Chigas says, race relations were tense.  “In the 1980s, the population was very new, coming from refugee camps along the Thai-Cambodian border. Many hadn’t been outside of that world, and it was a violent world. Things were settled with guns and knives,” Chigas says.  Chigas identifies a turning point in 1999, when Lowell was named an All-America City by the National Civic League, a designation he attributes to the city’s strong Cambodian culture. The same year, Chanrithy Uong was elected to the Lowell City Council. He was the first Cambodian-American elected to a council post nationwide.  “Cambodia drove Lowell’s new cultural economy. Cambodian culture was a real asset,” Chigas says. Simply Khmer was able to capitalize on that.  “The city has dramatically changed from the ‘80s. It’s grown,” Ban says. “It’s a melting pot. It’s where the [Southeast Asian] Water Festival is happening. Nobody has water festivals in the US except Lowell. It’s a big deal.”  Xavier Eang Lee served customers at Simply Khmer's outside dining area. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff  Just the same, the family relocated from Lowell to Harvard for the schools when Xavier was growing up, and he says it was difficult to convince friends to visit his old hometown. On the other hand, the family has been criticized for catering to a Western audience by having an English-language menu, selling products, and focusing on explaining dishes to new guests instead of keeping their heads down and cooking.  “But I don’t want people to feel intimidated,” Xavier says. “I grew up with Caucasian people, and getting them to come to my restaurant was hard. Then I [also] heard, ‘Are you only trying to cater to lighter skin?’ We get that a lot. I say to them: ‘We are here because ... we love what we do and want to share it with a wider audience,” he says.  COVID-19 changed the family’s outlook. They scrapped dine-in service, which comprised 75 percent of their business; now, they rely on takeout. Ban received several loans, and she’s working on securing more funds, including a grant from the city.  “I have backed-up bills that I have to clear up from rent to electricity to everything else. My head is still in the water ... but I’m still breathing,” she says.  The Durkin Bridge is a block away from the restaurant. It’s named for my Irish-Catholic family on West London Street. I stood on this block in 2016 when Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito christened the sign and praised my grandfather’s family for their legacy, with those four brothers who served in World War II at once. They and their other siblings went on to modest, hard-working lives that encapsulated the postwar American dream: printers, milkmen, salesmen.  During the dedication, I thought about how much time had passed. My grandparents were dead, their church had closed, and new construction in various hues of beige had replaced my mom’s parochial school.  Now, contemplating my own fragrant bowl of nom bahn chok in the shadow of their bridge, I see a car pull up out front. The driver looks familiar. It’s my mom’s cousin, now a foreign language teacher at Lowell High School, ducking in for takeout. He greets Theng and Howard — they know one another, of course, because that’s how Lowell is.  “The city is growing. We’re hard-working folks. We know how to survive, given the situation we’re in, coming here, making a life for ourselves, bettering ourselves,” says Theng, who spent her early years at a refugee camp in Thailand before coming to the United States. She’s now a teacher at the Robinson School across the Merrimack River in Centralville.

KOLs were therefore better placed to monetise their work at a time when brands were hesitant to spend on marketing.  KOLs in China, like Tao Liang (left) and Leaf Greener, have fared better than their Western equivalents.

This dance isn’t played out in China to nearly the same extent.  However, Bliss does warn against judging Western influencers too quickly, saying that, while they may not be raking in the dollars like their Chinese peers, they are growing their follower counts every day.  “We just did a survey among the American Gen Z and it showed influencers are even more 2 zxsd relevant now than they were before the pandemic,” she says. “Yes, brands have been pulling back marketing budgets, but that doesn’t mean influencer culture is waning – streaming services have seen cutbacks in ad spending, even though we all know they’re booming right now.”  Advertisement  Black Lives Matter Finally, in an effort to stay relevant and appeal to an increasingly woke generation, many influencers have turned to activism, particularly in the US with the rise of– and this is something we will doubtless see more of as the November presidential election nears.

Goyal co-chaired the 17th Asean-India Economic (AEM) Ministers’ Consultations held on Saturday via videoconference in a bid to maintain social distancing norms because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.  He highlighted that the free trade agreement (FTA) has to be “mutually beneficial” and expressed the need to strengthen the rules of origin provisions, work towards removal of non-tariff barriers and provide better market access, a ministry statement said on Sunday.  Goyal asked for an early review of the Asean-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), as the trade pact is hurting India’s interest, particularly because of the violation of rules of origin clauses.  Also read: PM Modi lauds India’s farmers for higher crop production amid Covid crisis  India is concerned and wants to review FTAs, as several Chinese goods are dumped in its markets through a third country with which the nation has an agreement, a government official said requesting anonymity.  The review is necessary, as many items enter Indian markets taking advantage of Asean-India FTA. Imports at reduced or zero duty put the domestic industry at a major disadvantage, the official said.  Goyal used the Asean ministerial forum to reiterate India’s consistent position that the review of the FTA has been inordinately delayed. He asked for a closer engagement ahead of the Asean-India Leaders’ Summit scheduled to be held in November and to start the full review before the end of this year, the commerce ministry said in the statement.  Goyal co-chaired the meeting with Tran Tuan Anh, Vietnam’s minister of industry and trade.  A report of the Asean India Business Council (AIBC) was also presented in the meeting.  It also recommended a review of the AITIGA for mutual benefit. The ministers from India and Asean countries instructed the officials to start the discussions to determine the scope of the review at the earliest to make the FTA more user-friendly for businesses.  Sangita Reddy, co-chair of AIBC (India), said the nation and Asean should develop a road map for collaboration in healthcare and pharmaceuticals sectors along with exchange of knowledge and digital connectivity. “She shared that special incentives for Indian pharmaceutical companies should be introduced for setting up plants in dedicated Asean zones,” the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) said in a statement.  The industry association is the Indian secretariat of AIBC.  The meeting was attended by the trade ministers of all the 10 Asean countries such as Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.  The ministers reaffirmed their commitment to take collective actions in mitigating the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and resolved to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability and resilient supply chain connectivity, particularly the unimpeded flow of essential goods and medicines in the region, in compliance with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, the statement said.  AIBC also recommended elimination of non- tariff measures to enable seamless movement of goods and services, FICCI said in the statement.  It proposed the introduction of a business travel card which would facilitate business travel between India and Asean countries with a minimum 90-day validity.  ."

After Vietnam, India and Bangladesh, alternative sourcing options of choice are still largely countries in Asia, including Taiwan, which enjoyed overwhelming preference as a sourcing market among US-based respondents.  The survey named ""Evolution of Sourcing in 2020"" was conducted in July 2020 by Hong Kong-based QIMA.  It is said to be drawn on input from more than 200 businesses around the world across a variety of consumer product segments and built on previous QIMA research.  The report analyses the evolution of global sourcing in response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, US-China trade tensions and other disruptions to global supply chains.  It says China is down, but not out.  Although China still takes the crown for global sourcing, its dominance is noticeably less dramatic compared to previous years, especially in industries such as textile and apparel, where supplier portfolio diversification has been a priority for a while now, the QIMA report said.  Nevertheless, 75 per cent of the respondents globally named China among their top three sourcing geographies, with 55 per cent reporting that Chinese suppliers accounted for over half the buying volumes in the first half of the year.  Vietnam continues with its upward trend, luring in Western buyers as an alternative to China.  Consistently ranking among China's regional competitors, Vietnam continues to reap the most benefits of the continued mass exodus of Western buyers from China, with 40 per cent of the EU respondents and almost as many US brands included Vietnam among their top sourcing regions.  This is in tune with Western brands not venturing too far from China.  The US and the EU brands are exploring sourcing options closer to home but are more likely to near-shore rather than re-shore.  For US-based companies, sourcing destinations closer to their home country continue to grow steadily, with the popularity of Latin and South America almost doubling compared with last year.  Meanwhile, the EU brands are increasingly turning to Turkey as a near-shoring destination as the latter was named among the top three sourcing regions by 30 per cent of EU respondents.  Diversification is on the top of the mind for global brands, but there are some noticeable nuances between regions.  The US brands are by far most likely to diversify sourcing, with 95 per cent of US-based respondents reporting plans to the effect, likely due to the pandemic and worsening geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing.  On the other hand, European buyers are not as ready to walk away from China, with only about half of the EU-based respondents reporting plans to seek suppliers elsewhere.  While China remains a key sourcing region, named among the top three sourcing geographies by three-quarters of respondents globally, its dominance is less dramatic compared to the findings of QIMA sourcing surveys of previous years.  In 2018-2019, more than 95 per cent of the respondents had listed China among their top 31 sourcing destinations.  The increasing share of the other in-demand sourcing regions in Asia, particularly Vietnam, India and Bangladesh, as well as home regions, is another way in which the long-term trend towards sourcing diversification is making itself known.  Among the ""other"" sourcing countries, Taiwan emerged an indisputable leader, reported by 6 per cent of respondents among their top three sourcing grounds, notably overwhelmingly among respondents headquartered in the US.  The other notable entries included, in descending order of popularity, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, South Korea, South Africa, Japan and Pakistan.  Comparing the latest survey data against the findings of QIMA sourcing surveys conducted in 2019 and 2018 provides a glimpse into the evolution of the top three sourcing regions as indicated by the US and EU buyers.  Despite the continued importance of China for buyers based on both sides of the Atlantic, its popularity has been inching downward, even among EU-based buyers, which have been less affected by the fallout of the US-China trade war in recent years.  Vietnam consistently remains among China's regional competitors reaping the most benefits of the continued exodus of Western buyers from China.  Some 40 per cent of EU respondents and almost as many US-based ones included Vietnam among their top sourcing regions.  Re-shoring and near-shoring have remained on the rise for US-based companies, with the growing popularity of the home region, and increased sourcing from Latin and South America.  In the rankings of top sourcing countries, the latter region almost doubled in popularity in the first six months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.  Meanwhile, respondents headquartered in the EU do not appear to be stepping up full-fledged re-shoring but are increasingly turning to Turkey as a near-shoring destination.  Some 30 per cent of the EU respondents named Turkey among their top three sourcing regions.  While reliance on China has decreased across the board, it remains a top-priority sourcing region for promotional products while toy businesses were more likely to view Chinese suppliers as a priority, compared to 2019.  In addition to Vietnam, traditionally a footwear powerhouse, brands and retailers continued to view Bangladesh as an important sourcing market for footwear.  Textile and apparel businesses have continued diversifying their supplier portfolio, with an ever-lowering reliance on China and a more even distribution between overseas sourcing in Asia and near-shoring.  While near-shoring remains more popular than re-shoring, textile and apparel companies were more likely to buy from US and EU-based suppliers in 2020 compared to last year.  Outside of being a go-to sourcing market for textiles, India is increasingly viewed as an important sourcing region by buyers from different industries.  ""Work orders are coming back gradually. The inflow of work orders is better in August than in June and July,"" said Mohammad Abdus Salam, acting president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), over the phone.  But most of the work orders are leftover orders of April and May when the retailers and brands cancelled the work orders, he said.  Salam, however, said it was difficult to pinpoint what would happen in the near future because the rate of unemployment and inflation was increasing in the Western world. ""So we are cautiously optimistic,"" he said.  Between 1 and 22 August, garment export from Bangladesh increased 45.8 per cent year-on-year to $2.4 billion, according to data from BGMEA."

""Giving vaccine shots without this knowledge places individuals at significant personal risk.""  The Chinese government has provided sparse details on which vaccines are being given to people, and how many have been vaccinated, leading to concerns participation may be forced and not voluntary.  Last week, Papua New Guinea cancelled a flight from China filled with arriving passengers believed to have received a coronavirus vaccine over worries of the unknown health impact to the local population.  In general, ""it's better for a community if there's more people vaccinated, so there's less risk of an outbreak of Covid,"" said Ben Cowling, division head of epidemiology and biostatistics at Hong Kong University's School of Public Health. ""At the same time, just having some vaccinated people wouldn't be enough to mean that social distancing could be relaxed.""  Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP The global race to find a coronavirus vaccine is heating up, with China now claiming to be in pole position.  Governments are under increasing pressure to find a lasting solution for the pandemic that has killed more than 840,000 people.  For China, coming up with a successful vaccine would help to deflect anger at home and abroad over its pandemic cover-up, while delivering a blow to Donald Trump's ""warp-speed"" plans for a vaccine. Competition is heating up as well with Russia.  The Chinese government ""sees science and technology as tools of national greatness,"" said Yangyang Cheng, a scientist at Cornell University.  Winning the vaccine race would underscore government propaganda about how ""it's really a hostile world out there, and we, as in the Chinese people, have to rely on ourselves"".  It would also give China a new tool for diplomacy and potentially bring more allies into the fold.  Beijing has already vowed ""to give priority"" to a number of South-east Asian nations – the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam – if it develops a vaccine.  Whether the world will trust a Chinese vaccine remains to be seen.  If early inoculations in China end up failing, experts say that could impact global public confidence in the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines in general.  While drug regulators have the power to decide whether or not to approve a Chinese vaccine for use in their own countries, they could come under pressure to fast-track a successful candidate on the market, regardless of who developed the treatment."

I used this technique at Microsoft, and I still use it today. I ask these questions literally every week about COVID-19.  Here they are: Who has dealt with this problem well? And what can we learn from them?  They seem like obvious questions, but sometimes it's surprisingly hard to find the answers—especially when it comes to global health. There are low- and middle-income countries that have made huge leaps in, for example, delivering vaccines or ending malnutrition. But anyone who wants to identify those countries, find out how they did it, and apply the lessons in their own country would have their work cut out for them.  In sports, every coach is able to study the most successful teams and figure out what they’re doing well. There’s no reason that things should be any different when the goal is preventing childhood deaths instead of scoring touchdowns.  That’s why I was eager to be part of a global effort to fill the gap. Over the past three years, health experts and organizations from countries at every income level (including the Gates Foundation) have come together to find out who has made the most progress on certain health problems, identify what made them so successful, and help others put these lessons into action.  The result of all this effort—the Exemplars in Global Health program—launched earlier this year. If you want to know which countries have made the most progress with limited resources, Exemplars is a great place to start.  For now, Exemplars focuses on five areas: under-five mortality; vaccine delivery; the role of community health workers; epidemic preparedness and response; and childhood stunting (the reduction in physical and mental development caused by poor nutrition). The team will be adding other areas, including newborn and maternal mortality, family planning, maternal anemia, and primary health care systems.  The Exemplars team has scoured the world for the best performers and worked with experts in those countries to find out what worked so well. For example, they identified seven countries that have excelled at reducing the number of children who die before their fifth birthday: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Nepal, Peru, Rwanda, and Senegal. The Exemplars website has a profile of each country, detailing insights from its work that other countries could learn from.  Bangladesh—whose childhood mortality rate dropped 56 percent between 2000 and 2015—used data, research, and testing especially well, and empowered women to make decisions about their children’s health. Peru, which achieved roughly the same decline as Bangladesh, conducted local studies to identify interventions that might suit specific communities. All seven countries built up strong community health systems and made specific efforts to close the equity gap by reaching the poorest people.  Of course, not all lessons can be applied in the same way everywhere. What works in one country may not work exactly the same way in another. And it is not always obvious how to implement big changes in national health systems, which are very complex and require a lot of coordination among the government, the private sector, and non-profits.  “We’re not interested in simply getting the information out there—we want to help drive change.” “We’re not interested in simply getting the information out there—we want to help drive change.”  Recognizing these challenges, the Exemplars program is much more than a website. There is also a community of global and in-country experts ready to help countries make the case for investing in the most effective programs and figure out how to adapt the lessons to their particular needs. We’re not interested in simply getting the information out there—we want to help drive change.  Our hope is to connect with decisionmakers: people who work in the governments of low- and middle-income countries, at development agencies like America’s USAID and the World Bank, and at organizations that implement health programs. Exemplars is all about figuring out how to improve health care based on evidence of what works. It will help governments use time and money more efficiently—and with the COVID-19 pandemic, there has never been a greater need to get the most impact out of every dollar spent.  I’m grateful to all the people in governments, academia, and non-profits who made the Exemplars program possible. We all started out with one goal in mind: to accelerate the progress in improving health, so that the poorest countries don't have 20 times the childhood death rate of the richest ones. I think Exemplars is a great resource that will spread success stories so even countries with very little money can benefit. And that will, ultimately, save lives."

Nonetheless, he has emphasized that Singaporeans should exercise vigilance, and continue to observe the safe distancing rules and travel requirements. Travellers who have remained in Brunei or New Zealand for the past consecutive 14 days prior to their visit to Singapore will not have to serve a stay-home notice upon arrival. However, they are required to undergo a test at the airport and will be allowed to go about their activities after receiving a negative test result. In addition, they will also need to apply for an Air Travel Pass between seven and 30 days before their intended date of arrival. Meanwhile, students studying overseas at institutions which do not offer distance learning will also be allowed to travel from 1 September 2020. The stay-home notice period for travellers from low-risk places such as Australia (excluding Victoria state), Macau, mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia will be shortened from the current 14 days to seven days, which can be served at their place of residence or hotels instead of dedicated facilities from 1 September 2020.  Japan and Myanmar Agree to Reopen Borders for Long-term Residents  On 24 August 2020, Toshimitsu Motegi, Foreign Minister of Japan, and Myanmar leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, agreed to reopen borders for expatriates and other long-term residents as soon as early September, relaxing travel restrictions that were imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both parties have also confirmed during the meeting that talks would be sped up to facilitate short-term business travel while taking precautions to curb the spread of the virus. Japan has launched talks with 16 economies, including Myanmar, to resume travel in tandem with the restart of domestic socioeconomic activities. Besides Myanmar, Japan agreed with Cambodia and Laos over the weekend and with Singapore and Malaysia earlier this month to allow reciprocal travel of long-term residents as early as September. Under the arrangements, long-term residents can travel on the condition that they stay at home or at a designated place for 14 days after arrival and take precautions to reduce the risk of infection. Motegi also pledged loans of JPY30 billion (USD283 million) to the Myanmar government as emergency budget support and JPY15 billion to support small and medium-sized firms. The funds came on top of virus-related aid worth over USD30 million that Japan has administered to Myanmar.  Anantara to Rebrand Luxury Resort in Seychelles  Thailand-based Minor Hotels Group has signed a deal to rebrand the Maia Luxury Resort & Spa in Seychelles as the Anantara Maia Seychelles Villas, from September 2020. The resort is located on Mahé, the largest of Seychelles' islands and a short drive from the international airport. Situated between the island's unique granite rocks and Anse Louis Beach, the resort offers 30 secluded private villas, each with a dedicated villa host available 24-hours a day for the duration of the stay. The villas are approximately 250 square-metres in size. Located in the resort's lush gardens, Anantara Spa will be home to three open-air treatment rooms and will offer a wide range of new activities with a dedicated wellness focus for the guests. Bespoke dining options will also be available to the guests. Additional resort facilities include an onsite restaurant, a pool bar, a wine boutique, a main resort swimming pool, a fully-equipped fitness centre, paddle boarding, snorkelling and kayaking. Curation of tours  beyond the resort will also be available. Anantara Maia Seychelles Villas will be the brand's first property in Seychelles and the seventh in the Indian Ocean, joining the two resorts in Sri Lanka, one in Mauritius and three in the Maldives.  New Delhi to Reopen Hotels and Weekly Markets  On 19 August 2020, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (""DDMA"") has approved hotels, restaurants and weekly markets in the city to reopen on a trial basis after being shut for almost five months due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Despite approval, hotels and weekly markets will not open from Thursday as they have to wait for DDMA's order. Detailed standard operating procedures (""SoPs"") for the weekly market will be prepared to maintain and monitor social distancing. Gymnasiums and yoga institutes in the national capital will continue to remain shut. Hotels contribute approximately 8% of the city's Gross Domestic Product and also provide significant employment opportunities. India Ministry of Home Affairs has given permission for hotels, restaurants and hospitality services in the country to resume operations in a phased manner from 8 June 2020, albeit while following the detailed guidelines and SoPs as issued by the government."

However, some are concerned about the quality of the vaccines and that they are being used to gain political leverage.  Beijing is so confident in its homegrown inoculations that authorities have been administering vaccines for more than a month before clinical studies conclude, authorities revealed this week.  This electron microscope file image made available by the US National Institutes of Health shows the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Photo / AP  People deemed to be at higher risk of infection, such as border officials and state-owned enterprise employees working overseas, have received jabs after the government approved them for emergency use, according to state media. Soon, transport and service workers are also expected to be vaccinated.  ""Giving untested vaccines means that there is no guarantee that they are going to work, so people could wrongly assume that they are inoculated when they are not,"" said Nicholas Thomas, a health security expert and professor at the City University of Hong Kong. ""In doing so, they could engage in behaviour that has a higher risk....[and] unwittingly put other people at risk.""  ""The reason why vaccines go through phase 3 trials is to reduce the short and long-term risk to the individual,"" he said. ""Giving vaccine shots without this knowledge places individuals at significant personal risk.""  The Chinese government has provided sparse details on which vaccines are being given to people, and how many have been vaccinated, leading to concerns participation may be forced and not voluntary.  Last week, Papua New Guinea cancelled a flight from China filled with arriving passengers believed to have received a coronavirus vaccine over worries of the unknown health impact to the local population.  In general, ""it's better for a community if there's more people vaccinated, so there's less risk of an outbreak of Covid,"" said Ben Cowling, division head of epidemiology and biostatistics at Hong Kong University's School of Public Health. ""At the same time, just having some vaccinated people wouldn't be enough to mean that social distancing could be relaxed.""  A medical worker performs a Covid-19 test at a centre at Vnukovo airport outside Moscow, Russia. Photo / AP  Governments are under increasing pressure to find a lasting solution for the devastating pandemic that has swept the world, infecting more than 25 million and killing more than 830,000. Authorities are also keen to get economies back on track as quarantine measures, though effective in containing the virus, are beginning to impact growth.  ""Covid is causing economic damage every week, every month, so the sooner we can start using vaccines, the better,"" said Cowling.  For China, there are additional benefits. Coming up with a successful vaccine would help to deflect anger at home and abroad over its pandemic cover-up, while delivering a blow to US Donald Trump's ""warp-speed"" plans for a vaccine. Competition is heating up as well with Russia.  The Chinese government ""sees science and technology as tools of national greatness,"" said Yangyang Cheng, a scientist and postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University.  Winning the vaccine race would underscore government propaganda about how ""it's really a hostile world out there, and we, as in the Chinese people, have to rely on ourselves"".  It would also give China a new tool for diplomacy and potentially bring more allies into the fold. Indeed Beijing has already vowed ""to give priority"" to a number of Southeast Asian nations – the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam – if it develops a vaccine.  Canada, engaged in a longstanding diplomatic spat with Beijing, had to halt plans to partner in late stage clinical trials as vaccine doses, stalled in Chinese customs, never even arrived.  Whether the world will trust a Chinese vaccine remains to be seen.  China doesn't have a great track record. Rushed exports of medical equipment and protective gear this year have turned out to be faulty. The country has also before been plagued with a number of health and food safety scandals, including expired vaccines and tainted baby formula that sickened 300,000 infants and killed at least six in 2008.  If early inoculations in China end up failing, experts say that could impact global public confidence in the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines in general.  While drug regulators have the power to decide whether or not to approve a Chinese vaccine for use in their own countries, they could come under pressure to fast-track a successful candidate on the market, regardless of who developed the treatment.  Countries, though, that China has agreed to conduct advanced tests with include Brazil, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Peru, Morocco, where regulatory hurdles for vaccines to become available may be less stringent than in Western countries like the US or UK.  Still, experts are optimistic with so many vaccine candidates in advanced testing, which could eventually yield a few options. Over time, it may also emerge that some vaccines are better suited for certain parts of the population; for instance, one type of vaccine could be more effective or suitable for children versus adults, said Mr Cowling.  While results of phase three trials won't be available for another few months, early orders for vaccines are already coming in as nations seek to secure access for their citizens.  ""The vaccine development process is like a marathon,"" said Mr Cowling. ""Some vaccines are nearing the end of the journey, but it's unclear if they will finish. Some of these vaccines may not pan out; hopefully they will.""  While the coronavirus ""does represent a significant threat to humanity,"" infections can be controlled with social distancing and other preventative protocols, said Mr Thomas. ""It is just that these have economic and political costs.""  ""The urgency narrative being put out by Chinese, Russian and American officials is more about national prestige and avoiding such costs than about the comprehensive testing of a new vaccine.""  ‌"

In view of this, the United Nations (UN) secretary-general published last week a report entitled ""Covid-19 and Transforming Tourism"". The brief, produced by the Madrid-based UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), is a ground-breaking scrutiny of the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic on tourism worldwide.  ""Tourism is one of the world's most important economic sectors. It employs one in every 10 people on Earth and provides livelihoods to hundreds of millions more,"" stated António Guterres, the UN chief, on the launch of this momentous publication.  With possible declines in global arrivals and receipts from international tourism of 58% to 78% for the whole year, the outlook is dire.  According to the UN, export revenues from tourism could fall by $910 billion to $1.2 trillion (28-37 trillion baht) in 2020 -- equivalent to Indonesia's GDP, for example -- reducing global GDP by 1.5% to 2.8%.  As a result, up to 100 million direct tourism jobs are at risk, many ""in the informal economy or in micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ a high proportion of women and young people"", stressed Mr Guterres.  And this is only half of the story. The UN also warns about the spillover effect: sectors associated with tourism, such as labour-intensive accommodation and food services, provide employment for 144 million workers and are seeing unemployment skyrocket, with disastrous consequences to vulnerable communities.  ""The pandemic is far from over. As cases across the world make clear, we must be ready to act fast to save lives. But it is now also clear that we can take decisive action to protect jobs and safeguard the many benefits tourism delivers,"" stated Zurab Pololikashvili, the UNWTO chief, on Friday.  The UN also alerts about the oversized impact of the current crisis in developing countries, particularly in many Small Island Developing States, where tourism has accounted for as much as 80% of exports, like in the case of the Maldives.  The sudden fall in tourism has also cut off funding for biodiversity conservation, given that around 7% of the pre-Covid-19 global tourism was related to wildlife.  The UN highlights the case of Cambodia (Thailand is not mentioned in this report), where endangered ibis birds were killed for meat in April following the collapse of tourism demand.  ""The impact of Covid-19 on tourism places further pressure on heritage conservation as well as on the cultural and social fabric of communities, particularly for indigenous people and ethnic groups,"" cautions the UN.  Data compiled by the UNWTO indicates that, in response to the pandemic, 90% of the World Heritage Sites and museums closed -- and 13% of museums may never open again.  What can be done?  ""Policy decisions need to be coordinated across borders to face up to a challenge, which does not care about borders […] we can only call on governments to back up strong words with equally strong actions,"" urged Mr Pololikashvili.  In this regard, this UN report highlights the case of Malaysia, a country that has already established its Tourism Recovery Action Council.  The UNWTO believes that domestic tourism is likely to help the sector emerge from the current impasse.  ""We often underestimate the volume of domestic tourism,"" said Sandra Carvão, the UNWTO chief of Market Intelligence and Competitiveness, during an online press briefing joined by the Bangkok Post.  The UN Secretary-General identifies five priority areas to help the tourism sector recover:  1. Mitigate the socio-economic impacts on livelihoods, like in South Korea where, according to the report, tourism employees placed on technical unemployment will receive an allowance of more than 50% of their gross salary.  2. Boost competitiveness and build resilience, with measures like increasing support for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, which form a whopping 80% of tourism enterprises around the world.  3. Advance innovation in tourism, including promotion of investment in digital skills, particularly for workers temporarily without jobs and for job seekers.  In this area, the UN showcases Cambodia again, pointing out how Phnom Penh provided retraining and upskilling programmes for laid-off workers, and announced plans to pay 20% of the minimum wage of hospitality workers.  4. Foster sustainability and green growth to shift towards a resource-efficient and carbon-neutral tourism sector through, for example, increasing investments on renewable energy and smart buildings.  5. Coordination to restart the sector ensuring it works to ease and lift travel restrictions worldwide in a responsible way, ""putting people first"".  Tourism, one of the most dynamic and job intensive sectors, has been hard hit by this devastating pandemic. The challenge is huge, as are the opportunities to make this industry a more sustainable, resilient and inclusive one."

China is leading the major economies in recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and recession. But for a variety of reasons there is unlikely to be a quick “V-shaped” recovery back to the old growth path. Prolonged global weakness plus the U.S.-China trade war mean that exports will not play the same role as they did in the past. The buildup of debt to risky levels also sets limits on the role that investment will play. Furthermore while uncertain at this moment, there is a good chance that people will be more cautious about many activities even after a vaccine is developed, so it is likely that private consumption will be lower than it was on the previous growth path. China can turn all of these factors to its advantage, but it will take an acceleration of reform to do so. Particularly important will be new trade agreements, financial sector reform, and expansion of social services to migrants.  China’s economic growth plummeted from 6.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 to –6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2020—a breath-taking drop in activity. This was the economy’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with most factories, offices, and retail establishments closed for a month. The lockdown, coupled with the recipe for testing, tracing, and isolation, brought the virus under control (recognizing that it will not be fully under control until a reliable vaccine is developed and distributed worldwide). Starting in March, the economy began to bounce back, and in many ways the recovery has been faster in China than it has been in other major countries. But a key question remains—to which growth path is the economy bouncing back?  The next section of this essay examines the immediate recovery of the economy during mid-2020. The remainder of the essay focuses on potential long-term changes occasioned by the pandemic. There is tremendous uncertainty at the moment about the path of both the virus and the economy. But I argue that it is unlikely that China will return to its former growth path. Also, because that path was unsustainable it is not necessarily a bad thing that the growth model will be adjusted. The crisis creates an opportunity to implement reforms that will enhance the welfare of the Chinese people, have spillover benefits for the rest of the world, and make Chinese growth more sustainable.  What are the likely long-term effects of the pandemic on China’s growth model? First, in the short run, China will certainly be less export-dependent. The rest of the world was hit by the virus later than China and thus will recover later, so for the moment there is depressed demand for Chinese exports and they cannot be a leading force for recovery. Also, it is difficult to separate the virus from the U.S. trade war, which is continuing and likely to escalate. Hence, in the future it is likely that there will be less trade and investment back and forth between China and the U.S. China can mitigate the effect of a trade war to some extent by signing new trade and investment agreements with other countries, as it has done recently with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Program. China is likely to be less connected to the U.S. economically, but if it pursues liberalization with partners in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it does not have to be less integrated into the global economy.  A second likely change in the growth model is that it will be less investment-dependent. China has built up very high leverage in its economy, a sign that the big lending spree since the global financial crisis included many bad projects, which now have turned into bad loans that threaten the stability of the financial system. The pandemic increases the risk of a financial crisis because some otherwise sound businesses will go under, leaving more bad debts. It is interesting that China has been very muted in its fiscal and monetary response to the downturn, a reflection of lack of headroom to expand lending. To control these risks, reforms in the financial system are needed to open up financial services to more competition and flexibility of interest rates. The growth of credit will have to be slower than it has been in the recent past, and this means that allocating credit will be important if China is to maintain a healthy growth rate.  Finally, the pandemic has exposed weaknesses in China’s safety net, especially for the nearly 300 million migrant workers, 200 million of whom do not have fair access to public services in health, education, and pensions. China is entering a demographic phase in which the elderly population will increase dramatically while the labor force will shrink. Most of the elderly live in the countryside, often as their grown children work elsewhere. Mobility is constrained by the hukou system as well as by access to healthcare and the portability of pensions. Given what is likely to be a persistent shortfall in demand, this is a good moment to expand public resources for social services and to unify the urban and rural systems.  China’s Uneven Recovery  The initial spread of COVID-19 had a devastating effect on the Chinese economy. Officials suppressed information about the disease for 2–3 weeks in January while, ironically, economic activity continued at a rapid pace. But once the authorities acknowledged the dangerous spread of the disease and locked down Wuhan city and several other cities in Hubei province, the economy ground to a halt. Since this was playing out during Spring Festival, it was easy for factories, schools, and offices to remain closed beyond the normal holiday period.  GDP, which is always reported on a quarterly basis, is a highly imperfect measure of the economy, and in the case of China, there is always suspicion about official numbers. Fortunately, there are growing independent sources of micro-data that can supplement what we know from GDP statistics. These data tell a consistent story of a steep drop in activity in February followed by a gradual recovery beginning in March. For example, the Transportation Congestion Index for 100 cities shows that the drop in car traffic during the Chinese New Year, which is normal, continued on for four weeks after the holiday. In mid-February the index was down 21 percent from the previous year, but by mid-March the gap had narrowed to 11 percent. In mid-February, coal use by five big power groups in the coastal provinces was down to one-third of the pre-virus level, but by end-March, it was back up to two-thirds of the pre-crisis level. However, SMEs did not fare as well. A big data study of SME revenue by the PBC School of Finance at Tsinghua University finds that even at the end of March revenue was down by about 60 percent compared to the previous year.[1]  Using the historical relationship between high-frequency data and official GDP growth numbers, an independent analyst, Yicai Global, uses a variety of indicators to formulate a real-time estimate of GDP growth. According to the Yicai Index, GDP growth was normal in January, but then in February it plummeted to a rate nearly –20 percent compared to that in the previous year. GDP growth was still negative in March, though less so than in February. For the quarter, the index averaged –6.7 percent, similar to the official number of –6.8 percent. In Q2 the Yicai Index showed growth rates of –4.4 percent in April, 0.6 percent in May, and 1.4 percent in June.[2] In other words, China’s economy is gradually returning to positive growth. The official GDP number for Q2, 3.2 percent,[3] is a bit higher than expected based on the micro-data, but it is plausible that this is because so much of the rebound was concentrated in construction.  What comes through from all the data sources is that the recovery is uneven across sectors and firm types (and probably across locations, though it is difficult to determine that in real time). The downturn hit firms in both manufacturing and services. Initially, it seemed that manufacturing would recover first. It was easier to get workers back to factories than back to offices, restaurants, and retail establishments. The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) for manufacturing jumped in March, and China actually had one good month of exports in April, probably because of pent-up demand, the need for medical supplies, and the fact that China was recovering just as other parts of the world economy were falling into recession. In May and June, however, manufacturing was weak, especially exports (see below), whereas the non-manufacturing sectors were recovering. The decline in exports is a “second shock” indicating that during a severe global recession China cannot expect exports to come to its rescue. It will have to rely on domestic demand. The June PMIs saw non-manufacturing (54.4) expanding much more rapidly than manufacturing (50.9).[4]  Manufacturing and services are very broad categories and within each there is sharp differentiation. The auto industry, which caters to domestic demand, is enjoying a mini-boom based on pent-up demand and a reluctance to return to public transport: auto sales in the second quarter were up 10.4 percent from the previous year. Traffic (unfortunately) is back to normal, whereas metro ridership as of May was only 65 percent of the pre-virus levels in Beijing and 73 percent of the pre-virus levels in Shanghai.[5] Travel among provinces and cities by air and rail is down sharply as are entertainment, hotels, and restaurant meals. In contrast, delivery services and construction are booming. The latter reflect both recovery of the housing market (apartment sales are back to normal) as well as the government stimulus aimed at infrastructure projects. Curiously, China has applied much less stimulus than the advanced economies, primarily out of concern for the already high level of debt in the economy.[6] The U.S., Japan, and Germany are all implementing 10 percent or more of GDP in a fiscal stimulus, whereas China is applying half that amount. Still, it is a significant stimulus compared to its 2019 fiscal policy. In addition to loans for infrastructure, China is spending more on healthcare while taking in less tax revenue, so its on-budget deficit will rise significantly this year.  China’s growth rate for the year will be a low, positive number—a combination of the recession in the first half of the year and the recovery in the second half that has been uneven across sectors. As a whole, during the first half China’s GDP contracted 1.6 percent. The June IMF forecast for this year is growth of 1.0 percent.[7] Respected UBS economist Wang Tao predicts a more recent and upbeat forecast of 2.5 percent.[8] At the May National People’s Congress (NPC), the leadership wisely did not set an official target; it is more important to get the virus under control (the recent mini-outbreaks in the Northeast, Beijing, and Xinjiang are reminders that the virus will not be fully controlled until there is a reliable vaccine). The NPC speeches also emphasized the prioritization of employment over GDP growth. At this moment, the forecasts for a low positive number appear to be about right. The IMF also sees a strong rebound into 8.2 percent growth in 2021.[9] Nevertheless, there is huge uncertainty about such estimates because the virus could always come back with a vengeance and/or the severity of the global recession could be more serious than anticipated. The IMF forecast numbers for China are much more positive than its forecasts for the other major economies. The U.S. is looking at an 8 percent decline this year, followed by a tepid rebound to 4.5 percent in 2021.[10] If these numbers are right, by the end of 2021 the Chinese economy will be 10 percent larger than it was during the pre-virus period and the U.S. economy will be 4 percent smaller.  External Economic Relations Shift Away from the U.S.  ​  An important question for China is how the coronavirus will affect its trade and external economic relations. In the short run, China’s trade will decline, and it will not be able to rely on exports to spur its recovery. But a more important question is whether in the longer term China will pursue greater integration or greater isolation with the global economy. In this area, it is impossible to separate the impact of the virus from the U.S.-China trade war. During the two years before the virus hit, the U.S. imposed a 25 percent tariff on increasing categories of imports from China, reaching about half of all imports. China retaliated, though its smaller amounts of imports meant that its tariffs covered less trade. The two sides negotiated a kind of truce that was signed by President Trump and Vice Premier Liu He in mid-January, just when the virus was emerging as a global issue. The U.S. rolled back only a small amount of its tariffs, leaving most in place, but it dropped a planned expansion of the tariffs to new products. China agreed to some structural measures that were already in the works and fully opening investment in autos and financial services. The heart of the deal was an agreement that during 2020 and 2021 China would purchase an additional $200 billion (over 2017 levels) of U.S. goods and services, covering agriculture, manufactures, energy, and services.  From the start, economists were skeptical about the deal as it represented a kind of managed trade rather than an opening of Chinese markets. Furthermore, the amounts were implausible: starting from actual U.S. exports in 2019, it would have required a 40+ percent increase in 2020 and a further 40+ percent increase in 2021.  The trade war and the virus are linked in several ways. First, the short recession in China, combined with the deeper recession in the U.S., made the targets less plausible. In the first six months of 2020 China’s imports from the U.S. were down 4.3 percent compared to the previous year and down 18 percent compared to the benchmark year of 2017. They were at about one-half the level needed to meet the 2020 target. The reason for this is simply the recession. China’s overall imports are down 6 percent compared to last year, and what it is buying from the U.S. is also down.[11] Second, the nature of the global recession arising from the coronavirus makes two of the specific targets in the agreement virtually impossible. China is supposed to import a lot more services from the U.S., and this mainly consists of Chinese tourists and students traveling to the U.S. Their spending on travel, housing, education, and entertainment is an important export for the U.S. But with the closing off of travel routes, visas, entertainment establishments, and universities, the travel of students and tourists will be seriously hampered. Similarly, there will be a sharp drop in the plan to sell $50 billion in energy to China: at current market prices the U.S. industry is cutting back, not looking for export opportunities. Third, anger among Americans about the virus has led to new lows in public opinion about China. Senior administration officials have accused China of deliberately creating and releasing the virus, and blaming China is a key part of President Trump’s campaign strategy. So far, the two sides have found it in their respective interests to maintain that the deal is alive, but it is difficult to see it surviving for two years.  It is common for U.S. analysts of China to assume that there will be some economic de-coupling of the two economies. Furthermore, the nature of the de-coupling will be critical for both sides. China (like other countries) has benefited enormously from integration into the global economy. This year it is taking an important, positive step toward greater integration through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Program (RCEP), a free-trade agreement among the ASEAN countries, China, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. Trade economists estimate that the trade war will reduce world incomes by $301 billion annually and will reduce world trade by nearly $1 trillion annually by 2030 from what they would have been during the pre-Trump policies.[12] But the RCEP adds $209 billion to world incomes, largely offsetting the overall trade war, though not fully for China and the United States. The region rightly sees the RCEP as a big deal: by some measures it is the largest free trade agreement; the first on this scale written largely by and for the developing countries; the first to connect China, Japan, and Korea; and the first to set common rules and low barriers for East Asian trade. It may not be as advanced an agreement as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), but the RCEP has simple, cumulative rules of origin, so East Asian producers will be able to buy most inputs tariff-free from any part of the region. That will be a big boost for supply chains. Even before the RCEP goes into effect, China’s trade has been shifting away from the U.S. toward Southeast Asia. In the first half of 2020 ASEAN moved past both the U.S. and the EU to become China’s largest trading partner.[13] Somewhat remarkably, China-ASEAN trade actually increased in the first half of 2020 compared to the previous year.  The US-China trade war hastened the RCEP by threatening trans-Pacific supply chains. The new agreement is East Asia’s “Plan B”; it will lower trade costs and amplify regional strengths in innovation, high-tech industries, manufacturing, and agricultural and other natural resources. It will help East Asia to recover more rapidly from COVID-19 and become more productive in the long run. Ironically, given the trade war, the RCEP will produce greater benefits than would have been the case without the trade war: if the U.S. is abdicating its traditional free-trade role in the Pacific, then trade liberalization among the remaining economies will be more valuable.  Even though the benefits of the RCEP are real, they are modest compared to the benefits of the CPTPP because the latter requires much deeper reform and opening. In particular, the benefits to the world of China joining the CPTPP will be an estimated $485 billion per year, much of which would accrue to China since it started with a fairly high level of distortions. Premier Li Keqiang has recently spoken of China joining the agreement. That would be a smart move that requires accelerated reform and it would put China squarely at the center of the Asia-Pacific economy, which will continue to be the fastest growing in the world. Given the agreement’s discipline on cross-border data flows, IPR protection, state enterprises, and other issues, it will also produce a heavy lift for China.  Although it seems likely that China’s economic relations will shift away from the U.S. toward other partners, especially in Asia, one aspect of China’s economic relations—the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)—has definitely been set back by the coronavirus. The BRI lacks transparency, but from what we know many of China’s leading clients, especially in Africa, are in debt distress because their GDPs and exports have fallen and they cannot service the debts they have built up from borrowing from China—largely on commercial terms. At least for the next few years, it seems likely that the BRI will proceed on a smaller scale as the borrowing countries cannot afford to take on new debt and China will have trouble subsidizing the program to a greater extent owing to its own financial problems.  Financial Reform is More Important Than Ever  COVID-19 increases the risk of a financial crisis in China and makes financial reform more important than ever. The financial system is bank-dominated, and, in particular, it is dominated by the four state-owned commercial banks. They have done an adequate job of channeling resources to productive activity, as evidenced by 10 percent annual GDP growth for nearly four decades. But there is evidence that the sector has become less efficient over time, probably because the financial challenges have become larger and the banks have not adapted in turn. During the rapid export-growth phase of the 1990s and 2000s it was straightforward to channel resources to exporters and housing construction. Now that growth depends less on an expansion of capital stock and more on productivity and innovation, the task for financial institutions has become more challenging.  The simplest indicator of this changing efficiency of the financial system is the overall leverage in the economy. Take, for example, the debt of firms plus households relative to GDP (leaving aside for the moment local and central government debt). During the ten years before the global financial crisis, this measure of leverage was surprisingly stable. Banks issued a lot of credit for investment and mortgages, and apparently these investments had high returns and generated growth, so the ratio of debt to GDP was stable. After the global financial crisis, however, leverage roughly doubled during a decade, from 110 percent of GDP to 210 percent of GDP.[14] This suggests that a lot of bad investments were financed, but these were investments that did not contribute to growth of the economy. Local and central government debt also grew as a result of the big stimulus program in response to the global financial crisis, taking total leverage in the economy up to near 300 percent of GDP—a number that is not unusual for a developed country but is high for a developing country. With so much credit expansion, there are bound to be bad investments that become non-performing loans and those in turn will result in bank failures.  All of this was in place before the virus hit, and it put China in a weak position to respond to the crisis with a fiscal and monetary stimulus. The IMF estimates that the U.S. fiscal stimulus this year will be more than 10 percent of GDP, whereas China’s response will be about 5 percent. It makes sense for China to be cautious given the level of non-performing loans and the weak state of its financial system. Aside from avoiding a financial crisis, China’s financial system in the future will need to do a better job in allocating capital. Stabilizing leverage means that credit will grow less rapidly than it did in the recent past, and China will need a financial system that allocates credit to uses with the highest returns.  Concretely, what does this mean for policy? Up until recently foreign financial institutions have been constrained from expanding in China and providing competition to the state-owned banks, mostly through a requirement that they operate as minority partners in joint ventures. Now foreign institutions will be able to have 100 percent–owned subsidiaries in China, an important reform on paper. But it remains to be seen how easy it will be for foreign banks to operate in China in practice. Opening space for the domestic private sector is important as well, though in the short run the big international banks are more likely to provide competition for the huge state-owned institutions.  On paper, China has had flexible interest rates for some time. But there is not much flexibility in practice, either through changes over time in response to market conditions or through differentiation in interest rates for different customers based on risk. This lack of flexibility probably reflects central bank guidance plus the oligopolized nature of financial services, so introducing new private banks should help. Another way to introduce more flexibility and competition into the system is to reform capital markets. Going to the stock or bond markets for financing is a bureaucratic process in China for firms, subject to administrative approvals. If, alternatively, firms that meet standards could make their own decisions about stock and bond issuances, then many large, successful firms would turn to capital markets for lower cost financing. This would leave the commercial banks to focus on smaller, riskier firms, plus households, and the end result would be a more differentiated set of interest rates.  All of these reforms are needed before China can open its capital account and become integrated into the global financial system. There are two basic ingredients to a financial crisis: bad investments that lead to non-performing loans, and withdrawal of the banks’ funding sources. China has the first but not the second. China’s banks are financed by domestic household deposits—China’s famous high savings—and are held within China by fairly effective capital controls. If these were to be lifted immediately, there would probably be a large net outflow­— because everyone is aware of the risks in the financial system—and then the second condition for a crisis would be fulfilled. But if over time China opens up financial services (different from opening the capital account), generates more competition and risk-based pricing, and reforms its capital markets, the prevalence of bad investments and non-performing loans should diminish. Opening the capital account is then the last stage of reform, one that allows investment to flow in both directions as households worldwide benefit from diversification.  The basic point here is that going forward the corona-virus raises the risk of a financial crisis and probably also lowers China’s potential growth rate; this makes financial sector reform more important than ever.  COVID-19 Exposes Weaknesses in the Social Safety Net  ​  The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed weaknesses in China’s social safety net, the most important of which involves migrant workers. There are both social and economic reasons to address these weaknesses now. On the social side, migrants will be most vulnerable if there is a resurgence of the virus or the emergence of any similar virus. In this crisis, China used ad hoc measures, for example, by providing care to all infected people in Wuhan. But it would be better to have in place high-quality healthcare for everyone before the next health crisis occurs. On the economic side, there is likely to be reduced demand for exports and investment, as enumerated above. Also, although uncertain at this point, probably some consumer habits will change permanently, and there is likely to be less private consumption of certain services going forward. An obvious substitute for lost private demand would be more government provision of social services, such as healthcare, education, unemployment compensation, and pensions. To provide more public services sustainably, China will need new sources of government revenue, notably a property tax at the local level. Since any such tax will fall disproportionately on the rich, while expanded social services will, ideally, benefit the entire population, this policy will also help reduce inequality in China.  The current problem with China’s safety net primarily concerns the coverage of migrants. At the end of 2019 official statistics showed 290 million migrants,[15] that is, people with rural hukous working in urban areas. That is nearly one-half of the urban labor force. Many of these migrants have been in the same city for long periods. We may have a false image of migrants as young workers who leave the farm for better opportunities, but the average age of migrants has been rising steadily, from 34 years old in 2008 to 41 years old in 2019. One-quarter of the migrant workforce is now over the age of 50.[16] Registered urban workers have fairly good social services, though the quality varies from city to city. Migrants can participate in the urban social programs provided they have a formal employment contract. But only about one-third of migrants have formal contracts, and this figure has been going down; in 2009 43 percent of migrants had formal contracts.[17] This means that today about 200 million migrant workers are not benefiting from public services, even though they contribute to local GDP and the tax base. This is a nice system for registered urban workers and the minority of migrants with employment contracts, but it leaves a large pool of migrants to fend for themselves in terms of healthcare, unemployment insurance, and pensions.  Aside from covering migrants, there is also the question of the portability of benefits, an issue that becomes more important as China ages. The population over the age of 65 will increase from about 200 million today to 400 million by 2049, while the overall population will decline slightly. Within this group, the most rapid rise will be the population that is 85 years old and older—from fewer than 50 million today to more than 150 million in 2049.[18] Taking care of the elderly would be a challenge under any situation, but the challenge will be compounded by the rural-urban divide discussed above. Most of the elderly live in the countryside, though their working-aged children have often moved to the cities as migrant workers (frequently leaving behind school-aged children). Rural health systems are weak compared to urban systems, so taking care of the elderly will require a combination of more permanent migration to the cities (with access to benefits) plus strengthened delivery of rural services. It is time for China to completely scrap the hukou registration system that limits permanent migration and to unify rural and urban pensions, health insurance, and educational systems.  Dealing well with aging is first and foremost a social issue. But it also has economic implications. As China’s workforce shrinks, the 55–64-year-old cohort will increase dramatically. Keeping this group and the “young-olds” (65–85 years old) healthy and active is China’s best hope for staving off a dramatic decline in the labor force. Improving rural education is also critical because about one-half of the workers of the future will be going to school in the countryside, and deficiencies in their education will affect China’s growth for years to come.  What is the relation of this to the COVID-19 pandemic? There is a lot of uncertainty right now, but probably even under the best scenario people, fearful of travel and large crowds, will be slow to return to their former consumption habits. There will be some return to normalcy, but there likely will still be a big shortfall in private consumption. This is the perfect time to dramatically expand public resources to address weaknesses in the safety net. Among other things, it will provide insurance against future pandemics.  Conclusion  ​  China is leading the major economies in recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and recession. But for a variety of reasons there is unlikely to be a quick “V-shaped” recovery to the old growth path. Prolonged global weakness plus the U.S.-China trade war mean that exports will not play the same role as they did in the past. In addition, the buildup of debt to risky levels means that investment cannot play as strong a role as it did in the past. And while uncertain at this moment, there is a good chance that people will be more cautious about many activities even after a vaccine is developed, so private consumption will be lower and household savings will be higher than they were when China was on its previous growth path.  China can turn all of these factors to its advantage, but it will take an acceleration of reform to do so. New trade agreements could deepen China’s integration into the world economy, even as it turns away from the U.S. Following through on the RCEP will be a start. Joining the CPTPP would be a smart next move as it would require serious structural reforms and would cement China’s position at the heart of Asia-Pacific supply chains. To manage the growing risks in the financial system, credit will have to grow less rapidly than it did in the past, meaning that the Chinese economy should be less dependent on the quantity of investment. Hence the quality of investment will become more important, and more openness and competition in financial services will make the allocation of capital more efficient. Finally, the drop in private consumption may provide an opportunity to expand social services. To do this sustainably will require new revenue sources, especially for local governments. Chinese people are likely to welcome a shift in the growth model so that there is less private consumption than there would have been otherwise but there are more and better public services. Each of the reforms enumerated, however, will face opposition from special interests that benefit from the current system, and it remains to be seen if the leadership will be willing and able to take on these interests in order to put China on a new and sustainable growth path.  ​  ​  About the Contributor  ​  David Dollar is a senior fellow in the John L.

However, some are concerned about the quality of the vaccines and that they are being used to gain political leverage. Beijing is so confident of its inoculations that authorities have been administering vaccines for more than a month before clinical studies conclude, authorities revealed last week.  People deemed at higher risk of infection, such as border officials and state-owned enterprise employees working overseas, have received jabs, after the government approved them for emergency use, according to state media. Soon, transport and service workers are expected to be vaccinated.  Read More  ""Giving untested vaccines means that there is no guarantee that they are going to work, so people could wrongly assume that they are inoculated when they are not,"" said Nicholas Thomas, a health security expert and professor at the City University of Hong Kong. ""In doing so, they could engage in behaviour that has a higher risk...[and] unwittingly put other people at risk.  ""The reason why vaccines go through phase 3 trials is to reduce the short and long-term risk to the individual. Giving vaccine shots without this knowledge places individuals at significant risk.""  The Chinese government has provided sparse details on which vaccines are being given to people, and how many have been vaccinated, leading to concerns participation may be forced and not voluntary.  Last week, Papua New Guinea cancelled a flight from China filled with arriving passengers believed to have received a coronavirus vaccine over worries of the unknown health impact to the local population.  In general, ""it's better for a community if there's more people vaccinated, so there's less risk of an outbreak of Covid"", said Ben Cowling, division head of epidemiology and biostatistics at Hong Kong University's School of Public Health. ""At the same time, just having some vaccinated people wouldn't be enough to mean that social distancing could be relaxed.""  Governments are under increasing pressure to find a lasting solution for the pandemic that has killed more than 840,000 people.  Winning the vaccine race would give China a new tool for diplomacy and potentially bring more allies into the fold.  Beijing has already vowed ""to give priority"" to a number of south-east Asian nations - the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam - if it develops a vaccine.  Whether the world will trust a Chinese vaccine remains to be seen.  It comes as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases globally has topped 25 million, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.  The US leads the count with 5.9 million cases, followed by Brazil with 3.8 million and India with 3.5 million.  The real number of people infected by the virus around the world is believed to be much higher - perhaps 10 times higher in the US, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention - given testing limitations and the many mild cases that have gone unreported or unrecognised. The US has recorded the most deaths at 182,779, followed by Brazil with 120,262 and Mexico with 63,819.  The figures come as India registered a record 78,761 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the worst single-day spike in the world.  Meanwhile, the education minister in France has said not all classrooms in the country can safely reopen tomorrow, amid a persistent rise in infections.

On Friday, after multiple requests for answers, the Florida Department of Health said the information about the number of COVID-19 cases in schools was ‘confidential.’ …. Healthcare law experts who spoke to News4Jax have denied that the statute cited by Florida health officials applies to school systems. The Florida Department of Health did not respond to questions asking if or when it will give school districts approval to publish the data. The health officials also didn’t give a specific date for when they plan to release the updated copy of the data themselves.”  FL: “COVID-19 turned their Miami Springs nursing home into a death trap. The virus killed 52” [Miami Herald]. “Early in the pandemic, Florida was determined to keep a lid of secrecy on the spread of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities. The state refused to identify homes where positive tests had occurred until the Miami Herald and other news organizations banded together and filed a public records lawsuit. As for Fair Havens specifically, multiple workers said they weren’t initially told which residents had COVID-19, or given the proper PPE (a claim Fair Havens disputes). There also wasn’t adequate training, inspection reports confirm. ‘They didn’t want to say anything to the personnel working there,’ [nursing assistant Niurka Solano] said, a sentiment shared by others who worked there. As of the beginning of May, the facility’s infection control nurse did not keep a surveillance map of infections within the facility, according to an inspection report.” • “Fair Havens.” “Never eat at a place called ‘Mom’s’.”  IA: “Ames, Iowa City COVID Outbreaks Are Worst In The World” [Iowa Starting Line]. “Iowa’s exploding COVID-19 outbreaks at state universities in Ames and Iowa City are now disasters that can only be fully measured on a global scale. Ames holds the distinction this morning as the worst coronavirus outbreak in the entire United States, while Iowa City is at third on the list [Update: on Monday, Iowa City climbed to the number two spot in the list, while Ames remained at the top]. The per capita rates are worse than any individual country in the world, and appear to surpass any state in some of the other currently hardest-hit countries.”  IL: “COVID-19’s true toll in Illinois is likely higher than reported. A closer look at ‘excess deaths’ in 2020.” [Chicago Tribune]. “The official COVID-19 death toll in Illinois may not account for at least 1,000 fatalities — and potentially far more — that could be attributable to the pandemic, according to a Tribune analysis of federal data. Through July 25, Illinois had officially recorded 7,397 COVID-19 deaths. But public health experts say that for a fuller picture of the pandemic’s toll, it’s important to look at so-called excess deaths — or deaths beyond the number that would typically occur during a given time period. Examining excess deaths can help capture both COVID-19 cases that went uncounted and the greater numbers of deaths from conditions exacerbated by the pandemic, such as untreated heart attacks or fatal drug overdoses. ‘There is an excess mortality, even though we’re doing our best to capture all these COVID-19 deaths,” said Dr. Ponni Arunkumar, Cook County’s chief medical examiner. ‘Just looking at the excess mortality after this pandemic ends is the only way we can get a true sense of the numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 .'” • Yep.  NY: “Here’s the check: Restaurants serve NY $2B lawsuit” [The Real Deal]. “More than 300 restaurants are seeking class-action status for a lawsuit against the city and state, demanding they fork over $2 billion for banning indoor dining, Crain’s reported…. The lead plaintiff in the suit is the Queens restaurant Il Bacco, which sits just 500 feet from the Nassau County border, where indoor dining is allowed at 50 percent capacity. ‘According to Gov. Cuomo, it is dangerous to eat at [Il Bacco] in Little Neck, Queens, but it is safe to dine indoors a few hundred feet east,’ says the suit. New York City is the only area of the state where indoor dining is not allowed. The lawsuit — filed the same day that New Jersey announced indoor dining will resume at 25 percent capacity — argues that there is no scientific evidence for the restriction.”  OH: “Ohio’s coronavirus cases drop after statewide mask order, dramatically so in some counties” [Cleveland.com]. • Handy chart:  Ohio’s coronavirus cases drop after statewide mask order, dramatically so in some counties – trust science https://t.co/ZNohIJtVOt — joecimperman (@joecimperman) August 28, 2020  The unbiquitous “trust science”… That thinking is so sloppy and bad.  Politics  “But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?” –James Madison, Federalist 51  “They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.” –Frank Herbert, Dune  “They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.” –Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord  The electoral map. July 17: Georgia, Ohio, ME-2 move from Leans Republican to Toss-up. Continued yikes. On July 7, the tossup were 86. Only July 17, they were 56. Now they are 91. This puts Biden at 278, i.e. over 270. August 18: Still no changes. August 31: Indiana moves from Likely to Safe Republican. Despite the sturm and drang, and the polls, the consensus on the electoral college remains the same: Biden ahead, Trump within striking distance.    Click the map to create your own at 270toWin.com  So, taking the consensus as a given, 270 (total) – 204 (Trump’s) = 66. Trump must win 66 from the states in play: AZ (11), FL (29), MI (16), NC (15), PA (20), and WI (10) plus 1 to win not tie = 102. 102 – 66 = 36. So if Trump wins FL, MI, NC, and PA (29 + 16 + 15 + 20 = 80), he wins. That’s a heavy lift. I think I’ve got the math right this time!  Time to restore the election countdown:  2020  Biden (D)(1): “The Left Case Against Supporting Joe Biden in the General Election:” [Benjamin Studebaker (Deschain)]. “Joe Biden loves to tell us that “nothing will fundamentally change”. If nothing changes, another Democrat will normalise what Trump has done and frustrate the American people into voting for someone even more right-wing. Look at what’s happened with Bush. He’s more popular than ever before. In the 00s, we recognised that Bush was nuts…. The Democrats are a big part of how we got to where we are. And if we think that the Republicans are authoritarian nationalists, it is the Democrats who have encouraged them to become that way. The ordinary American cannot look to the Democrats to resist the ravenous elite. They look to the nationalist firebrands of the right because there is nothing else on the menu….We [the left] can oppose the Trump administration in its second term. But if it’s Biden, we’ll be stuck defending him as he slugs the ordinary American in the face. The American people won’t forget the black eye we’ve given them, and they’ll vote for the leaders who will be the death of us.” Biden (D)(2): “Voting in a De-Facto Military State” [Patrick Lawrence, Consortium News (pjay)]. On foreign policy: Biden promises a straight-ahead return to the policies that prevailed under Obama and Obama’s predecessors: a reclamation of “global leadership,” a renewed emphasis on interventions we justify, per usual, by casting ourselves as humanity’s archangels…. Team Biden’s foreign policy advisers are vast in number. Foreign Policy counts more than 2,000 of them, organized into 20 working groups covering specific issues — arms control, defense, intelligence, humanitarian missions, and so on —and geographies: Europe, the Middle East, East Asia. These people come from consultancies, think tanks, the State Department, academia. There is a heavy layer of Obama administration holdovers and, of course, Pentagon bureaucrats, some quite senior. UPDATE Biden (D)(3): “Biden is on track to lose the Electoral College” [Boston Globe]. “A month or so ago, the notion that President Trump would win reelection was dismissed as delusional…. His reelection campaign hasn’t just given up on trying to win the popular vote; they never thought it was possible in the first place. Former vice president Joe Biden, however, is fully capable of losing enough states to lose the election in the Electoral College. If the last three weeks are any indication, he’s well on his way to doing just that…. A Change Research poll was posted at CNBC.com. The top-line national number had Biden comfortably ahead. But in the six ‘battleground states,’ Biden’s lead, statistically speaking, had evaporated. What all the pros know is that the president ‘under-polls.’ Trump is usually 2 percent stronger than he ‘performs’ in any given published poll. “People don’t want to admit they’re voting for Trump,” said one pollster. Bloomberg News recently ran a story saying the same thing. If Trump under-polling is a matter of fact, then the races in the six battleground states, the ones that will decide the outcome in November, are dead heats.” • Ulp. More: “The Biden campaign’s theory is that the election is a referendum on Trump — nothing more, nothing less…. For many weeks, this was the rationale behind Biden’s confinement to his basement in his home in Delaware. The idea being that you stand aside when your opponent is busy self-destructing…. One of the central tenets of politics was captured years ago by Osama bin Laden. He said: ‘When people see a strong horse and a weak horse, they will naturally want to side with the strong horse.’ Biden, throughout this phase of the general election campaign, has been the weak horse. Whatever else it did, the Republican National Convention projected Trump as the strong horse. And nowhere is it written that voters have to like Trump to vote for him.” • A fire bell in the night…. UPDATE Biden (D)(4): “Can Biden’s Center Hold?” [The New Yorker]. Betteridge’s Law, binch, plus the Yeats reference agrees (“mere anarchy is loosed up the world”). “Biden entered the Democratic primaries with a narrow goal: to end the Trump Presidency. Most Americans, he argued, did not want a revolution. At an early fund-raiser in New York, he promised not to “demonize” the rich and said that ‘nothing would fundamentally change.’…. But, by the time Biden effectively clinched the nomination, in March, he had begun to describe his candidacy as a bid for systemic change on the scale of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal.” • The seeming paradox disappears when you realize that in the first quote, Biden was talking to his donors. The New Yorker’s tweet is wrong: Almost precisely a year after assuring skittish voters that “nothing would fundamentally change” if he was elected, Joe Biden said that America was due for “some revolutionary institutional changes.” Read @eosnos‘s Profile of the Presidential hopeful.https://t.co/nnW59wjaO0 — The New Yorker (@NewYorker) September 1, 2020 Not “skittish voters.” Donors. Big donors. I’m so old I remember when The New Yorker was famous for fact-checking…. Another snippet: “When I asked Obama about the tensions in the Party, he cast them as features of ‘the traditional Democratic idea.” He said, ‘You have a big-tent party. And that means that you tolerate, listen to, and embrace folks who are different than you, and try to get them in the fold.'” • Like, the Bush administration and Sanders at the same time. Tents, no matter how big, don’t tend to cover this county and the next one, too. Anyhow, worth reading to get a sense of where the liberals’ liberals at The New Yorker are. UPDATE Biden (D)(5): “Biden condemns violence and asks if Americans ‘really feel safe under Donald Trump'” [CNN]. Biden: “I want to be very clear about all of this: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It’s lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted. Violence will not bring change, it will only bring destruction. It’s wrong in every way.” • Idea: Another Crime Bill! Trump (R)(1): “Why Trump Commands So Much Loyalty From His Base” [Counterpunch]. “Willing to overlook his lies, improprieties, and corruption, Trump’s voters have a transactional relationship with the president that is practical, powerful, and surprisingly instructional to the rest of us…. Trump’s presidency has meant very clear-cut things to specific (but overlapping) communities, movements, and demographics. He offers his anti-abortion supporters a radical transformation of the judiciary from lifetime federal judgeships to Supreme Court seats. To his anti-immigrant base, he has shown he is willing to go to any lengths to keep out migrants and refugees, going as far as separating children from parents and even deporting them into the hands of their abusers. To racist suburban white people, he is making good on a promise to keep Black and Brown people out of their neighborhoods. To law enforcement, their families, and supporters, he has promised to uphold police autonomy and immunity from prosecution. And on and on. Examined through the lens of such far-reaching promises that Trump has either kept his word on or aggressively pursued, it is no wonder that enough Americans are supporting him so as to make the election competitive. Trump has shown his base that he is willing to go as far as it takes to please them, including violating norms, pushing the boundaries of laws, and even breaking them. Such fealty is rare in a politician, let alone in a president. Trump offers his base clear-cut policies while his campaign hopes that voters look past his character flaws… In contrast, the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden offers his voters few specific policies or sweeping changes, and his campaign hopes the Democratic Party base focuses mostly on his character, personality, and words and connects with him on a personal level.” • If I could get #MedicareForAll out of Biden, I’d be as transactional as all get out, and I’d overlook Biden’s massive and obvious character flaws, as well as his horrid record. UPDATE Trump (R)(2): “An unlikely state tightens up” [Politico]. “Minnesota, which once looked like a vanity project for Donald Trump, is suddenly emerging as a critical test of his effort to turn his campaign around. Interviews with more than a dozen officials and strategists from both parties in recent days depict a state in which Joe Biden is leading, but where the president is making inroads in rural Minnesota. … In the run-up to the 2016 election, Minnesota seemed like a stretch for Trump. No Republican had carried the state since Richard Nixon in 1972, and Trump made minimal effort there. Even so, Trump came close to victory, carrying 78 of Minnesota’s 87 counties and losing the state by fewer than 45,000 votes. Following the election, Trump said he regretted not doing more. The state’s 10 electoral votes — the same number as neighboring Wisconsin — became an enduring source of infatuation for him. He’s still preoccupied with his near-miss four years later. ‘One more speech, I would have won,’ Trump told a crowd recently in Mankato, a small college town in southern Minnesota. ‘It was so close.'” • A Trump crowd in a college town? Can any Minnesotans comment on this? UPDATE Trump (R)(3): “Six Democrat mayors in Minnesota endorse Trump over Biden” [WFLA]. “Six Democrat mayors in Minnesota announced they’ve endorsed President Donald Trump over Joe Biden saying the Democratic candidate hasn’t done enough to help the working class. In the letter dated Friday and viewed by the Duluth News Tribune, the mayors argued, “by putting tariffs on our products and supporting bad trade deals, politicians like Joe Biden did nothing to help the working class.” The mayors claimed their region dubbed Iron Range had lost ‘thousands of jobs.’ That portion of Minnesota they represent is named for its iron ore mining districts.” • I don’t know why Trump isn’t hammering the fact that he shit-canned TPP. UPDATE Trump (R)(4): “Iron Range mayors pitch Trump with Pence” [Duluth News-Tribune]. “Kevin Arenz, 58, and Chris Klein, 37, rode motorcycles to the event from the Twin Cities, riding for the Boots on the Ground Bikers for Trump. ‘I don’t consider him a politician,’ Arenz, of Savage, Minnesota, said of Trump. ‘He’s the president of the United States and the president of the world. What he’s doing by stopping endless wars wouldn’t have happened without him.’ ‘I don’t care what comes out of his mouth,’ Klein, of Richfield, Minnesota, said of Trump. ‘I care that he has balls.'” * * * “DNC Pours All Campaign Funding Into New York, California To Win Popular Vote By Even Greater Margin Than 2016” [The Onion]. • Actually, they’re not doing this.

If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.  Manufacturing: “August 2020 ISM and Markit Manufacturing Surveys Continue To Improve” [Econintersect]. “The ISM Manufacturing survey improved and remains in expansion. The Markit PMI manufacturing index also improved and remains in expansion…. Based on these surveys and the district Federal Reserve Surveys, one would expect the Fed’s Industrial Production index growth rate to be slightly better than last month. Overall, surveys do not have a high correlation to the movement of industrial production (manufacturing) since the Great Recession. No question these surveys suggest the economy is no longer in recession.” • “The economy” is doing a lot more work there than it normally does, considering the massive restructuring in favor of monopolies that’s underway.  Leading Indicators: “22 August 2020 New York Fed Weekly Economic Index (WEI): Index Declined But Remains On A Recovery Trend” [Econintersect]. “The New York Fed’s Weekly Leading Index (WLI) continues to show an economy that is marginally worse than seen during the Great Recession. However, this index remains on a recovery trend…. This data set should be considered a high-frequency coincident indicator on a par with the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Business Conditions Index produced by the Philly Fed – and both show conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic are already worse than the Great Recession. However, the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Business Conditions Index is improving whilst the WLI is still declining. Logic would say with the partial reopening of the economy – the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Business Conditions Index seems to be correct.” • 63 days…  * * *  Debt: “Credit Card Firms Split on Fate of Consumers While U.S. Cuts Aid” [Bloomberg]. “A fissure is forming in the U.S. credit card industry: Are consumers about to go bankrupt or bounce back? On one side, risk-management pioneer Capital One Financial Corp. is reining in credit lines to reduce its exposure. On the other, the nation’s largest card issuer, JPMorgan Chase & Co., is rolling out a new card designed for travelers and diners — the ultimate countercyclical bet. Those moves are just the tip of a debate unfolding inside the industry as Congress deadlocks over extending $600 weekly checks to millions of unemployed Americans. In some corners, worries are mounting that households will struggle to make ends meet, max out their credit and default. But some banks see an opportunity to attract people who are still doing fine.  Retail: “AirAsia to Charge Passengers Who Check In at Airport Counters” [Bloomberg]. “AirAsia’s Chief Operations Officer Javed Malik said the move is aimed at encouraging customers to use the other check-in means and minimize physical contact between guests and staff during the coronavirus pandemic. Fees will be waived for passengers with reduced mobility and premium travelers, as well as those affected by flight disruptions or airport kiosk outages, AirAsia said. The charges apply to airport counters in Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, as well as Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan and Hawaii’s capital Honolulu.” • Go long social distancing (and, I suppose, kiosk manufacturing. Though I’d like to know how the fomites on those touch screens are cleaned. How do we know this isn’t a whole new vector of transmission?).  Manufacturing: “Boeing seeks to cut production costs of 787-8 to boost sales” [Leeham News and Analysis]. “The 787-9 and 787-10 are high margin aircraft Boeing counted on to reduce the billions of dollars in deferred production and tooling costs. At one time, this exceeded $32bn. The early program difficulties resulted in the production and parts of the -8 to be substantially different than the -9/10, which have 95% commonality. The -8 was only 30% common. In 2018, Boeing changed the -8’s tail to be virtually identical to the -9/10. The change boosted commonality to about 40%, LNA was told at the time. The key is to get as many parts of the 787-8 to be common with the 787-9 and -10 as possible. During 2019 only six 787-8s were built against 122 787-9/-10. The economics of building six parts per year versus 122 makes the 787-8 a low margin product… Why hasn’t this been done already? With a production of a 787-8 every two months, the investment of revising the thousands of documents and procedures to bring the 787-8 up to the -9/-10 build standard wasn’t a wise investment. The post-COVID market changes this.” • Boeing paid for the 787’s “early program difficulties” with the 737-MAX. Now it’s still paying.  * * *  Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 75 Extreme Greed (previous close: 75 Greed) [CNN]. One week ago: 73 (Greed). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed).

The Biosphere  “How SUVs conquered the world – at the expense of its climate” [Guardian]. “The rise of the SUV as the world’s pre-eminent car has been so rapid that the consequences of this new status – the altered patterns of urban life, air quality, pedestrian safety, where to park the things – are still coming into focus. But it’s increasingly clear that SUVs’ most profound impact is playing out within the climate crisis, where their surging popularity is producing a vast new source of planet-cooking emissions. Last year, the International Energy Agency made a finding that stunned even its own researchers. SUVs were the second largest cause of the global rise in carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade, eclipsing all shipping, aviation, heavy industry and even trucks, usually the only vehicles to loom larger than them on the road.” • They’re obese and vicious-looking. Good job, America, or rather, “Good job, American automobile executives, who should rot in hell next to the cigarette executives.” I hate those things.  “A burning chemical plant may be just the tip of Hurricane Laura’s damage in this area of oil fields and industry” [Phys.org]. “Hurricane Laura’s damage will reveal itself over the coming days. The storm passed directly over the large Hackberry oil field, located in a sensitive marsh environment south of Lake Charles. The area includes thousands of active and abandoned wells and associated infrastructure, such as storage tanks and pipelines…. Chemical plants often operate under emergency rules that relax regulations during and immediately after severe storms…. The failure of storage systems designed to keep the chemicals from reacting with air or water often produces the most dramatic releases. The Arkema chemical fire during Hurricane Harvey and this chlorine gas release are examples of these high-visibility failures. People living near the Arkema plant sued, saying the chemicals caused respiratory problems and contaminated their water. The absence of plant workers during the storm can exacerbate these issues, and small problems can become large ones in the absence of any intervention.”  “DIY Firefighting In California” [NPR]. “While multiple historic fires blazed, it became clear that there’s a shortage of firefighters, airplanes and firetrucks to combat them. The state is doing what it can, but many calls for help have gone unanswered. It’s been a similar story over the past few years. It’s why Californians are increasingly taking matters into their own hands — creating a growing market for DIY firefighting. As California entered this fire season, people began trying to sell used firetrucks on the Bay Area’s Craigslist. One Craiglister posted a 1975 GMC firetruck for $7,000 or best offer. ‘Save yourself from a disaster,’ they wrote. A man named Paul posted a 1982 Ford firetruck for $15,000. He assures it’s ‘in good working order.’ But there’s a catch: ‘for pick up in North Dakota.’ That’s a 30-hour drive away. A company called Vans From Japan has gotten into a business you might call firetruck arbitrage. You know, buying firetrucks in one place and making a profit by selling them in another place where they’re more valuable. The Sacramento-based company has a whole fleet of tiny firetrucks imported from Japan that it’s trying to sell on Craigslist.” • Maybe I should file this under Failed State instead…  “He turned his concrete patio in East L.A. into an edible garden with fruit trees” [Los Angeles Times]. “Ken Sparks is a sentimental gardener. The Ohio native’s East L.A. garden is filled with more than 50 types of fruit trees and plants, some of which pay homage to his family and reflect the diversity of his hometown of Twinsburg. ‘I have little pieces of home in my garden,’ said Sparks, 37, as he identified water lilies and an heirloom beefsteak begonia from his grandmother’s garden. ‘One of the things that keep me grounded is my garden. It reminds me of my family, and of Ohio.’ His terraced backyard is primarily concrete, but he has managed to transform the hardscape into something alive and soft with chickens, a butterfly garden and a surplus of organic vegetables that he has planted in raised beds installed on top of concrete.” • This sounds lovely. (Let us also remember that those who don’t own property may find gardening harder than those who do. I was lucky!)  “Flat-Earthers Have a Wild New Theory About Forests” [The Atlantic]. “A bizarre new theory has turned the flat earth upside down. The flat earth is still flat, but now it’s dotted with tiny imitations of the truly enormous trees that once covered the continents, and which in our deforested age we can hardly even remember….. ‘They make us think that this is a forest,’ he tells us, ‘when you are actually looking at thirty-meter bushes. After watching this video, you will reverse your concept of forests by 360 degrees.’ This isn’t a forest at all: only a diminished imitation. Thousands of years ago, a cataclysmic event destroyed 99% of the Earth’s biosphere, and when it happened, it took away the real forests. Real trees are nothing like their stunted cousins, the miserable perishing scraps of wood that we see today; they were truly vast, hundreds of kilometers tall, magical organisms that sustained a total living ecology of the flat earth. These things were the anchor of a beautiful world that has now vanished forever. And how does he know? Because everywhere around us, we can see their stumps.”  “An Open Letter to Parents For Future” [Ecological Survival]. “Our efforts as concerned parents are crucial because we are in a unique position to help. We share our children’s fear and anger about the crisis, and therefore understand the urgent need for a rational response. But, unlike them, we have had sufficient time to gain the knowledge and experience required to determine what this response should be. Thus, although the young must organizationally lead the drive to sustainability, we must be its primary strategists.” • Hmm. I wonder what your children think about that.  Health Care  “The Most American COVID-19 Failure Yet” [The Atlantic]. “Contact tracing, the last two-thirds of health wonks’ “test-trace-isolate” mantra, was supposed to get us out of the pandemic…. In the United States, this whole process is failing, allowing Aunt Sally to continue roaming about town, infecting others and spreading COVID-19. There is no national contact-tracing program in the U.S., and contact tracers who work for the 40 local health departments in areas with the most coronavirus cases have reached just a fraction of the patients who have tested positive, a Reuters investigation found earlier this month. In Maryland, 25 percent of those called by contact tracers don’t pick up. At one point in Miami, contact tracers were able to reach only 17 percent of the infected. In Houston, New Jersey, and California’s Inland Empire, half of the people reached by contact tracers won’t cooperate. In Philadelphia, a third of COVID-19 patients claimed they had no contacts. Philadelphia is one of the country’s most densely populated cities; it’s hard to believe that a third of the people who got sick there had no contact with their fellow Philadelphians.” • Well worth a read. I’ll comment only that any program designer who thought people would pick up a phone call from an unknown number didn’t understand the country. Who would be demented enough to do that?

The ministry had discussed the plan with counterparts from neighbouring countries, especially Cambodia, prior to the Covid-19 crisis. The discussions will resume as soon as the outbreak subsides and borders reopen, he said.  Mr Varawut announced the plan at Phukiew Wildlife Sanctuary in Chaiyaphum, where he supervised the release of deer born at the ministry's breeding centre in Chon Buri.  There are only about 100 Eld's deer left in Thailand, half of which were bred and raised at the Chon Buri breeding centre. The critically endangered species has been on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List since 2008.  Despite the success of the state's breeding programme -- which culminated in the release of seven deer at Phanom Dong Rak Wildlife Sanctuary in Si Sa Ket last year and this year at Chaiyaphum -- the lack of breeding pairs has raised concerns about inbreeding.  The centre only has 10 breeding pairs, which it received over a decade ago, said the chief of the ministry's breeding centre, Sompong Boonsanong.  Chatchawan Intumarn, head of Phu Khiew Wildlife Sanctuary said that the ministry is planning to make the Phu Khiew Forest Complex a model site for releasing endangered species bred in captivity back to nature.  The sanctuary -- along with Khao Yai National Park -- have been chosen by the ministry as the site to release tigers into nature.  ""If they produce offspring, it proves the area's suitability for such purpose,"" he said."

Advertisement  In January 2017, three days after the inauguration of President Donald Trump in the United States, the Indian writer Brahma Chellaney published an article describing China’s gargantuan Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a form of “debt-trap diplomacy.” The aim of the multibillion-dollar infrastructure initiative, Chellaney argued, was to saddle small nations with debt that could not hope to repay, “leaving them even more firmly under China’s thumb.”  The “debt-trap” label quickly stuck, and has morphed since into something approaching conventional wisdom, especially in Washington. Then-U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would later that year describe Chinese loans to finance infrastructure projects as a form of “predatory economics.” In late 2018, then-National Security Adviser John Bolton claimed that Beijing’s “predatory actions” were aimed at “advancing Chinese global dominance.”  However, a new report from the London-based think-tank Chatham House offers a robust challenge to the “debt-trap diplomacy” thesis. As noted last week by my colleague Abhijnan Rej, the report’s authors, Lee Jones and Shahar Hameiri, portray a reality that is much more messy and ambiguous. To begin with, they argue that the BRI has been driven less by global strategic considerations than by domestic economic factors — particularly, the need to find overseas outlets for Chinese industrial overcapacity.  They argue that China’s development financing arrangements are too chaotic and poorly coordinated to produce anything approaching a cohesive strategy. Complicating the picture further are the decisions and actions of recipient governments, which have piggy-backed on the BRI in order to advance their own domestic interests. Governance problems at both ends “often result in badly conceived and poorly managed projects with substantial negative economic, political, social, and environmental implications.”  Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter  Jones and Hameiri base their conclusions on detailed case studies of controversial Chinese investments in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. In other parts of the region, however, the BRI picture is if anything even more chaotic. Consider the recent news that the Chinese embassy in Myanmar was forced to issue a press statement officially dissociating itself from a controversial $15 billion border development currently under construction in eastern Kayin state, across the border from Thailand. The statement attempted to make clear that the sprawling Shwe Kokko New City, a 72,843-hectare assemblage of hotels, casinos, luxury villas, and industrial zones, was “a third-country investment and has nothing to do with the Belt and Road Initiative.”  Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.  The Shwe Kokko project, which is being built by a Chinese company called the Yatai International Holding Group in partnership with an armed militia allied with the Myanmar military, broke ground in 2017, with ambitious plans to establish a hub of “science and technology, gambling and entertainment, tourism, culture and agriculture.” These also included an international airport, a “huge Safari World,” and an “international firearms training center.” In practice, much of Yatai’s activities have focused on online gambling, which is banned in China, but flourishes — to the tune of $24 billion per year — in the more relaxed jurisdictions of Southeast Asia.  The Chinese embassy’s denials came after several years in which Yatai and its little-known chairman She Zhijiang have claimed the mantle of Xi Jinping’s grand enterprise. According to Yatai’s promotional materials, Shwe Kokko New City represents “a new chapter for the Belt and Road Initiative,” while a promotional video produced by Yatai is chock full of references to the BRI. Given that the Shwe Kokko project is deeply unpopular in Kayin state, where it has resulted in land confiscations, an inflow of Chinese workers, and the social ills that inevitably accompany gambling operations, Chinese officials are rightly concerned about the project’s potential to tarnish the BRI as a whole.  A similar example can be seen in Cambodia, where the arrival of the BRI has been accompanied by a transformative wave of Chinese private investment, much of it involving gambling. In 2015, the coastal port-city of Sihanoukville was officially designated as a focus for BRI developments; within three years, it had metamorphosed into a miniature Macau on the Gulf of Thailand, drawing in huge numbers of Chinese nationals to work, run, and gamble in the city’s dozens of casinos.  Advertisement  Before long, Sihanoukville’s freewheeling casino economy had swamped “official” BRI projects like the $2 billion expressway connecting Sihanoukville to the capital Phnom Penh, and the Special Economic Zone located next to the city’s port. Following in its wake were reports of violent crime, prostitution, and drug trafficking.  Concerned about rising anti-Chinese sentiment among the Cambodian public, Prime Minister Hun Sen’s government, at the apparent urging of Beijing, announced a ban on online gambling operations, effective January 1 this year. This, along with the effects of COVID-19, has largely brought Sihanoukville’s casino boom to an end. But the Cambodian and Chinese governments continue to clean up the mess that has sprung up around the BRI, with every week bringing fresh reports of the arrests of Chinese nationals on charges running from kidnapping to drug trafficking. As in Myanmar, the association of the BRI with unsavory private interests has threatened to tarnish an important bilateral relationship.  Private Chinese companies have a number of reasons why they might want to associate themselves with the BRI. One is to foster the impression that they enjoy the backing of the Chinese state, thus smoothing their access to elite circles in foreign countries. Another is to curry political favor at home, where private businesses have been encouraged to participate in the BRI, and offer declarations of support for the BRI and official shibboleths like “Xi Jinping Thought.”  One problem of the BRI is that it has always been difficult to define precisely. It has never been clear which projects are “officially” part of the scheme, nor what its outer limits are. In this sense, the BRI scheme is consistent with the Chinese government’s tendency to launch projects with great fanfare, and only later to fill them with content.  As it stands, Beijing is struggling to safeguard the BRI’s reputation from the interests of recipient governments and private firms, whose activities often run counter to the objectives of the BRI — even as they parrot its rhetoric."

SYDNEY: Say it quietly, lest the wrath of the pandemic gods be triggered. But the wheels of in-person diplomacy are starting to turn again across Asia.  The smiling handshakes are gone, replaced by awkward elbow bumps and socially distanced photo opportunities. The negotiating tables have been moved further apart. And there are face masks and hand sanitiser all round.  Advertisement  Advertisement  While some countries have their first pandemic waves under control others are still struggling to control COVID-19.  Yet, from Japan and China to Indonesia and Singapore, Asia’s leading diplomats have re-commenced regular manoeuvres in the last few weeks. It is a sign that when it comes to high-level foreign policy, Zoom just does not cut it.  After receiving his counterparts from Indonesia, Pakistan and Hungary last week, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi headed off on a grand tour of Europe, taking in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway.  Meanwhile, Yang Jiechi, the head of foreign affairs for China’s Communist Party and a Politburo member, has been in Singapore and South Korea.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Not wanting to be outdone, Japan sent its foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, to Papua New Guinea, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar – all developing nations where China has been exerting increasing influence – as well as the UK.  Meanwhile, Indonesian foreign minister Retno Marsudi travelled to Singapore to tee up the annual retreat meeting between President Joko Widodo and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. And Indonesian defence minister Prabowo Subianto has been in Russia and India scouting for new weapons deals.  Advertisement  NOT THE USUAL DIPLOMATIC JAUNTS  Given the health dangers, the hassles and the potential for domestic political blowback, these are not the usual diplomatic jaunts.  Some ministers are germophobes who would rather keep their counterparts on the other end of an Internet connection. Others are suffering diplomatic deficit disorder, craving the engagement, respect and veneration that can only come from in-person meetings. Many are probably feeling a bit of both.  Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi touch elbows in greeting at the end of a news conference at the Renaissance Villa Madama meeting venue in Rome, Italy, August 25, 2020, in this still image taken from video. REUTERS via REUTERS TV  But these officials clearly feel the possible rewards are worth it – or that the risks of leaving the field open to their rivals are too high. It is revealing who is seeing who, and who has been left out.  Wang Yi is on a charm offensive in the European Union, which last year called Beijing a “systemic rival” but is still wary of Washington’s unabashed China-bashing. Pakistan is being shown some love at a time when Beijing’s relations with India are at a nadir.  And Yang Jiechi is seeking to shore up ties with Singapore and South Korea, which have their own qualms about the Trump administration’s China policies.  Japan’s Toshimitsu Motegi has been making the rounds in nations that have been moving closer to China but are still playing their own hedging game, seeking to maximise economic benefits from external partners and get trade and tourism flowing again.  And Indonesia’s foreign minister has been focusing on opening “green lanes” with key travel and investment hubs in China and Singapore, as well as ensuring Indonesia gets access to any Chinese vaccine for COVID-19.  AWAY FROM THE ZOOM WAITING ROOM  In theory, all these issues could be discussed on a video conference. There are certainly advantages to the dreaded Zoom call or Teams meeting.  The pandemic-enforced adoption of this long-standing video conferencing technology has enabled foreign ministers to have many more engagements, in a whirlwind of online diplomatic speed-dating.  And officials are under pressure to be better prepared because the scheduling is much tighter than during multi-day visits.  However, there are doubts about the security of these online platforms. There is no personal touch.  The staid nature of video conferencing leaves no room for the sort of impromptu, sideline conversations where much of the real confidence-building and negotiation happens during summits and trips.

Nevertheless, the broader battle for influence in Asia has moved outside the Zoom waiting room to the echoing corridors of the world’s foreign ministries, presidential palaces and prime ministerial suites.

This growth was due to the gradual reopening of the economies, and to continued strength in the average basket size driven by customer trip consolidation as customers relied more on the proximity and ease of shopping in our locations.

Significant Items of the First Quarter of Fiscal 2021  Due to the ongoing restrictive social measures across the various geographies in which we operate, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a meaningful impact on our financial results, mostly driven by declining traffic throughout our network. The impact of lower traffic on the merchandise sales was however more than offset by an increase in the average basket size as consumers consolidated their purchases. From a fuel perspective, volumes generally improved throughout the quarter following the gradual pickup in overall economic activity and fuel margins remained healthy. Lastly, from an operating expense perspective, we have continued to invest in the health and safety of our employees and customers and have successfully gained the trust of our communities which recognize us as a safe shopping destination. These additional costs were fully offset by initiatives implemented across our network to reduce our controllable expenses.      During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we fully repaid the outstanding balance of $1.5 billion borrowed on our operating credit D with available cash. On August 21, 2020, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we fully repaid, at maturity, our CA $300.0 million ($227.1 million) Canadian-dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes issued on August 21, 2013.      On April 28, 2020, we invested an additional amount of CA $2.5 million ($1.8 million) in Fire & Flower Holdings Corp. (""Fire & Flower""), which consisted of secured convertible debentures as well as common share purchase warrants. On July 23, 2020, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, amendments to our investments in Fire & Flower were announced, which mainly aimed at modifying the maturity and expiry dates of the financial instruments, as well as their respective conversion and exercise price to a lower strike price or to a market-based price. A commitment to exercise a portion of the common share purchase warrants, for an amount of CA $19.0 million, no later than December 31, 2020, would take effect on the same date as the amendments become effective. As at September 1, 2020, these amendments are still subject to customary conditions precedent and regulatory approvals.  Changes in our Network  During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we closed the fifth transaction of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CrossAmerica Partners LP (""CAPL""). In this fifth transaction, we transferred 29 Circle K U.S. stores for a total value of approximately $32.0 million. In exchange, CAPL transferred the real estate for 13 properties of an equivalent value. The remaining assets of this agreement are expected to be exchanged in the second half of calendar 2020.      During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired one company-operated store.      During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the construction of 16 stores and the relocation or reconstruction of 8 stores. As of July 19, 2020, another 23 stores were under construction and should open in the upcoming quarters.      On August 24, 2020, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired 10 company-operated stores from Wadsworth Oil Company of Clanton, Inc., all located in Alabama, within the United States. We settled this transaction using our available cash and existing credit facilities.  Summary of changes in our store network during the first quarter of fiscal 2021  The following table presents certain information regarding changes in our store network over the 12-week period ended July 19, 2020:            12-week period ended July 19, 2020 Type of site  Company-  operated  CODO  DODO  Franchised and  other affiliated  Total Number of sites, beginning of period  9,691  453  689  1,291  12,124 Acquisitions  1  —  —  1  2 Openings / constructions / additions  16  —  7  13  36 Closures / disposals / withdrawals  (56)  (30)  (26)  (62)  (174) Store conversion  (5)  12  (8)  1  — Number of sites, end of period  9,647  435  662  1,244  11,988 Circle K branded sites under licensing agreements                  2,335 Total network                  14,323 Number of automated fuel stations included in the period-end                    figures  983  —  10  —  993  Exchange Rate Data  We use the US dollar as our reporting currency, which provides more relevant information given the predominance of our operations in the United States.

We believe this measure is useful to investors and analysts.  Revenues  Our revenues were $9.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, down by $4.5 billion, a decrease of 31.4% compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. This performance is mainly attributable to the negative impact of COVID-19 on fuel demand, to a lower average road transportation fuel selling price and to the disposal of our interests in CAPL which had an impact of approximately $487.0 million, as well as to the net negative impact from the translation of revenues of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, which had an impact of approximately $165.0 million.  Merchandise and service revenues  Total merchandise and service revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $3.9 billion, an increase of $252.0 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, merchandise and service revenues increased by approximately $304.0 million or 8.5%. This increase is primarily attributable to growth in basket size, which more than offset continued softness in traffic. We saw strength across many categories, especially tobacco products, alcohol, packaged beverages and various grocery items. Same-store merchandise revenues increased by 7.7% in the United States, by 3.4% in Europe, and by 19.9% in Canada.  Road transportation fuel revenues  Total road transportation fuel revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $5.8 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of revenues of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, road transportation fuel revenues decreased by approximately $4.0 billion or 40.6%. This decrease is mostly attributable to the decrease on fuel demand in relation with the stay-at-home measures implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to a lower average road transportation fuel selling price which had a negative impact of approximately $1.8 billion. Same-store road transportation fuel volume decreased in the United States by 21.2%, in Europe by 12.4%, and in Canada by 25.6%.  The following table shows the average selling price of road transportation fuel of our company-operated stores in our various markets for the last eight quarters, starting with the second quarter of the fiscal year ended April 28, 2019:  Quarter  2nd 3rd 4th 1st Weighted  average 52-week period ended July 19, 2020              United States (US dollars per gallon) – excluding CAPL  2.55 2.51 2.21 2.04 2.36  Europe (US cents per liter)  70.86 73.92 60.95 56.89 66.83  Canada (CA cents per liter)  105.14 103.47 88.78 86.89 97.79 52-week period ended July 21, 2019              United States (US dollars per gallon) – excluding CAPL  2.72 2.42 2.51 2.66 2.57  Europe (US cents per liter)  80.56 75.28 74.59 77.35 76.86  Canada (CA cents per liter)  115.22 97.59 103.45 111.16 106.23  Other revenues  Total other revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $86.6 million, a decrease of $101.9 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, other revenues decreased by approximately $75.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, mainly driven by lower aviation fuel revenues, which had a minimal impact on gross profit.  Gross profit  Our gross profit was $2.5 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, up by $202.0 million, or 8.7% compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020, mainly attributable to higher road transportation fuel gross margins and organic growth, partly offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on fuel demand, by the disposal of our interests in CAPL, which had an impact of approximately $49.0 million, and by the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, which had an impact of approximately $27.0 million.  Merchandise and service gross profit  In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our merchandise and service gross profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of $93.0 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, merchandise and service gross profit increased by approximately $109.0 million or 8.8%, mainly attributable to strong organic growth, despite lower traffic in our network due to COVID-19. Our gross margin increased by 0.7% in the United States to 34.7%, mainly due to strong service revenues, and to an accelerated recognition of deferred credits. Excluding this accelerated recognition, our gross margin would have been stable compared to the corresponding quarter of last year. In Europe and in Canada, the gross margin decreased by 0.9% to 40.6%, and by 1.2% to 31.7%, respectively, both negatively impacted by a shift in product mix towards lower margin categories.  Road transportation fuel gross profit  In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our road transportation fuel gross profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of $131.4 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, our first quarter road transportation fuel gross profit increased by approximately $168.0 million or 17.2%. Our road transportation fuel gross margin was strong at 42.99¢ per gallon in the United States, an increase of 16.13¢ per gallon, mainly driven by a decline in fuel products costs. In Europe, road transportation fuel margin was US 10.51¢ per liter, an increase of US 2.07¢ per liter, and in Canada, it was CA 10.29¢ per liter, an increase of CA 2.89¢ per liter, driven by changes in the competitive landscape and improved supply conditions.  The road transportation fuel gross margin of our company-operated stores in the United States and the impact of expenses related to electronic payment modes for the last eight quarters, starting with the second quarter of the fiscal year ended April 28, 2019, were as follows:  (US cents per gallon)            Quarter  2nd 3rd 4th 1st Weighted  average 52-week period ended July 19, 2020            Before deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  28.29 27.04 46.88 42.99 34.72 Expenses related to electronic payment modes  4.63 4.54 4.97 4.88 4.72 After deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  23.66 22.50 41.91 38.11 30.00 52-week period ended July 21, 2019            Before deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  21.88 29.42 18.51 26.86 24.53 Expenses related to electronic payment modes  4.55 4.31 4.40 4.70 4.48 After deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  17.33 25.11 14.11 22.16 20.05  Generally, during normal economic cycles, road transportation fuel margins in the United States can be volatile from one quarter to another but have historically trended higher over longer periods. The historical trends for Europe and Canada are similar, while the margin volatility and expenses related to electronic payment modes are not as significant.  Other revenues gross profit  In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, other revenues gross profit was $42.3 million, a decrease of $22.4 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, other revenues gross profit increased by approximately $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.  Operating, selling, administrative and general expenses (""expenses"")  For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, expenses decreased by 5.6%, compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. If we exclude certain items that are not considered indicative of future trends, expenses decreased by 0.3%.      12-week period ended  July 19, 2020 Total variance, as reported  (5.6%) Adjusted for:    Decrease from lower electronic payment fees, excluding acquisitions  2.4% Decrease from the disposal of our interests in CAPL  1.6% Decrease from the net impact of foreign exchange translation  1.2% Impact from the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL, net of electronic payment fees  0.6% Acquisition costs recognized to earnings of fiscal 2021  (0.3%) Increase from incremental expenses related to acquisitions  (0.2%) Remaining variance  (0.3%)  Decrease in expenses was driven by, amongst other items, cost and labor efficiencies, as well as by various measures enacted to streamline and minimize our controllable expenses. These items were partly offset by COVID-19 related expenses, normal inflation, higher labor costs from minimum wage increases in certain regions and incremental investments in our stores to support our strategic initiatives. COVID-19 related expenses include, but are not limited to, an emergency appreciation pay premium of $2.50 per hour in North America for hourly store employees and distribution center employees, Thank you bonuses in North America following the end of the appreciation pay premium, additional cleaning and sanitizing supplies, as well as masks and gloves for our employees. We continue to rigorously focus on controlling costs throughout our organization, while ensuring we maintain the quality of service we offer to our customers.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment (EBITDA) and adjusted EBITDA  During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, EBITDA increased from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, an increase of 27.4% compared with the same quarter last year. Excluding the specific items shown in the table below, the adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased by $320.4 million or 30.8% compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, mainly from higher road transportation fuel gross margins and organic growth, partly offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on our traffic, as well as from the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars. The variation in exchange rates had a net negative impact of approximately $12.0 million.  It should be noted that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not performance measures defined by IFRS, but we, as well as investors and analysts, consider that those performance measures facilitate the evaluation of our ongoing operations and our ability to generate cash flows to fund our cash requirements, including our capital expenditures program and payment of dividends. Note that our definition of these measures may differ from the one used by other public corporations.      12-week periods ended (in millions of US dollars)  July 19, 2020  July 21, 2019 Net earnings including non-controlling interests, as reported  777.1  536.0 Add:        Income taxes  202.7  135.3 Net financial expenses  88.0  87.0 Depreciation, amortization and impairment  289.5  307.1 EBITDA  1,357.3  1,065.4 Adjusted for:        Acquisition costs  3.9  0.2 EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests  —  (24.8) Adjusted EBITDA  1,361.2  1,040.8  Depreciation, amortization and impairment (""depreciation"")  For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our depreciation expense decreased by $17.6 million. Excluding CAPL's results, as well as the net positive impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, the depreciation expense increased by approximately $10.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This increase is mainly driven by the replacement of equipment and the ongoing improvement of our network.  Net financial expenses  Net financial expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $88.0 million, an increase of $1.0 million compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding the items shown in the table below, net financial expenses increased by $0.4 million.      12-week periods ended (in millions of US dollars)  July 19, 2020  July 21, 2019 Net financial expenses, as reported  88.0  87.0 Adjusted for:        Net foreign exchange loss  (18.4)  (6.5) CAPL's financial expenses  —  (11.3) Net financial expenses excluding items above  69.6  69.2  Income taxes  The income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 20.7% compared with 20.2% for the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. The income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 includes an income tax expense of $4.5 million from the re-evaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL. The increase in the income tax rate, excluding the item shown in the table below, is stemming from the impact of a different mix in our earnings across the various jurisdictions in which we operate.      12-week periods ended    July 19, 2020  July 21, 2019 Income tax rate, as reported  20.7%  20.2% Adjusted for:        Income tax expense following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL  —  (0.7)% Income tax rate excluding the item above  20.7%  19.5%  Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (""net earnings"") and adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (""adjusted net earnings"")  Net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $777.1 million, compared with $538.8 million for the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, an increase of $238.3 million or 44.2%. Diluted net earnings per share stood at $0.70, compared with $0.48 for the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. The translation of revenues and expenses from our Canadian and European operations into US dollars had a net negative impact of approximately $8.0 million on net earnings of the first quarter of fiscal 2021.  Excluding the items shown in the table below from net earnings of the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were approximately $795.0 million, compared with $548.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of $247.0 million or 45.1%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.71 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with $0.48 for the corresponding period of fiscal 2020, an increase of 47.9%.

The meeting suggested continuing the Bangladesh missions’ diplomatic efforts to ensure the labour markets for Bangladeshi workers do not shrink.  The parliamentary committee also recommended measures to send the stranded Bangladeshi workers back to their countries of work.  About 80,000 expatriates have returned to Bangladesh or been repatriated from various countries in the last four months amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to the ministry.  The number of people who got stranded after returning home, including those who came back before April, would exceed 275,000, according to non-government organisation BRAC.  The committee heard that the government distributed medicines and relief items worth of Tk 110 million among the expatriate Bangladeshis who have lost their jobs.  The government also took a project financed by the World Bank for the 'reintegration' of the workers returning from abroad."

Adjusted net earnings were approximately $795.0 million 1 compared with $548.0 million 1 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted net earnings per share on a diluted basis were $0.71 1 , representing an increase of 47.9% from $0.48 1 for the corresponding quarter of last year.  Due to the ongoing restrictive social measures in the various geographies in which the Corporation operates, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a meaningful impact on its financial results. On merchandise sales, it benefited from consolidated trips by consumers driving larger basket size. While on the fuel side, as revenues declined from lower demand and lower fuel prices, it was compensated by strong fuel margins.  Total merchandise and service revenues of $3.9 billion, an increase of 7.0%. Same-store merchandise revenues increased 7.7% in the U.S., 3.4% in Europe, and 19.9% in Canada.  Merchandise and service gross margin increased 0.7% in the U.S. to 34.7%, while it decreased 0.9% in Europe to 40.6% and 1.2% in Canada to 31.7%, both negatively impacted by product mix.

LAVAL, QC, Sept. 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - For its first quarter ended July 19, 2020, Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. (""Couche-Tard"" or the ""Corporation"") (TSX: ATD.A) (TSX: ATD.B) announces net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation of $777.1 million, representing $0.70 per share on a diluted basis. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were affected by a pre-tax net foreign exchange loss of $18.4 million, as well as pre-tax acquisition costs of $3.9 million. The results for the comparable quarter of fiscal 2020 were affected by a pre-tax net foreign exchange loss of $6.5 million, an income tax expense of $4.5 million (of which $3.5 million is attributable to shareholders of the Corporation) following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL, as well as pre-tax acquisition costs of $0.2 million. Excluding these items, the adjusted net earnings were approximately $795.0 million1 or $0.711 per share on a diluted basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, compared with $548.0 million1 or $0.481 per share on a diluted basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of 47.9% in the adjusted net earnings per share on a diluted basis, driven by strong growth in merchandise and service and in road transportation fuel gross profit, as well as by good cost control. All financial information presented is in US dollars unless stated otherwise.  Story continues  Alimentation Couche-Tard inc. Logo (CNW Group/Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.)  ""We had an exceptional first quarter, both financially and operationally, as we have seen an increase in shopping occasions and solid execution by our teams to take advantage of the changing consumer behaviors, this led to very strong same-store merchandise sales of 7.7% in the U.S., 19.9% in Canada, and 3.4% in Europe. This growth was due to the gradual reopening of the economies, and to continued strength in the average basket size driven by customer trip consolidation as customers relied more on the proximity and ease of shopping in our locations. Fuel margins remained healthy across the network, and fuel volumes have shown steady improvement since dropping to their low point in spring, especially in Europe where societies have returned to more normal behaviors,"" said Brian Hannasch, President and CEO of Alimentation Couche-Tard.  ""This quarter, we pushed forward our Fresh Food, Fast program in the U.S., where we now have nearly 875 locations up and running, and are moving towards our goal of 1,500 stores this fall. The ease of preparation and notable quality of our products are leading to high customer satisfaction and to increased sales compared to our benchmark non-food stores. We also advanced in our innovation journey with the continued piloting and roll-out of frictionless options for delivery and payment, as well as with our dynamic pricing capabilities both at the fuel pumps and in our stores,"" concluded Brian Hannasch.  Claude Tessier, Chief Financial Officer said, ""We delivered another solid quarter in the face of a challenging and unprecedented macroeconomic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our first quarter performance once again demonstrated the resilience of our agile business model, both from a financial and an operational standpoint. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on maximizing cash flows, by containing costs and reducing non-critical capital expenditures to best navigate the turbulence and emerge from the crisis in a position of strength. I am especially proud of our teams' execution, as we generated record free cash flow and exited the quarter with a healthy leverage ratio and liquidity of nearly $5.8 billion through our available cash and undrawn operating credit facility. We stand ready to invest once again in our operations in support of our five-year growth plan, as the various economies in which we operate gradually ramp-up.""  ____________________________ 1 Please refer to the section ""Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (""net earnings"") and adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (""adjusted net earnings"")"" of this press release for additional information on this performance measure.    2 Please refer to the section ""Summary Analysis of Consolidated Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2021"" of this press release for additional information on these performance measures not defined by IFRS.  Significant Items of the First Quarter of Fiscal 2021  Due to the ongoing restrictive social measures across the various geographies in which we operate, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a meaningful impact on our financial results, mostly driven by declining traffic throughout our network. The impact of lower traffic on the merchandise sales was however more than offset by an increase in the average basket size as consumers consolidated their purchases. From a fuel perspective, volumes generally improved throughout the quarter following the gradual pickup in overall economic activity and fuel margins remained healthy. Lastly, from an operating expense perspective, we have continued to invest in the health and safety of our employees and customers and have successfully gained the trust of our communities which recognize us as a safe shopping destination. These additional costs were fully offset by initiatives implemented across our network to reduce our controllable expenses.      During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we fully repaid the outstanding balance of $1.5 billion borrowed on our operating credit D with available cash. On August 21, 2020, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we fully repaid, at maturity, our CA $300.0 million ($227.1 million) Canadian-dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes issued on August 21, 2013.      On April 28, 2020, we invested an additional amount of CA $2.5 million ($1.8 million) in Fire & Flower Holdings Corp. (""Fire & Flower""), which consisted of secured convertible debentures as well as common share purchase warrants. On July 23, 2020, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, amendments to our investments in Fire & Flower were announced, which mainly aimed at modifying the maturity and expiry dates of the financial instruments, as well as their respective conversion and exercise price to a lower strike price or to a market-based price. A commitment to exercise a portion of the common share purchase warrants, for an amount of CA $19.0 million, no later than December 31, 2020, would take effect on the same date as the amendments become effective. As at September 1, 2020, these amendments are still subject to customary conditions precedent and regulatory approvals.  Changes in our Network  During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we closed the fifth transaction of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CrossAmerica Partners LP (""CAPL""). In this fifth transaction, we transferred 29 Circle K U.S. stores for a total value of approximately $32.0 million. In exchange, CAPL transferred the real estate for 13 properties of an equivalent value. The remaining assets of this agreement are expected to be exchanged in the second half of calendar 2020.      During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired one company-operated store.      During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the construction of 16 stores and the relocation or reconstruction of 8 stores. As of July 19, 2020, another 23 stores were under construction and should open in the upcoming quarters.      On August 24, 2020, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired 10 company-operated stores from Wadsworth Oil Company of Clanton, Inc., all located in Alabama, within the United States. We settled this transaction using our available cash and existing credit facilities.

We believe this measure is useful to investors and analysts.  Revenues  Our revenues were $9.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, down by $4.5 billion, a decrease of 31.4% compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. This performance is mainly attributable to the negative impact of COVID-19 on fuel demand, to a lower average road transportation fuel selling price and to the disposal of our interests in CAPL which had an impact of approximately $487.0 million, as well as to the net negative impact from the translation of revenues of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, which had an impact of approximately $165.0 million.  Merchandise and service revenues  Total merchandise and service revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $3.9 billion, an increase of $252.0 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, merchandise and service revenues increased by approximately $304.0 million or 8.5%. This increase is primarily attributable to growth in basket size, which more than offset continued softness in traffic. We saw strength across many categories, especially tobacco products, alcohol, packaged beverages and various grocery items. Same-store merchandise revenues increased by 7.7% in the United States, by 3.4% in Europe, and by 19.9% in Canada.  Road transportation fuel revenues  Total road transportation fuel revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $5.8 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of revenues of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, road transportation fuel revenues decreased by approximately $4.0 billion or 40.6%. This decrease is mostly attributable to the decrease on fuel demand in relation with the stay-at-home measures implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to a lower average road transportation fuel selling price which had a negative impact of approximately $1.8 billion. Same-store road transportation fuel volume decreased in the United States by 21.2%, in Europe by 12.4%, and in Canada by 25.6%.  The following table shows the average selling price of road transportation fuel of our company-operated stores in our various markets for the last eight quarters, starting with the second quarter of the fiscal year ended April 28, 2019:  Quarter  2nd 3rd 4th 1st Weighted  average 52-week period ended July 19, 2020              United States (US dollars per gallon) – excluding CAPL  2.55 2.51 2.21 2.04 2.36  Europe (US cents per liter)  70.86 73.92 60.95 56.89 66.83  Canada (CA cents per liter)  105.14 103.47 88.78 86.89 97.79 52-week period ended July 21, 2019              United States (US dollars per gallon) – excluding CAPL  2.72 2.42 2.51 2.66 2.57  Europe (US cents per liter)  80.56 75.28 74.59 77.35 76.86  Canada (CA cents per liter)  115.22 97.59 103.45 111.16 106.23  Other revenues  Total other revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $86.6 million, a decrease of $101.9 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, other revenues decreased by approximately $75.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, mainly driven by lower aviation fuel revenues, which had a minimal impact on gross profit.  Gross profit  Our gross profit was $2.5 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, up by $202.0 million, or 8.7% compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020, mainly attributable to higher road transportation fuel gross margins and organic growth, partly offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on fuel demand, by the disposal of our interests in CAPL, which had an impact of approximately $49.0 million, and by the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, which had an impact of approximately $27.0 million.  Merchandise and service gross profit  In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our merchandise and service gross profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of $93.0 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, merchandise and service gross profit increased by approximately $109.0 million or 8.8%, mainly attributable to strong organic growth, despite lower traffic in our network due to COVID-19. Our gross margin increased by 0.7% in the United States to 34.7%, mainly due to strong service revenues, and to an accelerated recognition of deferred credits. Excluding this accelerated recognition, our gross margin would have been stable compared to the corresponding quarter of last year. In Europe and in Canada, the gross margin decreased by 0.9% to 40.6%, and by 1.2% to 31.7%, respectively, both negatively impacted by a shift in product mix towards lower margin categories.  Road transportation fuel gross profit  In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our road transportation fuel gross profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of $131.4 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, our first quarter road transportation fuel gross profit increased by approximately $168.0 million or 17.2%. Our road transportation fuel gross margin was strong at 42.99¢ per gallon in the United States, an increase of 16.13¢ per gallon, mainly driven by a decline in fuel products costs. In Europe, road transportation fuel margin was US 10.51¢ per liter, an increase of US 2.07¢ per liter, and in Canada, it was CA 10.29¢ per liter, an increase of CA 2.89¢ per liter, driven by changes in the competitive landscape and improved supply conditions.  The road transportation fuel gross margin of our company-operated stores in the United States and the impact of expenses related to electronic payment modes for the last eight quarters, starting with the second quarter of the fiscal year ended April 28, 2019, were as follows:  (US cents per gallon)            Quarter  2nd 3rd 4th 1st Weighted  average 52-week period ended July 19, 2020            Before deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  28.29 27.04 46.88 42.99 34.72 Expenses related to electronic payment modes  4.63 4.54 4.97 4.88 4.72 After deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  23.66 22.50 41.91 38.11 30.00 52-week period ended July 21, 2019            Before deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  21.88 29.42 18.51 26.86 24.53 Expenses related to electronic payment modes  4.55 4.31 4.40 4.70 4.48 After deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  17.33 25.11 14.11 22.16 20.05  Generally, during normal economic cycles, road transportation fuel margins in the United States can be volatile from one quarter to another but have historically trended higher over longer periods. The historical trends for Europe and Canada are similar, while the margin volatility and expenses related to electronic payment modes are not as significant.  Other revenues gross profit  In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, other revenues gross profit was $42.3 million, a decrease of $22.4 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, other revenues gross profit increased by approximately $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.  Operating, selling, administrative and general expenses (""expenses"")  For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, expenses decreased by 5.6%, compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. If we exclude certain items that are not considered indicative of future trends, expenses decreased by 0.3%.      12-week period ended  July 19, 2020 Total variance, as reported  (5.6%) Adjusted for:    Decrease from lower electronic payment fees, excluding acquisitions  2.4% Decrease from the disposal of our interests in CAPL  1.6% Decrease from the net impact of foreign exchange translation  1.2% Impact from the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL, net of electronic payment fees  0.6% Acquisition costs recognized to earnings of fiscal 2021  (0.3%) Increase from incremental expenses related to acquisitions  (0.2%) Remaining variance  (0.3%)  Decrease in expenses was driven by, amongst other items, cost and labor efficiencies, as well as by various measures enacted to streamline and minimize our controllable expenses. These items were partly offset by COVID-19 related expenses, normal inflation, higher labor costs from minimum wage increases in certain regions and incremental investments in our stores to support our strategic initiatives. COVID-19 related expenses include, but are not limited to, an emergency appreciation pay premium of $2.50 per hour in North America for hourly store employees and distribution center employees, Thank you bonuses in North America following the end of the appreciation pay premium, additional cleaning and sanitizing supplies, as well as masks and gloves for our employees. We continue to rigorously focus on controlling costs throughout our organization, while ensuring we maintain the quality of service we offer to our customers.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment (EBITDA) and adjusted EBITDA  During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, EBITDA increased from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, an increase of 27.4% compared with the same quarter last year. Excluding the specific items shown in the table below, the adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased by $320.4 million or 30.8% compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, mainly from higher road transportation fuel gross margins and organic growth, partly offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on our traffic, as well as from the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars. The variation in exchange rates had a net negative impact of approximately $12.0 million.  It should be noted that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not performance measures defined by IFRS, but we, as well as investors and analysts, consider that those performance measures facilitate the evaluation of our ongoing operations and our ability to generate cash flows to fund our cash requirements, including our capital expenditures program and payment of dividends. Note that our definition of these measures may differ from the one used by other public corporations.      12-week periods ended (in millions of US dollars)  July 19, 2020  July 21, 2019 Net earnings including non-controlling interests, as reported  777.1  536.0 Add:        Income taxes  202.7  135.3 Net financial expenses  88.0  87.0 Depreciation, amortization and impairment  289.5  307.1 EBITDA  1,357.3  1,065.4 Adjusted for:        Acquisition costs  3.9  0.2 EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests  —  (24.8) Adjusted EBITDA  1,361.2  1,040.8  Depreciation, amortization and impairment (""depreciation"")  For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our depreciation expense decreased by $17.6 million. Excluding CAPL's results, as well as the net positive impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, the depreciation expense increased by approximately $10.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This increase is mainly driven by the replacement of equipment and the ongoing improvement of our network.  Net financial expenses  Net financial expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $88.0 million, an increase of $1.0 million compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding the items shown in the table below, net financial expenses increased by $0.4 million.      12-week periods ended (in millions of US dollars)  July 19, 2020  July 21, 2019 Net financial expenses, as reported  88.0  87.0 Adjusted for:        Net foreign exchange loss  (18.4)  (6.5) CAPL's financial expenses  —  (11.3) Net financial expenses excluding items above  69.6  69.2  Income taxes  The income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 20.7% compared with 20.2% for the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. The income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 includes an income tax expense of $4.5 million from the re-evaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL. The increase in the income tax rate, excluding the item shown in the table below, is stemming from the impact of a different mix in our earnings across the various jurisdictions in which we operate.      12-week periods ended    July 19, 2020  July 21, 2019 Income tax rate, as reported  20.7%  20.2% Adjusted for:        Income tax expense following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL  —  (0.7)% Income tax rate excluding the item above  20.7%  19.5%  Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (""net earnings"") and adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (""adjusted net earnings"")  Net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $777.1 million, compared with $538.8 million for the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, an increase of $238.3 million or 44.2%. Diluted net earnings per share stood at $0.70, compared with $0.48 for the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. The translation of revenues and expenses from our Canadian and European operations into US dollars had a net negative impact of approximately $8.0 million on net earnings of the first quarter of fiscal 2021.  Excluding the items shown in the table below from net earnings of the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were approximately $795.0 million, compared with $548.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of $247.0 million or 45.1%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.71 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with $0.48 for the corresponding period of fiscal 2020, an increase of 47.9%.  The table below reconciles reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings:      12-week periods ended (in millions of US dollars)  July 19, 2020  July 21, 2019 Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation, as reported  777.1  538.8 Adjusted for:        Net foreign exchange loss  18.4  6.5 Acquisition costs  3.9  0.2 Income tax expense following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL  —  3.5 Tax impact of the items above and rounding  (4.4)  (1.0) Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation  795.0  548.0  It should be noted that adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings are not performance measures defined by IFRS, but we, as well as investors and analysts, consider these measures useful for evaluating the underlying performance of our operations on a comparable basis. Note that our definition of these measures may differ from the one used by other public corporations.  Dividends  During its September 1, 2020 meeting, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of CA 7.0¢ per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to shareholders on record as at September 11, 2020, and approved its payment for September 25, 2020. This is an eligible dividend within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada).  Profile  Couche-Tard is the leader in the Canadian convenience store industry.

In just six months, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our world dramatically. As we adapt, we are learning about the virus—especially the possibility that transient immunity could expose people to waves of the virus—and about long-term effects on the lungs, heart, kidneys, and brain among those who recover.  Despite these unknowns, COVID-19 has exposed several well-known and deeply persisting inequalities. People with comorbidities such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease and diabetes are at a higher risk of complications from COVID-19, and these risk factors disproportionately affect those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.  Women bear the brunt of caring for the sick and children, are at high risk of domestic violence during quarantines and lockdowns, and are affected by disruptions in access to sexual and reproductive health services, as well as by job losses in the informal sector.  To make matters worse, another pandemic can strike at any time, even as we struggle with the current crisis.  This pandemic has also laid bare inequality between rich and poor countries. For the most part, rich countries have better-funded health systems and can afford to temporarily freeze their economies and inject billions of dollars into economic stimulus packages. Yet most poor countries have underfunded and inadequately staffed health systems, weak water and sanitation systems, large populations, mounting debt, colossal unemployment, and limited fiscal capacity for economic relief.  To make matters worse, another pandemic can strike at any time, even as we struggle with the current crisis. Apart from looming global pandemics, there is also the threat of extreme weather events and natural disasters, as well as recurring economic crises, all of which have devastating effects on communities and health systems.  During all of these natural and human-caused crises, it is a country’s health system that is the first line of defense, and if the system is not resilient, it will be overwhelmed and collapse, exacerbating the health impact and adding to inequality. Countries such as Germany, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan Province of China, and Vietnam—all of which have managed to control COVID-19 better than others—have demonstrated resilience in their health systems.  Resilient health systems  Harvard public health professor Margaret Kruk defines health system resilience as “the capacity of health actors, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises; maintain core functions when a crisis hits; and, informed by lessons learned during the crisis, reorganize if conditions require it” (Kruk and others 2015). In the face of a crisis, a resilient health system can cope with the shock, continue to provide services, and return to normal functioning once the crisis settles, thereby delivering positive health outcomes in both good and bad times.  However, a health system does not function in a silo; it operates within a socioeconomic and political context, clearly reflected by the direct and indirect health effects of pandemics and other shocks on vulnerable populations. A resilient post–COVID-19 health system must also address these vulnerabilities and inequalities and sustainably respond to a range of crises in the future.  Based on the growing literature and country experiences of Ebola and COVID-19, we can outline five broad features of a resilient national health system.  First, it must be vigilant. Countries must strengthen their existing disease surveillance systems to routinely collect and analyze information across public and private health care in order to prevent or quell outbreaks. Several simple and effective disease surveillance systems have been developed and adapted in low-resource settings. For instance, in the early 1980s, virologist T. Jacob John established a novel system in south India using a standardized set of symptoms (which would today be called “syndromic surveillance”) to detect and limit disease outbreaks (John and others 1998). This national surveillance system must also incrementally build its capacity to routinely monitor such events in neighboring countries and regions and worldwide, which requires capacity building as well as diplomacy.  Second, it must be responsive. Early response is a defining feature of the health systems of Germany, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan Province of China, as well as in states such as Kerala in India—all of which have managed to control COVID-19 effectively. Responsiveness calls for preparedness, which can take years of planning and investment, long before a pandemic hits. Singapore and Taiwan Province of China responded to the deadly 2003 SARS outbreak with elaborate response plans and annual drills in hospitals, while in South Korea, following the 2015 MERS outbreak, the government invested heavily in standard operating protocols and incentivized its biomedical companies to research and develop rapid diagnostic tools. Countries may have emergency preparedness plans and protocols, but these need to be aligned with dedicated individuals and teams with decision-making autonomy to respond swiftly, as well as with investment to strengthen the health infrastructure and a workforce and procedures for emergency procurement and replenishment in the event of shortages.  Third, it must be flexible and adaptable. Hospital staff in several countries have been redeployed to COVID-19 wards. In January and February, nearly 3,000 health workers in Cambodia were trained and deployed to implement rapid detection and contact tracing. In China, Fangcang shelter hospitals were rapidly set up in February 2020—large-scale venues such as stadiums and exhibition centers were converted to temporary hospitals to isolate and care for people with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and reduce the burden on hospitals. Across the world, hospitals have shifted some of their health services to virtual forums such as telephone and video consultations. Such practices show the potential of flexible use of existing resources—whether the workforce or health care facilities—and adaptation to a rapidly changing situation.  Fourth, it is only as resilient as the communities it serves. District public health teams must engage and involve local leaders and community volunteers in structured roles during emergencies; extension of roles during normal times could enhance participatory governance. In Thailand, more than 1 million village health volunteers have monitored communities for COVID-19. In Kerala more the 300,000 youth volunteers were trained and deployed by the government to deliver social services to local communities during the lockdown and support quarantined households (WHO 2020). Local leaders and volunteers are trusted in their communities, and when district health teams partner with such stakeholders it can ensure two-way communication and persuade communities to adopt recommended behavior.  Fifth, and most important, resilient health systems must be equitable. People in both rich and poor countries without effective health coverage have struggled to get tested and seek timely treatment for COVID-19 and other health emergencies. Universal health coverage, regardless of socioeconomic status, geographic location, gender, age, or preexisting conditions, is needed now more than ever (WHO 2010). Countries must invest in universal health coverage, particularly by expanding health insurance coverage and strengthening primary health care services, to ensure early detection and response to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. This will prevent secondary and tertiary health facilities from being overburdened and disrupting the delivery of other essential health services. Most important, universal health coverage will keep families from falling into poverty during such public health emergencies.  Governance holds the key to an effective response for resilient health systems in the face of COVID- 19 and future public health emergencies.  Govenments will also have to strengthen three cross-cutting areas to ensure health system resilience. First, a multisectoral government approach is urgently needed, whereby mechanisms are built and activated for health policymakers to work closely with their counterparts in other relevant public sectors, including education, social welfare, finance and trade, and the environment.  Partnership with the private health sector is the second cross-cutting task. In several low- and middle-income countries, private facilities are the first health care contact point and deliver the bulk of services. This sector cannot be ignored and must be sustainably engaged under public stewardship.  Third, clear, consistent, transparent, and timely communication is needed through various channels, including credible voices for both internal (public sector departments) and external (public) audiences. These communication channels must include and incorporate feedback. Good communication will build public trust in government and encourage adherence to the behavior needed to disrupt transmission and control outbreaks.  Making it happen  Financing is critical to achieving the above features in cross-cutting areas of health system resilience. Governments must increase domestic financial resources for the public health system through mechanisms such as budget reallocation, tax reform and management, and luxury and sin taxes as well as collaboration with the private and philanthropic sectors. In 2013, within one year of introducing sin taxes on alcohol and tobacco, the Philippines generated $1.2 billion, which made it possible to enroll an additional 45 million citizens in universal health coverage.  Governments can also make a substantial difference by reducing inefficiencies in their health spending. This can be achieved through strategies such as reforming incentive and payment structures to address overuse of services, controlling excessive markups on medicines and promoting generics, pooled medicine purchases, and addressing corruption.  Poorer countries suffering from economic shocks will have a hard time raising money for domestic health financing, which is why we urgently need a coordinated global response. Richer countries, donors, and multilateral agencies must step up development assistance. Institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF have taken initial steps with increased emergency financing, debt relief, and support for debt service suspension. Future support beyond unconditional emergency financing should support broad health system strengthening and resilience and protect social spending and safety nets for the most vulnerable.  Governance holds the key to an effective response for resilient health systems in the face of COVID-19 and future public health emergencies. Effective governance calls for committed leadership across political parties and structures that reflect accountability and transparency, as well as mechanisms for decision-making autonomy and incentives for public health officials across all levels of government.  Worldwide commitment to cooperation on COVID-19 vaccines and therapies starts with collective support for the World Health Organization (WHO). Despite its shortcomings, no other international agency has the technical, normative, and convening capacity to bring countries together at the same table for ensuring equitable access to global public goods for public health emergencies. With the recent US announcement to withdraw from the WHO and threats to overall funding, international cooperation, as demonstrated at the World Health Assembly in May 2020, is more relevant than ever (Sridhar and King 2020).  As former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said, “Coronavirus anywhere is a threat to people everywhere.” No government can completely resolve the COVID-19 crisis alone; it takes global cooperation and solidarity.

Advertisement  In a scene unimaginable to Americans 50 and perhaps even 30 years ago, on March 4 the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier docked at Da Nang, Vietnam – where the first American troops arrived in 1965 – to commemorate 25 years of U.S.-Vietnam relations. The Roosevelt is the second U.S. aircraft carrier to dock in Vietnam since the war; the first, the USS Carl Vinson, did so in 2018.  Vietnam is usually wary of antagonizing China with such U.S. cooperation, but the Hanoi leadership seemingly decided it necessary to bring the Americans ashore at this moment, given China’s unrelenting militarization of the South China Sea.  The rest of Southeast Asia, however, does not echo Vietnam’s relative American affinity. Thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s antagonism and diplomatic distance, regional confidence in the United States has declined: Southeast Asians now believe that China has more regional power and influence than the United States and will have considerably more in ten years.  But the region is not lost. The United States can “win back” Southeast Asia by spearheading collective security and multilateral economic efforts there, abandoning the Cold War-like conception of competition with China, and, above all, being patient. Ultimately, the United States can secure its abiding regional interests by stepping up, reforming, and redefining its Southeast Asia strategy – and engaging the region parallel to a rotting Chinese regime.

China occupied the country for almost 1,000 years, until the 10th century, and has intermittently invaded since, leaving the Vietnamese with a healthy distrust of their northern neighbor. Modern China-Vietnam relations thus oscillate between “cooperation and struggle.”  “The Vietnamese can’t trust the Chinese,” said Vietnamese historian Duong Trung Quoc. “We’ve had too much practice.”  Such lacking trust is evident in their current relations. Months after the two countries’ defense ministers met in 2019 to demonstrate their military ties, a former senior Vietnamese foreign ministry official publicly accused China of “intimidation and coercion,” questioning whether Beijing and Hanoi could ever negotiate claims to the South China Sea in “good faith.” Tensions boiled over this April, when a Chinese maritime surveillance vessel sank a Vietnamese fishing boat in the sea.  Advertisement  While the Vietnam War is now history, Vietnam’s struggle against China remains ongoing.  “It will never end,” said one Vietnamese millennial. “With the Chinese, how can it ever end?”  In 2017, 80 percent of Vietnamese deemed China’s power and influence a “major threat.” In 2020, over 95 percent of Vietnamese business, public sector, and civil society elite expressed worry about China’s “growing regional political and strategic influence.”  On the other hand, 84 percent of the Vietnamese public holds favorable opinions of the United States. Of those same elites, over 76 percent said that they welcomed American political and strategic influence. Meanwhile, Washington and Hanoi have become strategic partners in all but name.  But Vietnam, thanks to its long history of Chinese, French, Japanese, and American occupation, hinges its foreign policy on the “three nos”: no formal military alliances; no hosting foreign military bases; no explicit alignment with any single outside actor. And yet, its 2019 defense white paper proclaimed that Vietnam “will consider developing necessary, appropriate defense and military relations with other countries,” signaling some surprising if understated willingness to move more definitively into Washington’s orbit.  If the United States plays its cards right, the Roosevelt’s docking at Da Nang – the Vietnamese city closest to the South China Sea’s disputed waters and islands – could be the first step in such “appropriate” U.S.-Vietnam relations.

The United States has already conducted joint military exercises with Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In September 2019, the United States even launched the first-ever U.S.-ASEAN joint naval exercises, which took place in the South China Sea.  Months later, though, China flexed its muscles there, its coast guard ships escorting dozens of Chinese fishing boats through Indonesian waters. Jakarta carefully deployed warships and four F-16 jet fighters to drive away China – a major investor in Indonesian infrastructure – without escalating tensions.  Advertisement  This episode epitomizes Southeast Asia’s approach to China. The underdeveloped region balks at Chinese aggression, debt-trapping, and failure to involve locals in development projects, but relies on Chinese investment. Geography, China’s might and Southeast Asia’s underdevelopment renders necessary functional relations with the Asian giant.  But Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping is undermining his country’s ascendancy, pushing many Southeast Asian leaders away from Beijing’s proposed “community of common destiny” that “injects a sense of determinism about the inevitability of the intertwined destiny between China and ASEAN member states.”  Xi has replaced China’s collective leadership structure with strongman rule, creating a qualitatively different regime whose foreign policy is impulsive, rather than pragmatic. Xi ended the “Golden Age” of Chinese diplomacy by transforming the country’s soft-spoken envoys into “Wolf Warriors” who publicly quarrel with foreign governments and media to satisfy the nationalist audience watching at home. His foreign policy recklessness is evident in both China’s recent violence in the Indian Himalayas and extension of territorial claims in Bhutan.  Such aggression subverts Chinese efforts to bring Southeast Asia into the Sino-centric “community of common destiny.” Indeed, Beijing’s bombast, coupled with its growing militarization and coercive tendencies, ensures that most of Southeast Asia will keep open its diplomatic options for fears of becoming Chinese vassals. Cambodia and Laos are cautionary tales.  The region yearns for ties with both Beijing and Washington, a position Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has repeatedly made plain. In 2019, he said that while he welcomed proposals for “Indo-Pacific cooperation,” these plans must not “create rival blocs, deepen fault lines or force countries to take sides.”  Unfortunately, the Trump administration has ignored Southeast Asia’s bicephalous hopes to unwisely imply the existence of Cold War-like rival blocs and thus a binary choice between Washington and Beijing, even though the international landscape is not comparable to the Soviet era, and even though 21st century China poses a much more daunting challenge than the 20th century Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the security environment today is far more benign than it was then, while middle power countries – like those in Southeast Asia – have far more agency.  Washington’s Cold War paradigm is not only inaccurate but strategically unwise. Southeast Asians are wary of being forced to choose between the two Great Powers, as they were to disastrous effect decades ago. But if forced to choose between China, the nearby and active option, and the increasingly distant and erratic United States, many in Southeast Asia would impassively go with the former, considering it “better to be on the side of the healthy and vigorous bully next door than the distracted hero on the other side of town.”  Backing them into such a decision is clearly not in the American interest.  Still, thanks to China’s initially incompetent handling of COVID-19, along with a litany of other complaints, anti-Chinese sentiment is rising rapidly across Southeast Asia. On the other hand, the region maintains a relative but long-running predilection for the United States.  Winning Back Southeast Asia  Washington can capitalize on this by accepting Southeast Asia’s relatively agnostic approach to the great powers and pursuing closer ties with the region nonetheless, particularly in reference to security and economic cooperation.  The United States retains a network of Asian friends, while China has very few, on which it can lean to build collective security. Washington can and should also extend implicit protection guarantees like those it has provided Singapore and Taiwan.  Advertisement  Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.  China’s increasing belligerence actually renders American security offers all the more attractive. For instance, while the Philippines in February notified the United States of its plans to withdraw their bilateral visiting forces treaty, in what was seen as a major coup for Beijing, President Rodrigo Duterte effectively restored the accord with the United States in June after Chinese aggression in the Philippines’ South China Sea waters.  The United States faces a more uphill climb on the economic front.  “Whether we like it or not,” Southeast Asians “have to go to the Chinese” for infrastructure investment, per former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. China is indeed the largest bilateral infrastructure financier in the region, its projects totaling $42 billion from 2008-2016. All 10 ASEAN members have signed on to China’s $1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).  Rather than directly confront the BRI – a doomed pursuit, given Xi’s seemingly-unending ability to marshal state funds – the United States must develop compelling alternatives to it. American coordination with Japan and Australia on regional infrastructure investment is promising, as are multilateral partnerships (like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Trump abandoned) that allow Southeast Asian nations to benefit from U.S. engagement without forsaking Chinese investment.  But Trump himself has undermined the American position. His anti-Muslim rhetoric alienated Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei; Mahathir even asked him “to resign to save America.”  Trump has also aggravated non-Muslim countries by berating and sanctioning them over negligible issues like deportations. His bizarre 2017 White House meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc is a prime example. In this meeting, the president only raised three things – North Korea, the trade deficit, and, remarkably, U.S. deportations of war refugees with criminal convictions to Vietnam – with the prime minister, Ted Osius, the former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, told me in 2018 in Ho Chí Minh City.  The administration also absurdly threatened to sanction Vietnam for refusing to repatriate these war refugees – who are explicitly exempted from deportation by a 2008 bilateral agreement signed by the George W. Bush administration – and later sanctioned both Cambodia and Laos for refusing to accept an adequate number of deportees (also mainly war refugees with criminal convictions).  “It was shooting ourselves in the foot,” Osius said of Trump’s posturing on Vietnam.  Amid this unneeded antagonism, the Trump administration has also indefensibly left empty U.S. ambassadorships to ASEAN, the Philippines, Singapore, and Myanmar. In a region where benevolently “showing up” is half the battle, the United States under Trump has exhibited unnecessary enmity and chronic absenteeism.  But these self-inflicted wounds are not fatal. Sixty percent of U.S.-skeptical regional elites say that their confidence in the United States would increase if Trump were no longer president. A Joe Biden administration could repair this lacking trust, but a Biden reorientation to Southeast Asia – besides avoiding Trump-like negligence – must comprise both sustained pressure on China and engagement alongside it in the region.  The United States retains one key advantage on this front: It can promise middle powers their cherished autonomy, which China, with its explicitly Sino-centric and -serving world order, cannot. Washington makes requests of its partners; the Beijing regime, like its imperial predecessor, considers itself the seat of a superior civilization and thus expects outright deference from its subordinates.  This arrogance, coupled with Xi’s growing impetuousness, inflames anti-Chinese sentiment in Southeast Asia and keeps the region on the alert and, for now, out of Beijing’s proposed “community of common destiny.”  Paradoxically, the United States can cement its regional influence by engaging and contemporarily coexisting alongside rather than directly competing against China. Washington’s success, however, requires not only a new president, but an embrace of the equanimity that once served its former foes in Vietnam so well.  “Chậm mà chắc,” the Vietnamese proverb proclaims. “Slowly, but surely.”  Charles Dunst is an associate at LSE IDEAS, the London School of Economics’ foreign policy think tank, and a journalist who has reported from Southeast Asia for The New York Times, The Atlantic, the Los Angeles Times, and Foreign Policy."

LAVAL, QC, Sept. 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - For its first quarter ended July 19, 2020, Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. (""Couche-Tard"" or the ""Corporation"") (TSX: ATD.A) (TSX: ATD.B) announces net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation of $777.1 million, representing $0.70 per share on a diluted basis. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were affected by a pre-tax net foreign exchange loss of $18.4 million, as well as pre-tax acquisition costs of $3.9 million. The results for the comparable quarter of fiscal 2020 were affected by a pre-tax net foreign exchange loss of $6.5 million, an income tax expense of $4.5 million (of which $3.5 million is attributable to shareholders of the Corporation) following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL, as well as pre-tax acquisition costs of $0.2 million. Excluding these items, the adjusted net earnings were approximately $795.0 million1 or $0.711 per share on a diluted basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, compared with $548.0 million1 or $0.481 per share on a diluted basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of 47.9% in the adjusted net earnings per share on a diluted basis, driven by strong growth in merchandise and service and in road transportation fuel gross profit, as well as by good cost control. All financial information presented is in US dollars unless stated otherwise.  ""We had an exceptional first quarter, both financially and operationally, as we have seen an increase in shopping occasions and solid execution by our teams to take advantage of the changing consumer behaviors, this led to very strong same-store merchandise sales of 7.7% in the U.S., 19.9% in Canada, and 3.4% in Europe. This growth was due to the gradual reopening of the economies, and to continued strength in the average basket size driven by customer trip consolidation as customers relied more on the proximity and ease of shopping in our locations. Fuel margins remained healthy across the network, and fuel volumes have shown steady improvement since dropping to their low point in spring, especially in Europe where societies have returned to more normal behaviors,"" said Brian Hannasch, President and CEO of Alimentation Couche-Tard.  ""This quarter, we pushed forward our Fresh Food, Fast program in the U.S., where we now have nearly 875 locations up and running, and are moving towards our goal of 1,500 stores this fall. The ease of preparation and notable quality of our products are leading to high customer satisfaction and to increased sales compared to our benchmark non-food stores. We also advanced in our innovation journey with the continued piloting and roll-out of frictionless options for delivery and payment, as well as with our dynamic pricing capabilities both at the fuel pumps and in our stores,"" concluded Brian Hannasch.  Claude Tessier, Chief Financial Officer said, ""We delivered another solid quarter in the face of a challenging and unprecedented macroeconomic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our first quarter performance once again demonstrated the resilience of our agile business model, both from a financial and an operational standpoint. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on maximizing cash flows, by containing costs and reducing non-critical capital expenditures to best navigate the turbulence and emerge from the crisis in a position of strength. I am especially proud of our teams' execution, as we generated record free cash flow and exited the quarter with a healthy leverage ratio and liquidity of nearly $5.8 billion through our available cash and undrawn operating credit facility. We stand ready to invest once again in our operations in support of our five-year growth plan, as the various economies in which we operate gradually ramp-up.""  ____________________________ 1 Please refer to the section ""Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (""net earnings"") and adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (""adjusted net earnings"")"" of this press release for additional information on this performance measure.    2 Please refer to the section ""Summary Analysis of Consolidated Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2021"" of this press release for additional information on these performance measures not defined by IFRS.  Significant Items of the First Quarter of Fiscal 2021  Due to the ongoing restrictive social measures across the various geographies in which we operate, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a meaningful impact on our financial results, mostly driven by declining traffic throughout our network. The impact of lower traffic on the merchandise sales was however more than offset by an increase in the average basket size as consumers consolidated their purchases. From a fuel perspective, volumes generally improved throughout the quarter following the gradual pickup in overall economic activity and fuel margins remained healthy. Lastly, from an operating expense perspective, we have continued to invest in the health and safety of our employees and customers and have successfully gained the trust of our communities which recognize us as a safe shopping destination. These additional costs were fully offset by initiatives implemented across our network to reduce our controllable expenses.      During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we fully repaid the outstanding balance of $1.5 billion borrowed on our operating credit D with available cash. On August 21, 2020 , subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we fully repaid, at maturity, our CA $300.0 million ( $227.1 million ) Canadian-dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes issued on August 21, 2013 .      borrowed on our operating credit D with available cash. On , subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we fully repaid, at maturity, our CA ( ) Canadian-dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes issued on . On April 28, 2020 , we invested an additional amount of CA $2.5 million ( $1.8 million ) in Fire & Flower Holdings Corp. (""Fire & Flower""), which consisted of secured convertible debentures as well as common share purchase warrants. On July 23, 2020 , subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, amendments to our investments in Fire & Flower were announced, which mainly aimed at modifying the maturity and expiry dates of the financial instruments, as well as their respective conversion and exercise price to a lower strike price or to a market-based price. A commitment to exercise a portion of the common share purchase warrants, for an amount of CA $19.0 million , no later than December 31, 2020 , would take effect on the same date as the amendments become effective. As at September 1, 2020 , these amendments are still subject to customary conditions precedent and regulatory approvals.  Changes in our Network  During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we closed the fifth transaction of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CrossAmerica Partners LP (""CAPL""). In this fifth transaction, we transferred 29 Circle K U.S. stores for a total value of approximately $32.0 million .

We believe this measure is useful to investors and analysts.  Revenues  Our revenues were $9.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, down by $4.5 billion, a decrease of 31.4% compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. This performance is mainly attributable to the negative impact of COVID-19 on fuel demand, to a lower average road transportation fuel selling price and to the disposal of our interests in CAPL which had an impact of approximately $487.0 million, as well as to the net negative impact from the translation of revenues of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, which had an impact of approximately $165.0 million.  Merchandise and service revenues  Total merchandise and service revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $3.9 billion, an increase of $252.0 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, merchandise and service revenues increased by approximately $304.0 million or 8.5%. This increase is primarily attributable to growth in basket size, which more than offset continued softness in traffic. We saw strength across many categories, especially tobacco products, alcohol, packaged beverages and various grocery items. Same-store merchandise revenues increased by 7.7% in the United States, by 3.4% in Europe, and by 19.9% in Canada.  Road transportation fuel revenues  Total road transportation fuel revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $5.8 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of revenues of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, road transportation fuel revenues decreased by approximately $4.0 billion or 40.6%. This decrease is mostly attributable to the decrease on fuel demand in relation with the stay-at-home measures implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to a lower average road transportation fuel selling price which had a negative impact of approximately $1.8 billion. Same-store road transportation fuel volume decreased in the United States by 21.2%, in Europe by 12.4%, and in Canada by 25.6%.  The following table shows the average selling price of road transportation fuel of our company-operated stores in our various markets for the last eight quarters, starting with the second quarter of the fiscal year ended April 28, 2019:  Quarter  2nd 3rd 4th 1st Weighted  average 52-week period ended July 19, 2020              United States (US dollars per gallon) – excluding CAPL  2.55 2.51 2.21 2.04 2.36  Europe (US cents per liter)  70.86 73.92 60.95 56.89 66.83  Canada (CA cents per liter)  105.14 103.47 88.78 86.89 97.79 52-week period ended July 21, 2019              United States (US dollars per gallon) – excluding CAPL  2.72 2.42 2.51 2.66 2.57  Europe (US cents per liter)  80.56 75.28 74.59 77.35 76.86  Canada (CA cents per liter)  115.22 97.59 103.45 111.16 106.23  Other revenues  Total other revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $86.6 million, a decrease of $101.9 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, other revenues decreased by approximately $75.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, mainly driven by lower aviation fuel revenues, which had a minimal impact on gross profit.  Gross profit  Our gross profit was $2.5 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, up by $202.0 million, or 8.7% compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020, mainly attributable to higher road transportation fuel gross margins and organic growth, partly offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on fuel demand, by the disposal of our interests in CAPL, which had an impact of approximately $49.0 million, and by the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, which had an impact of approximately $27.0 million.  Merchandise and service gross profit  In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our merchandise and service gross profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of $93.0 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, merchandise and service gross profit increased by approximately $109.0 million or 8.8%, mainly attributable to strong organic growth, despite lower traffic in our network due to COVID-19. Our gross margin increased by 0.7% in the United States to 34.7%, mainly due to strong service revenues, and to an accelerated recognition of deferred credits. Excluding this accelerated recognition, our gross margin would have been stable compared to the corresponding quarter of last year. In Europe and in Canada, the gross margin decreased by 0.9% to 40.6%, and by 1.2% to 31.7%, respectively, both negatively impacted by a shift in product mix towards lower margin categories.  Road transportation fuel gross profit  In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our road transportation fuel gross profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of $131.4 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, our first quarter road transportation fuel gross profit increased by approximately $168.0 million or 17.2%. Our road transportation fuel gross margin was strong at 42.99¢ per gallon in the United States, an increase of 16.13¢ per gallon, mainly driven by a decline in fuel products costs. In Europe, road transportation fuel margin was US 10.51¢ per liter, an increase of US 2.07¢ per liter, and in Canada, it was CA 10.29¢ per liter, an increase of CA 2.89¢ per liter, driven by changes in the competitive landscape and improved supply conditions.  The road transportation fuel gross margin of our company-operated stores in the United States and the impact of expenses related to electronic payment modes for the last eight quarters, starting with the second quarter of the fiscal year ended April 28, 2019, were as follows:  (US cents per gallon)            Quarter  2nd 3rd 4th 1st Weighted  average 52-week period ended July 19, 2020            Before deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  28.29 27.04 46.88 42.99 34.72 Expenses related to electronic payment modes  4.63 4.54 4.97 4.88 4.72 After deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  23.66 22.50 41.91 38.11 30.00 52-week period ended July 21, 2019            Before deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  21.88 29.42 18.51 26.86 24.53 Expenses related to electronic payment modes  4.55 4.31 4.40 4.70 4.48 After deduction of expenses related to electronic payment modes  17.33 25.11 14.11 22.16 20.05  Generally, during normal economic cycles, road transportation fuel margins in the United States can be volatile from one quarter to another but have historically trended higher over longer periods. The historical trends for Europe and Canada are similar, while the margin volatility and expenses related to electronic payment modes are not as significant.  Other revenues gross profit  In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, other revenues gross profit was $42.3 million, a decrease of $22.4 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, other revenues gross profit increased by approximately $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.  Operating, selling, administrative and general expenses (""expenses"")  For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, expenses decreased by 5.6%, compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. If we exclude certain items that are not considered indicative of future trends, expenses decreased by 0.3%.      12-week period ended  July 19, 2020 Total variance, as reported  (5.6%) Adjusted for:    Decrease from lower electronic payment fees, excluding acquisitions  2.4% Decrease from the disposal of our interests in CAPL  1.6% Decrease from the net impact of foreign exchange translation  1.2% Impact from the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL, net of electronic payment fees  0.6% Acquisition costs recognized to earnings of fiscal 2021  (0.3%) Increase from incremental expenses related to acquisitions  (0.2%) Remaining variance  (0.3%)  Decrease in expenses was driven by, amongst other items, cost and labor efficiencies, as well as by various measures enacted to streamline and minimize our controllable expenses. These items were partly offset by COVID-19 related expenses, normal inflation, higher labor costs from minimum wage increases in certain regions and incremental investments in our stores to support our strategic initiatives. COVID-19 related expenses include, but are not limited to, an emergency appreciation pay premium of $2.50 per hour in North America for hourly store employees and distribution center employees, Thank you bonuses in North America following the end of the appreciation pay premium, additional cleaning and sanitizing supplies, as well as masks and gloves for our employees. We continue to rigorously focus on controlling costs throughout our organization, while ensuring we maintain the quality of service we offer to our customers.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment (EBITDA) and adjusted EBITDA  During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, EBITDA increased from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, an increase of 27.4% compared with the same quarter last year. Excluding the specific items shown in the table below, the adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased by $320.4 million or 30.8% compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, mainly from higher road transportation fuel gross margins and organic growth, partly offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on our traffic, as well as from the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars. The variation in exchange rates had a net negative impact of approximately $12.0 million.  It should be noted that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not performance measures defined by IFRS, but we, as well as investors and analysts, consider that those performance measures facilitate the evaluation of our ongoing operations and our ability to generate cash flows to fund our cash requirements, including our capital expenditures program and payment of dividends. Note that our definition of these measures may differ from the one used by other public corporations.      12-week periods ended (in millions of US dollars)  July 19, 2020  July 21, 2019 Net earnings including non-controlling interests, as reported  777.1  536.0 Add:        Income taxes  202.7  135.3 Net financial expenses  88.0  87.0 Depreciation, amortization and impairment  289.5  307.1 EBITDA  1,357.3  1,065.4 Adjusted for:        Acquisition costs  3.9  0.2 EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests  —  (24.8) Adjusted EBITDA  1,361.2  1,040.8  Depreciation, amortization and impairment (""depreciation"")  For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our depreciation expense decreased by $17.6 million. Excluding CAPL's results, as well as the net positive impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, the depreciation expense increased by approximately $10.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This increase is mainly driven by the replacement of equipment and the ongoing improvement of our network.  Net financial expenses  Net financial expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $88.0 million, an increase of $1.0 million compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding the items shown in the table below, net financial expenses increased by $0.4 million.      12-week periods ended (in millions of US dollars)  July 19, 2020  July 21, 2019 Net financial expenses, as reported  88.0  87.0 Adjusted for:        Net foreign exchange loss  (18.4)  (6.5) CAPL's financial expenses  —  (11.3) Net financial expenses excluding items above  69.6  69.2  Income taxes  The income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 20.7% compared with 20.2% for the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. The income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 includes an income tax expense of $4.5 million from the re-evaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL. The increase in the income tax rate, excluding the item shown in the table below, is stemming from the impact of a different mix in our earnings across the various jurisdictions in which we operate.      12-week periods ended    July 19, 2020  July 21, 2019 Income tax rate, as reported  20.7%  20.2% Adjusted for:        Income tax expense following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL  —  (0.7)% Income tax rate excluding the item above  20.7%  19.5%  Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (""net earnings"") and adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (""adjusted net earnings"")  Net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $777.1 million, compared with $538.8 million for the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, an increase of $238.3 million or 44.2%. Diluted net earnings per share stood at $0.70, compared with $0.48 for the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. The translation of revenues and expenses from our Canadian and European operations into US dollars had a net negative impact of approximately $8.0 million on net earnings of the first quarter of fiscal 2021.  Excluding the items shown in the table below from net earnings of the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were approximately $795.0 million, compared with $548.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of $247.0 million or 45.1%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.71 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with $0.48 for the corresponding period of fiscal 2020, an increase of 47.9%.  The table below reconciles reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings:      12-week periods ended (in millions of US dollars)  July 19, 2020  July 21, 2019 Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation, as reported  777.1  538.8 Adjusted for:        Net foreign exchange loss  18.4  6.5 Acquisition costs  3.9  0.2 Income tax expense following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL  —  3.5 Tax impact of the items above and rounding  (4.4)  (1.0) Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation  795.0  548.0  It should be noted that adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings are not performance measures defined by IFRS, but we, as well as investors and analysts, consider these measures useful for evaluating the underlying performance of our operations on a comparable basis. Note that our definition of these measures may differ from the one used by other public corporations.  Dividends  During its September 1, 2020 meeting, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of CA 7.0¢ per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to shareholders on record as at September 11, 2020, and approved its payment for September 25, 2020. This is an eligible dividend within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada).  Profile  Couche-Tard is the leader in the Canadian convenience store industry.

The new C.D.C. guidance is the latest sign of an accelerating race for a vaccine against a disease that has killed more than 184,000 Americans. The documents were sent out last week, the same day that President Trump said in his speech to the Republican National Convention that a vaccine might arrive before the end of the year.  Over the past week, both Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Stephen Hahn, who heads the Food and Drug Administration, have said in interviews with news organizations that a vaccine could be available for certain groups before clinical trials have been completed, if the data were overwhelmingly positive.  Public health experts agree that agencies at all levels of government should urgently prepare for what will eventually be a vast, complex effort to vaccinate hundreds of millions of Americans. But the possibility of a rollout in late October or early November has also heightened concerns that the Trump administration is seeking to rush the distribution of a vaccine — or simply to suggest that one is possible — before Election Day on Nov. 3.  “This timeline of the initial deployment at the end of October is deeply worrisome for the politicization of public health and the potential safety ramifications,” said Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist in Arizona. “It’s hard not to see this as a push for a pre-election vaccine.”  Three documents were sent to public health officials in all states and territories as well as New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston and San Antonio on Aug. 27. They outlined detailed scenarios for distributing two unnamed vaccine candidates — each requiring two doses a few weeks apart — at hospitals, mobile clinics and other facilities offering easy access to the first targeted recipients.  The guidance noted that health care professionals, including long-term-care employees, would be among the first to receive the product, along with other essential workers and national security employees."

The new rules will apply from Thursday to flights from Pakistan, Thailand, Cambodia, Greece, Denmark, Austria, Sweden and Canada, all with low numbers of imported cases of the virus which has hammered global travel.  But travellers would be subject to centralised quarantine on arrival for 14 days and have to take two Covid-19 tests, a Beijing city official told reporters.  “Starting September 3, international passenger flights to Beijing, which previously had their entry points diverted, will gradually resume,” said the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in a statement, without specifying if passengers would have to be nationals of the eight countries.  The easing begins “as epidemic prevention and control becomes normalised”, it said, but stressed a “circuit breaker” would remain and departures from countries where imported cases rose over three could see flights diverted again.  Since late March, Beijing-bound international flights have been diverted to other Chinese cities where passengers are screened for the coronavirus before being allowed to travel on to Beijing, the political heart of the country.  They would then be sent to quarantine facilities.  As of Tuesday, the CAAC said 511 international flights had undergone diversion.  Life in Beijing has largely returned to normal, although temperature tests remain common when entering buildings and some places require people to scan a QR code logging their visit on a ubiquitous health app.  The easing in flight rules comes as the rate of infection slowed to eight reported cases on Wednesday in China — where the first cases of Covid-19 surfaced.  But China remains wary of the risk of an influx of cases from other countries.  Most foreigners are still forbidden entry into the country."

Haider, R.A. Kock) ; National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, Rome, Italy (F. Vairo, G. Ippolito) ; University College London, London (A. Zumla)  Cite This Article  We estimated the weighted mean basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of chikungunya virus based on outbreak size. R 0 was 3.4 (95% CI 2.4–4.2) and varied for 2 primary chikungunya mosquito vectors: 4.1 (95% CI 1.5–6.6) for Aedes aegypti and 2.8 (95% CI 1.8–3.8) for Ae. albopictus.  The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of an infection is the mean number of secondary cases a single infectious person causes in a completely susceptible population. The magnitude of R 0 is used to measure the risk and spread of an epidemic or pandemic. To control an outbreak, the R 0 should be reduced to <1 through interventions, such as vaccination. Because little information is available at the beginning of an epidemic, the estimated R 0 commonly is used to assess public health preparedness needs, the impact of the possible epidemic, and success of the control measures. Information on R 0 often is lacking for emerging diseases like chikungunya, a mosquito-borne viral disease of humans and nonhuman primates.  Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a member of the Alphavirus genus (family Togaviridae) transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, primarily Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are aggressive human biters and the main vectors for CHIKV outbreaks in Asia, where epidemics occur primarily in urban settings (1). Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, on the other hand, feed from several mammals besides humans and are responsible for CHIKV outbreaks in rural and urban areas in Africa (1).  CHIKV outbreaks were reported from >100 countries worldwide during 2014–2019 (2). Epidemiologic understanding of CHIKV changed after outbreaks on the island of La Réunion in the Indian Ocean during 2005–2006, when Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were identified as the outbreak vector (1,3). The global expansion of CHIKV partially is attributed to viral adaptation to this new mosquito vector, which facilitated a mutation in the coding for the envelop protein 1 A226V (E1-A226V) gene of CHIKV, increasing the competence of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes to transmit the virus from mosquitoes to humans (1–3).  In humans, CHIV infection is characterized by sudden onset of intense polyarthralgia, high fever, and skin rash. CHIKV causes debilitating joint pain that can limit daily activities and last a few months to several years (2); progression to the chronic stage (>3 months) occurs in 4.1%–78.6% of cases (4). To estimate R 0 of CHIKV outbreaks, we analyzed empirical data on R 0 available from open sources.  The Study We used the search terms “Basic reproduction number” or “R 0 ” AND “chikungunya” to identify published articles from Google Scholar and PubMed. We identified 11 articles describing estimated R 0 of CHIKV from outbreak data during 2000–2019. We found 5 articles on outbreaks in Africa, all on La Réunion (3,5–8); 1 on an outbreak in Cambodia (1); 2 on outbreaks in Italy (9,10); and 3 on outbreaks in the Americas (11,12; N. Báez-Hernández et al. unpub. data, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/122556v1). The authors estimated R 0 by using mathematical (compartmental) models fitted with respective outbreak data (1,3,5–12). We considered the estimated values comparable and extracted the R 0 from each. We then estimated the weighted mean R 0 of CHIKV based on outbreak size, such as number of reported cases included in the estimation of R 0 in the original article, and further estimated the mean R 0 for different mosquito vectors and E1-A226V gene mutations. The largest CHIKV outbreak occurred on La Réunion and affected 266,000 of the 785,000 inhabitants (3). Several models with differing levels of data estimated the R 0 of the La Réunion outbreaks between 0.89 and 4.1 (3,5–7). The R 0 also was estimated from CHIKV outbreaks in Italy in 2007 (10) and 2017 (9), Cambodia in 2012 (1), Venezuela in 2014 (11), Colombia in 2015 (12), and Mexico in 2015 (N. Báez-Hernández et al. unpub. data, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/122556v1) (Table). We estimated the weighted mean R 0 of CHIKV to be 3.4 (95% CI 2.4–4.2). We analyzed the data and estimated the R 0 for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes separately for outbreaks in which the R 0 of CHIKV was described for each species. We estimated the R 0 to be 4.1 (95% CI 1.5–6.6) for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and 2.8 (95% CI 1.8–3.8) for Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Although the difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.12), we expected a lower R 0 for outbreaks involving Ae. albopictus mosquitoes because this species also feeds on animals, which might have reduced the attack rate on humans and transmission across the population. However, outbreaks associated with Ae. albopictus mosquitoes can be prolonged and the outbreak response can have economic consequences. We estimated the R 0 to be 3.5 (95% CI 1.9–4.9) during outbreaks involving the E1-A226V mutation, which is higher than R 0 of 2.1 from the 2017 outbreak in Italy that did not have the gene mutation. CHIKV infections among humans can have severe health consequences, despite the low case fatality rate. CHIKV infection has 3 stages: acute, postacute, and chronic. The acute phase usually lasts for 1–3 weeks and is characterized by fever, intense myalgia, arthralgia, and symmetric joint pain in both legs that can limit even the simplest daily activities. The postacute stage usually lasts 1–3 months after the acute phase and is characterized by persistent inflammatory arthralgia, arthritis, tenosynovitis, and bursitis. The chronic stage starts after 3 months and can last for months to years after acute infection (2). In a study in Brazil, >68% of persons with CHIKV remained chronically infected for up to 1 year (13). On Réunion Island, a small group of patients had clinical signs for 6 years. Although the reason for persistence is unclear, it might be strain related and associated with the E1-A226V mutation. Therefore, despite being less severe and causing fewer deaths than other mosquitoborne diseases, CHIKV can have lingering physical and psychological consequences for those affected. Infected persons also can experience economic consequences because they might not be able to work for several weeks or more. R 0 does not remain constant. For arboviruses, R 0 can vary based on the density of hosts and vectors; mosquito species, survival, and biting rate; and vector competence and capacity, all of which can depend on environmental and microclimatic factors. Further, the vector competence of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes for CHIKV might be different from that for Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, which could influence outbreak dynamics. For example, 1 study reported the transmission efficiency of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes as 97% and of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes as 83% (14). The outbreaks included in our study occurred in tropical and subtropical countries and in the more temperate climate of Italy. We did not consider climatic conditions during reported outbreaks, which might play a role in determining the size and R 0 of CHIKV outbreaks. We also did not consider the variation of data quality in published articles, except for the outbreak size, which might affect estimated R 0 . However, defining adjustments for data quality would have been difficult and might have introduced unwanted bias.  Conclusions We found the overall mean R 0 for CHIKV was 3.4 (95% CI 2.4–4.2). Our estimated R 0 of 4.1 (95% CI 1.5–6.6) for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes suggests CHIKV could spread rapidly and cause high disease incidence in urban areas, where this species thrives. Our estimated CHIKV R 0 for Ae. albopictus mosquitoes of 2.8 (95% CI 1.5–6.6) was lower than for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. In rural areas, where Ae. albopictus mosquitoes are more prevalent, sylvatic cycles, maintenance of biodiversity including natural mosquito populations, and presence of hosts other than humans might reduce the effects of an outbreak. Early interventions targeting Aedes mosquitoes will be vital to controlling CHIKV outbreaks."

Due to the Covid-19 impact in H2, FY20 PRO was €2,260m, an organic decline of -13.7% and -12.4% reported.  The FY20 organic PRO margin erosion was limited to -131bps, with:  Resilient pricing on Strategic brands: +1%  on Strategic brands: +1% Gross margin contracting -140bps , driven by: Adverse mix linked to Strategic International Brands, especially Martell and Chivas Regal Higher Cost of Goods mainly due to agave price pressure, glass and GNS in India, lower fixed cost absorption, only partially offset by operational excellence savings  , driven by: A&P: +88bps , thanks to very strong mitigation plan in H2  , thanks to very strong mitigation plan in H2 Structure costs: -79bps, with topline decline reducing fixed cost absorption, despite strong cost discipline.

The Net Debt/EBITDA ratio at average rates4 was 3.2x at 30 June 2020.  A dividend of €2.66 is proposed for the Annual General Meeting of 27 November 2020.  Alexandre Ricard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated,  “ The Group has proven very resilient through FY20 and demonstrated its agility and ability to keep its supply chains operational, control costs and manage cash. I would like to take this opportunity to praise the exceptional commitment of our teams during this difficult time.  For FY21, Pernod Ricard expects continued uncertainty and volatility, in particular relating to sanitary conditions and their impact on social gatherings, as well as challenging economic conditions. We anticipate a prolonged downturn in Travel Retail but resilience of the Off-trade in the USA and Europe and sequential improvement in China, India and the On-trade globally.  We will stay the strategic course and accelerate our digital transformation while maintaining strict discipline, with clear, purpose-based investment decisions. We will harness our agility to adjust fast to capture new opportunities. Thanks to our solid fundamentals, our teams and our brand portfolio, I am confident that Pernod Ricard will emerge from this crisis stronger.”  All growth data specified in this press release refers to organic growth (at constant FX and Group structure), unless otherwise stated.

A detailed presentation of FY20 Sales and Results can be downloaded from our website: www.pernod-ricard.com  Audit procedures have been carried out on the financial statements. The Statutory Auditors’ report is being issued.  Definitions and reconciliation of non-IFRS measures to IFRS measures  Pernod Ricard’s management process is based on the following non-IFRS measures which are chosen for planning and reporting. The Group’s management believes these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in understanding the Group’s performance. These non-IFRS measures should be considered as complementary to the comparable IFRS measures and reported movements therein.  Organic growth  Organic growth is calculated after excluding the impacts of exchange rate movements and acquisitions and disposals.  Exchange rates impact is calculated by translating the current year results at the prior year’s exchange rates.  For acquisitions in the current year, the post-acquisition results are excluded from the organic movement calculations. For acquisitions in the prior year, post-acquisition results are included in the prior year but are included in the organic movement calculation from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current year.  Where a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of, or terminated, in the prior year, the Group, in the organic movement calculations, excludes the results for that business from the prior year. For disposals or terminations in the current year, the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year from the date of the disposal or termination.  This measure enables to focus on the performance of the business which is common to both years and which represents those measures that local managers are most directly able to influence.  Profit from recurring operations  Profit from recurring operations corresponds to the operating profit excluding other non-current operating income and expenses.

What’s happening?  BMO earnings were down around 20% and ScotiaBank was down roughly 47%. Then National Bank and Royal Bank were minus one or flat. There is something wrong. Let’s dig a little deeper and see what’s really hiding behind these reports.  Royal Bank (RY) (RY.TO)  Business Model  Royal Bank is the largest bank of the group by market cap (it battles with TD) and provides various financial services to individuals as well as commercial and institutional clients. RY has a strong position in the personal and commercial banking sector (46% of its revenue). In 2015, RY bought City National, a Los Angeles-based bank focused on high net worth clients. The transaction opened US doors and another growth vector: wealth management.  What’s the Story?  “We continue to navigate these uncertain times from a position of strength and stability. Our robust capital and liquidity position, diversified business model, prudent approach to risk management, and technology capabilities provide the foundation to enable our people to continue supporting clients, providing advice and creating more value today and over the long-term,” said Dave McKay, RBC President and Chief Executive Officer. “RBC has a proud history of helping our clients thrive and communities prosper. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, RBCers have shown their unwavering commitment to delivering on our Purpose by enabling the re-emergence of our economies and supporting our clients with empathy and dedication.” Source: RY Press Release  Basically, CEO is telling you “COVID-19 has unknown impacts on the economy, but we’re good banks, so trust us.” What caught my attention was that he mentioned that he’s focusing on prudent approach to risk management. That’s really Royal Bank’s type of statement, saying they’re pretty much sitting on their throne and wait because they’re the biggest bank across Canada along with TD.  Now let’s dig into the numbers.  Net income $3.2B, -2%  Adjusted EPS $2.20, -1%  CET ratio is at 12 (+30 points)  Business as usual, right? But it’s kind of weird during a pandemic crisis! That’s when you find out why. Provision for credit losses is at only 675 million, versus 2.83 billions in April. They were quite aggressive back in April, but they just add another 700 million as provision for losses, which is not too much…  Interesting enough, 7% of RY total loans are vulnerable to COVID-19 economy impacts. BMO and Scotia Bank were between 4% and 5%. Even with more risk exposure, RY chooses to go with a smaller provision for credit losses. Is it a sign that something is wrong or is it just good accounting? We should follow that in the next quarters.  Also, less than 50% of Royal Bank business is concentrated in the classic personal and commercial banking. RY relies a lot more on capital markets, wealth management and insurance to make money, and this is paying off.  Investment Thesis  Over the past 5 years, RY did well because of its smaller divisions acting as growth vectors. The insurance, wealth management, and capital markets push RY revenue. Those sectors combined now represent over 50% of its revenue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these are also the same segments helping Royal Bank to stay the course. Royal Bank also made huge efforts into diversifying its activities outside Canada. Canadian banks are protected by federal regulations, but this limits their growth. Having a foot outside of the country helps RY to reduce risk and to improve growth potential. Royal Bank shows a perfect balance between revenue growth and dividend growth. It’s a keeper.  Potential Risks  After the 2018 financial market crash, the bank put its focus on growing its smaller sectors. While wealth management should continue to post stable income, the insurance and capital markets are more inclined to hectic returns. As the largest Canadian bank, Royal Bank could also get hurt by a bearish housing market. There are some general concerns around Canadian Banks and how they manage their provision for credit losses. RBC loan portfolio has been affected by the pandemic, but provision for credit losses has been smaller for Q3 2020 vs Q2 2020. We will have to wait for this fall to see if the economy will suffer from another virus outbreak.  Dividend Growth Perspective  Royal Bank has a “tradition” of increasing its dividend twice a year. In normal times, you can count on two low-single digit dividend growth per year. It paused its dividend growth policy between 2008 and 2010, but came back with the double dividend growth tradition in 2012. The bank is likely to follow a similar strategy and should pause its dividend growth policy for the rest of 2020 and potentially 2021. We will follow the situation closely. In the meantime, the dividend is safe as the payout ratio remains under control.  National Bank (NA.TO)  Business Model  National Bank is very small compared to the big 5 Canadian banks. As the sixth largest one, NA is mostly in Quebec with 62% of its revenues earned in this province. Its smaller size is currently paying off as National Bank was quicker to develop a strong brand in Wealth Management with Private Banking 1859 and built a highly profitable Financial Market division.  What’s the Story?  “Since the gradual reopening of the economy, many indicators have improved, but the situation remains uncertain, especially given the potential for a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this environment, the Bank is continuing to deploy efforts to support its employees, its clients, and the community,” said Louis Vachon, President and Chief Executive Officer of National Bank of Canada. Source: NA Press Release  Lots of uncertainty, but he’s focusing on a strong position, solid balance sheet, defensive position, and he’s highlighting quality credit portfolio and prudent approach to provising (you can read full statement here).  National Bank did exactly the same as Royal Bank with their provision for credit of losses. They went from 500 millions in April to 143 millions.  According to their presentation, 3.7% of their loan portfolio could be called as vulnerable, which is not too much. However, the energy sector is not included. National Bank seems to be trying to look good. While I get why they do that, it’s a little shaky.  I’m going to go deeper and look into that in the next days and you should too if you are a shareholder.  Now let’s dig into the numbers.  Net income $602M, -0.99%  Adjusted EPS $1.66, flat  CET ratio is at 11.4 (flat)  Again, these results seem questionnable in the actual context. However, NA got growth from international exposure. Obviously, the exposure of international banks for NA is a lot less than ScotiaBank, but last year they completed the purchase of ABA Bank in Cambodia, and this is what brought a lot of this growth for the quarter.  They also have a great financial market and wealth management division, up by 5% and 2%. So far, banks have been dragged by classic personal and commercial banking. Those doing better do it with capital markets wealth management, international exposure or insurance.  Investment Thesis  Like BMO, NA aimed at capital market and wealth management to support its growth. Private Banking 1859 has become a serious player in that area. The bank even opened private banking branch only in Western Canada to capture additional growth. Since NA is heavily concentrated in Quebec, it concluded deals to do credit for investing and insurance firms under the Power Corporation (POW). Branches are currently going through a major transformation with new concepts and enhanced technology to serve clients. While waiting for the results, it seems wise to invest in digital features to reach out to the millennials and improve efficiency. The stock has outperformed the Big 5 for the past decade as it showed strong results. Recently, NA is seeking additional growth vectors by investing in emerging markets such as Cambodia (ABA bank). Can it have more success than BNS on international grounds?  Potential Risks  National Bank is still highly dependent on Quebec’s economy. As a “super-regional” bank, NA is more vulnerable to economic events. So far, the covid-19 situation in Quebec as been well managed and NA posted satisfying results in May 2020. However, we are far from being done with the pandemic. Capital markets revenues are also highly volatile. NA could run into a bad quarter if the stock market enters into a bearish environment. The bank has considerable exposure to the oil market through its commercial loan portfolio. Overall, the bank performs very well, but usually take a little more risk to find growth vectors (such as ABA bank investment and capital markets). So far it has paid well, but it doesn’t mean it will always work.  Dividend Growth Perspective  National Bank offers a generous dividend growth policy. The bank has shown one of the most generous dividends increase in the past 5 years (vs the other Big 5). Not bad considering the company had to take a pause in its increase between 2008 and 2010 due to the financial crisis. The bank should pause its dividend growth policy in 2020 and wait to know the full impact of the pandemic on its loan portfolio. So far, it seems that NA can easily navigate through this challenge. However, we are far from being done and we must wait a few more quarters (ready beginning of 2021) to understand the full impact of the covid-19 on the economy.  Final Thoughts  In both cases, we have a decent payout ratio and a robust balance sheet. I don’t expect any cut from these two banks for the upcoming quarters. They will probably reassess as the economy recovers in 2021, but in the meantime, as an investor, I don’t mind what’s happening. I’m happy with those results, they fit with my investment strategy and my investment thesis for both banks, and I’m just going to keep holding them.  Disclaimer: I do hold shares of NA.TO (NTIOF) and RY."

She offered a bleak view of her country.  I had said, more out of faith, that I thought American institutions were strong enough to withstand Trumpian assaults. I was relying on the history I was familiar with: Washington district judge John Sirica demanding that President Richard Nixon’s administration hand over tapes during the Watergate trials; Republican senator Howard Baker asking about Nixon, “What did the president know and when did he know it?""; leading US newspapers defying the White House and publishing the Pentagon Papers, a leaked report that showed what the Defense Department knew about the Vietnam War and wasn’t revealing; and more recently, former secretary of state Colin Powell, who served under Republican presidents, defending Democrat Barack Obama from rightist smears. In the US, institutions mattered.  To be sure, there was always partisan politics, especially when relations between the executive and legislative branches worsened, with government shutdowns and impeachments of Bill Clinton and Trump. In the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War, the US press did poorly, with some reporters becoming the administration’s cheerleaders, parroting government propaganda. And the judiciary too opted for expediency at times, such as when the Supreme Court enabled George W. Bush’s 2000 election after the poll stalemate in Florida.  My friend was polite about my optimism. “Trump does not have to break the law; he will attack the norms,"" she said. “And once those norms are undermined, anything is possible."" Institutions are fragile, she implied; they work only if those in charge adhere to rules followed for generations.  Breaking rules is not difficult. Clever people find ways to do so. The Republican-controlled Senate would not give a hearing to Merrick Garland, whom Obama appointed to the US Supreme Court, saying such nominations can’t be made in the president’s final year, even though there is no such rule. And yet, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would hold hearings for a new Trump appointee (if there is a vacancy in the next two months), even though this is an election year, because the same party controls the Senate and the presidency. Again, there’s neither such a rule, nor a convention. Such sophistry erodes norms.  In fact, the Trump administration has violated not just norms, but also laws. Think of the number of his associates and appointees being indicted or sentenced. The administration has been fatal for many of its citizens. More than thrice as many Americans have died due to coronavirus than the number of US soldiers killed in the Vietnam War. But, like a bull in a china shop, Trump acts audaciously because he knows he can get away with it. There is a Yiddish word, chutzpah, but that doesn’t explain it, because chutzpah has a certain charm—it speaks of street-smart roguishness. Trump’s audacity is raw, that of a dangerous bully.  Whether or not Trump wins, he has transformed the Republican Party. It is no longer the party of the rich American who wanted to pay less taxes and upheld the benign paternalism of noblesse oblige to fix societal ills that the state couldn’t and shouldn’t fix. Trump’s party uses the state’s power to intrude in people’s lives, interferes with markets and the economy, tears up international commitments, and has made it easier for bigots and racists not only to flaunt prejudice, but brandish weapons with impunity and intimidate (sometimes even shoot) those who look or think different.  In early 2017, when I lived in London, my friend Nirmal Ghosh, the Washington correspondent of Singapore’s daily Straits Times, came visiting. He was to speak at a university about how he reported US politics for an overseas audience. An American in the hall asked him if he saw any difference in covering the US after nearly three decades of reporting from Asia. Ghosh had reported from Singapore, the Philippines and India before his last Asian posting, Thailand, where he covered Indo-China. “Not at all,"" Ghosh said. “It is very easy to understand Trump—he operates exactly like some Asian leaders I have covered,"" he added, pointing out the relatives Trump was appointing to key positions and the cronies he was rewarding. Ghosh had covered businessmen-turned-politicians in Thailand, a comical strongman in the Philippines, and seen the collusion of business and politics elsewhere. He spoke of how leaders in Cambodia and Zimbabwe did it, and said Trump would be no different.  That is the ultimate tragedy for American democracy. It was never perfect, for no democracy is. Aspects of it still inspire. The spontaneous support for the Black Lives Matter movement; the lawyers fighting inhumane administration policies that target refugees; the journalists who ask tough questions of the administration; and the judges who uphold the law and not the legitimacy of temporary rulers.

There will be no military parade in Beijing as there was for the 70th anniversary, but Xi is taking the leadership to a ceremony in Beijing that will be broadcast live. Will Wang Qishan be making his first public appearance in months?  There are no signs of a reduction in tensions on the India-China border, and there is a confirmation that one Indian soldier, of Tibetan descent, died in a mine blast. India also banned 188 more Chinese apps in the country. I have to say, the PLA's destruction of the Indian market opportunities for PRC tech firms is an impressive feat.  Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), and David Sacks, a research fellow at the CFR, today called for ending America’s policy of “strategic ambiguity” about whether or not the US would defend Taiwan if the mainland attacked:  Washington’s deliberate ambiguity on the matter helped dissuade China from attempting to “reunify” Taiwan with the mainland, as it could not be sure that the United States would remain on the sidelines. At the same time, the policy discouraged Taiwan from declaring independence—a step that would have precipitated a cross-strait crisis—because its leaders could not be sure of unequivocal U.S. support. The policy known as strategic ambiguity has, however, run its course. Ambiguity is unlikely to deter an increasingly assertive China with growing military capabilities. The time has come for the United States to introduce a policy of strategic clarity: one that makes explicit that the United States would respond to any Chinese use of force against Taiwan. Washington can make this change in a manner that is consistent with its one-China policy and that minimizes the risk to U.S.-Chinese relations. Indeed, such a change should strengthen U.S.-Chinese relations in the long term by improving deterrence and reducing the chances of war in the Taiwan Strait, the likeliest site for a clash between the United States and China.  How might Beijing react if the US ends the policy of strategic ambiguity? Would ending this policy be more palatable to Beijing than a broader upgrading of the US-Taiwan relationship?

The Essential Eight  1. India-China  India acts to secure border after Himalayan clashes with China | The Guardian  According to members of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile, Nyima Tenzin, an Indian soldier of Tibetan descent who is a regiment company leader in the Special Frontier Force (SFF) – an elite army unit that patrols the Himalayan border – died in the clashes along the border on the weekend.    Tenzin’s body was taken to the Tibetan settlement camp near the city of Leh in Ladakh, where his wife and two children live, for final Buddhist rights to be performed.    The death of Tenzin, the first casualty since 20 Indian soldiers lost their lives in June during a high-altitude confrontation in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, has not been confirmed by the Indian government, which rarely comment on SFF operations.  Tibetan soldier's death near tense India-China border sheds light on covert unit - Reuters  The death of a Tibetan member of an Indian special forces unit in a mine blast near the site of a border flare-up with Chinese troops has offered a rare glimpse into a little-known group of elite, high-altitude warriors.  PUBG banned in India's latest salvo against 118 Chinese apps - The Economic Times  The ministry of electronics and IT on Wednesday, issued orders to ban 118 more Chinese apps after banning 59 apps in the first round. The new apps include popular mobile gaming app PUBG, and apps from the stable of Baidu, Tencent and Xiaomi.    ET reported last month that the government has prepared a list of 275 more Chinese apps including PUBG which could be banned on concerns of data security. This comes after fresh tensions on the border between India and China.  Indian move to ban 118 more Chinese apps is to deflect domestic failures: expert - Global Times  The move also comes as India, the most populous country in South Asia, continues to be ravaged by the COVID-19 epidemic that has been crippling the economy, and thus the move is a calculated provocative move by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to hide its domestic failures, said Zhao Gancheng, director of the Center for Asia-Pacific Studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies.    ""India's adventurism and opportunism stands out in particular,"" Zhao told the Global Times on Wednesday, adding that with its economy deteriorating rapidly and the epidemic worsening there, India is facing the risk of a ""collapse,"" which could mean the downfall of Modi's administration.  Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying's Regular Press Conference on September 2, 2020  Reuters: The Indian side said that the ""Tibetan armed unit"" is part and parcel of the Indian armed forces, because they have the best high-altitude combat capabilities. This unit was formed under the guidance of the CIA in the 1960s, which is part of the ""strategic exchange"" between the two sides. The Dalai Lama and the ""Tibetan government-in-exile"" support them in fighting shoulder by shoulder with India. What is China's view on ""Tibetans in exile"" joining the Indian army?    Hua Chunying: I'm not aware of what you said about these ""Tibetans in exile"" in the Indian armed forces. You may ask the Indian side for this.    But I noted some words you mentioned, including ""the 1960s"", ""CIA"" and ""Tibetans in exile"". These words prompt us to ponder over the ins and outs of the Tibet-related issues and the role the US has played in this process. China's position is very clear. We firmly oppose any country providing convenience in any form for the ""Tibet independence"" forces' separatist activities.    I am also wondering what is the connection between so-called ""Tibetans in exile"" and the Indian border troops. I hope you can do some in-depth investigation. It will be great if you can share with us any further information and progress in this regard.  China-India border: defence ministers to converge on Russia amid stand-off tensions in disputed territory | South China Morning PostSouth China Morning Post  Defence ministers from China and India are expected to arrive in Russia on Wednesday as the two countries face each other in a fresh stand-off over their disputed border lands.    China’s Wei Fenghe and his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh, will attend an annual meeting of defence ministers under the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).    Singh and Wei will attend the meetings hosted by Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, although there are apparently no plans for talks between India and China on the sidelines  China Foreign Ministry Says No Indian Troops Died Along Border | Reuters  China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday no Indian troops had died along the countries' shared border, as fresh tensions flared up on the frontier.  Amid LAC row, US calls on China to stop 'bullying neighbours' - Times of India  ""We're hoping for a peaceful resolution to the situation on the China-India border…the Chinese communist party is engaged in a clear & intensifying pattern of bullying its neighbors,” Pompeo said at a state Department briefing, while also expressing concern about Chinese call to ""Sinicize"" Tibetan Buddhism and calling on Beijing to enter dialogue with the Dalai Lama.  India will gain nothing from its border aggression - China Daily  Both the Indian military and government should be aware by now that they will never get an inch of the territory they are not entitled with their encroachment. They should never underestimate the determination of Chinese troops to defend China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.    China has reiterated that both sides should respect the Line of Actual Control and solve their border dispute through talks. China has also made it clear that the border dispute should not have a negative impact on the engagement between the two countries in other areas.    However, it seems that New Delhi thinks otherwise. The border dispute with China and the face-offs and even bloody clashes between the troops of the two sides have turned out to be something that the Indian military and government believe they can make an issue of to stimulate nationalism among Indian people and divert Indian people's attention from its internal problems, such as the country's poor economic performance and soaring novel coronavirus infections.  The Silent Victims of China-India Travel Bans: Cancer Patients - SixthTone  The problem is that Ying buys the drugs from a company in India, which sells a generic version of imatinib at a fraction of the price charged by Chinese suppliers. For thousands of Chinese cancer patients, importing pills from South Asia is the only way to afford potentially life-saving drugs.    Through 2020, however, travel restrictions between China and India have thrown this enormous drug trade into chaos. And the situation shows little sign of improving amid tense relations between the two countries.  Indian troops first to cross LAC; blame for border issues lies with New Delhi - Global Times  Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times that as the military strength of both China and India is clearly known to the world, India, the weak party, uses the description of ""preemptive actions,"" revealing the hubris of some Indian officials.    India must bear the responsibility and consequences if China takes tough countermeasures since it was the first to engage in provocation, Qian said.    India has put its sincerity in maintaining the peace and stability of the China-India border area in doubt, as it keeps stirring up new trouble while leaving old ones unresolved, Qian said.    After the Monday incident, a short video depicting several Indian soldiers singing and dancing with two flags that showed the separatist symbol adopted by the ""Tibetan government in exile"" circulated widely on Twitter.  Chinese embassy urges India to immediately withdraw troops illegally trespassing border area - People's Daily Online  In response to a media query on the China-India border situation, Spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in India Counselor Ji Rong said China has urged the Indian side to restrain its frontline troops and immediately end all provocative actions.    ""On Aug. 31, Indian troops violated the consensus reached in previous multi-level engagements and negotiations between China and India, illegally trespassed the Line of Actual Control again at the southern bank of the Pangong Tso Lake and near the Reqin Pass in the western sector of China-India border, and conducted flagrant provocations, which again stirred tension in the border areas,"" Ji said.  2. 75th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War  Xi to attend commemoration of 75th victory anniversary of anti-Japanese war, WWII - Xinhua  Chinese leaders led by Xi Jinping will attend an event on Thursday morning to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.    They will be joined by representatives from all walks of life in the Chinese capital to present flower baskets to martyrs at a museum of the war in Beijing.    The event will be broadcast live by the China Media Group  铭记历史 砥砺奋进——写在中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利75周年之际-新华网  “Remember the history and strive forward,” Xinhua’s long commentary on the 75th anniversary of the end of WWII. It again said the CCP played the role of “a pillar 中流砥柱” in the war  Commentary: Cherish peace, guard against evil - Xinhua  As the world is to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, the humanity should guard against the return of the evil and darkness from the ashes of history...    The world today faces a particularly worrying situation. Some radical forces nowadays are jeopardizing human solidarity, stirring up hatred and attempting to sow discord among nations.    They have resorted to every possible means to obstruct other countries' development. They have been repeating acts of bullying, advocating economic decoupling and propagating racism and discrimination.    They have also been stoking ideological confrontation and pressuring other countries to join their pursuit of major-country rivalry. These acts threaten to push the world to the brink of turmoil and division.  全民族抗战是中国人民抗日战争胜利的重要法宝 The National War of Resistance was the key to the victory of the Chinese people in the war against Japan（人民要论） - 王建朗 Wang Jianlang - 9.2 People's Daily page 9  The war against Japan not only saved the nation from peril, but also left a valuable spiritual legacy for posterity, which is the great spirit of war resistance forged in the fire: the patriotic sentiment that the rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of all men; the national temperament that sees death as if it were return and refuses to yield; the heroic spirit that defies violence and fights to the bitter end; and the indomitable and persevering belief in victory. The great spirit of resistance will always be a powerful spiritual impetus for the Chinese people to overcome all hardships and obstacles and to strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  (The author is Director of the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and a researcher at the Center for the Study of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences)    抗日战争不仅挽救民族于危亡，还给后人留下了宝贵的精神遗产，这就是战火中铸就的伟大的抗战精神：天下兴亡、匹夫有责的爱国情怀，视死如归、宁死不屈的民族气节，不畏强暴、血战到底的英雄气概，百折不挠、坚忍不拔的必胜信念。伟大的抗战精神，永远是激励中国人民克服一切艰难险阻、为实现中华民族伟大复兴而奋斗的强大精神动力。    （作者为中国社会科学院近代史研究所所长、中国社会科学院习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心研究员）  央视新闻：中俄两国大使共同发文纪念二战胜利75周年  The Chinese ambassador to Russia co-authored an article with the Russian ambassador to China on the Russian newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta to commemorate the end of WWII. They vowed to work together to safeguard the victory of the war, and give more support to multilateralism.  3. Taiwan  MOFA unveils Taiwan’s new passport design - Taiwan Today  Major changes include enlarging the English font for Taiwan and placing it directly above the word “passport” to clearly indicate holders’ national identity. In addition, the country’s official name in English is embedded three times in the outer circle of the national emblem for greater aesthetic appeal.  Taiwan’s opposition KMT to uphold ‘one China’ consensus as part of cross-strait policy | South China Morning PostSouth China Morning Post  Taiwan’s main opposition party the Kuomintang has decided to keep the 1992 consensus on “one China” as part of its cross-strait policy, a move that is certain to please Beijing, which sees the self-ruled island as part of its territory.    The vague agreement was reached by unofficial representatives of Beijing and Taipei in Hong Kong nearly three decades ago – that there is only one China, but each side can have its own interpretation of what constitutes “China”.  Taiwan military’s ‘overreaction’ to report shows it’s ‘guilty’: Beijing think tank - Global Times  The island of Taiwan on Wednesday said a Beijing think tank report on Sunday which claims a US military aircraft may have taken off from a Taiwan-based airfield and flew to Japan was fake news. This is the third time that the Taiwan military authority has responded to the report by the think tank, which recently gained prominence for closely tracking US military activities in the Taiwan Straits.    In an exclusive interview with the Global Times, the head of the think tank stressed that the Taiwan authorities' ""grand treatment"" of the report was an overreaction and only causes suspicion from the outside world.    ""We have not published false information, but have reasonable suspicion based on open source ADS-B and remote sensing data, which can be restored and retraced on the international platform. We welcome the island's response, but hope it can come up with more details and evidence to prove that there is no such thing,"" Hu Bo, director of the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) - the think tank - told the Global Times on Wednesday.  【世界知识】如何看当前中美在西太海上的军事摩擦风险  Hu Bo of Peking University and the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) wrote that the US military has been increasingly aggressive in encounters with the PLA in South China Sea, even though the Americans are not ready for a war. He urged both sides to have more mil-mil dialogue to deescalate the tension and make their intentions more transparent to each other.  Taiwan Needs Unambiguous American Support - Foreign Affairs To Keep the Peace, Make Clear to China That Force Won’t Stand - By Richard Haass and David Sacks  The policy known as strategic ambiguity has, however, run its course. Ambiguity is unlikely to deter an increasingly assertive China with growing military capabilities. The time has come for the United States to introduce a policy of strategic clarity: one that makes explicit that the United States would respond to any Chinese use of force against Taiwan. Washington can make this change in a manner that is consistent with its one-China policy and that minimizes the risk to U.S.-Chinese relations. Indeed, such a change should strengthen U.S.-Chinese relations in the long term by improving deterrence and reducing the chances of war in the Taiwan Strait, the likeliest site for a clash between the United States and China...    One thing, however, has not changed over these four decades: an imposed Chinese takeover of Taiwan remains antithetical to U.S. interests. If the United States fails to respond to such a Chinese use of force, regional U.S. allies, such as Japan and South Korea, will conclude that the United States cannot be relied upon and that it is pulling back from the region. These Asian allies would then either accommodate China, leading to the dissolution of U.S. alliances and the crumbling of the balance of power, or they would seek nuclear weapons in a bid to become strategically self-reliant. Either scenario would greatly increase the chance of war in a region that is central to the world’s economy and home to most of its people.    Meanwhile, the 24 million people of Taiwan would see their democracy and freedoms crushed. China would subsume the island’s vibrant, high-tech economy. And China’s military would no longer be bottled up within the first island chain: its navy would instead have the ability to project Chinese power throughout the western Pacific.  Solomon Islands province announces independence vote amid China tensions | The Guardian  The referendum plan comes after a year of tensions between Suidani’s provincial government, which is supportive of Taiwan, and Solomon Islands’ national government which has adopted a pro-Beijing stance.    The internal division over China policy falls along similar cultural, ethnic and political fault lines that led to civil unrest in Solomon Islands between 1998 and 2003, resulting in a fourteen year Australian-led peacekeeping mission which concluded in 2017.  4. US-China  Advancing Reciprocity in U.S.- China Diplomatic Relations - United States Department of State  The Department of State will now require senior PRC diplomats in the United States to receive approval to visit U.S. university campuses and to meet with local government officials. Cultural events with an audience larger than 50 people hosted by the PRC embassy and consular posts outside of mission properties will also require Department of State approval. The Department of State will also take action to help ensure that all official PRC embassy and consular social media accounts are properly identified as PRC government accounts, since the U.S. Embassy is denied unfettered access to PRC social media and PRC citizens are blocked from using Twitter and Facebook, amongst other social media platforms.    The United States insists on reciprocal access to educational and cultural institutions for U.S. diplomats around the world. These new requirements on PRC diplomats are a direct response to the excessive restraints already placed on our diplomats by the PRC, and they aim to provide further transparency on the practices of the PRC government. Should the PRC eliminate the restrictions imposed on U.S. diplomats, we stand ready to reciprocate.  挑衅升级！美国务院宣称将对中国驻美外交官工作活动实施限制_新浪新闻  Global Times report on the new visa restrictions leaves out the US claim that it is a reciprocal response  Secretary Michael R. Pompeo With Lou Dobbs of Lou Dobbs Tonight - United States Department of State  QUESTION: At last count there were 75 of the so-called Confucius Institutes in K through 12, American colleges and university campuses. How many will there be by the end of this year?    SECRETARY POMPEO: I hope the answer is zero, Lou. We’ve made clear that these are foreign missions. The State Department has designated them as such. That’s important because now they come under a set of restrictions and rules. I think most universities – and frankly, we’ve had these Confucius Institution places other than American colleges. I think that everyone’s coming to see the risk associated with them and the recruitment of spies and collaborators inside of those institutions. I think these institutions can see that and I’m hopeful we will get them all closed out before the end of this year.    QUESTION: And the prospect that Chinese students will just simply be disallowed in the United States because they have been the agents, if you will, of espionage amongst the many agents of espionage in this country working for the CCP.    SECRETARY POMPEO: Lou, I don’t know what decision the President will ultimately make with respect to the broad array of Chinese students, but your point is well taken. They aren’t all spies, but many of them are being watched, their families back home are being watched, and these are efforts for the Chinese Government – the Chinese Communist Party in particular – to identify those that might ultimately work on their behalf.    QUESTION: As the complexity – the depth of the complexity and this challenge and threat from the People’s Republic of China has to be met on so many levels and in so many theaters, including amongst our allies, whether they be in Europe or Southeast Asia. We know that India – Modi has sent a warship into the South China Sea, an act in response – it is at least interpreted as such – against the clashes on the border with China, and also it appears with some affinity with the U.S. Navy that is in the South China Sea. The importance of the relationship with India in meeting the threat from China.    SECRETARY POMPEO: Lou, it’s central that we have friends and allies in this battle. We’ve worked for two years now to build that out. We’ve made real progress. You’ve seen lots of countries turn away from Huawei. You’ve seen them acknowledge the threat. They slept on this threat the same way America did for two decades. I think you’re seeing the entire world begin to unite around the central understanding that the Chinese Communist Party simply is going to refuse to compete in a fair, reciprocal, transparent way, and so whether it’s our friends in India, our friends in Australia, friends in Japan or South Korea, I think they have all come to see the risk to their own people, to their own countries, and you’ll see them partner with the United States to push back on every front that we’ve talked about this evening.  Chinese MND: US report on China full of Cold War mentality - China Military  In response to press question on Wednesday, the information bureau of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense (MND) said the U.S. report is full of the zero-sum Cold War mentality.    The report exaggerates the so-called “Chinese military threat”, distorts China's defense policy and military strategy, smears China’s military modernization development, defense expenditure and nuclear policy, and provokes cross-strait confrontation and intensifies tensions across the Taiwan Strait, which are extremely wrong, said the bureau.  国防部新闻局回应美发布《中国军事与安全态势发展报告》 - 中华人民共和国国防部  国防部新闻局9月2日应询表示：美方《中国军事与安全态势发展报告》充满零和博弈的冷战思维，渲染所谓“中国军事威胁”，曲解中国国防政策和军事战略，抹黑中国军队现代化建设、国防开支、核政策等问题，挑动两岸对立、加剧台海形势紧张，这是极其错误的，中方对此表示坚决反对。我们将视情作出进一步回应。  Pentagon report intends to weaken China’s nuclear deterrence: Global Times editorial - Global Times  We believe the number of ""low 200s"" is smaller than in people's perception, and this is an intentional underestimation. At the same time, the report said China will at least double the number of nuclear warheads over the next decade, which sends a deliberate message to the US and world that China is accelerating the expansion of its nuclear arsenal.    The Pentagon has two purposes. One is to weaken China's nuclear deterrence, especially the role of China's nuclear capability in shaping American society's attitude toward China. The US is launching a strong strategic suppression against China, causing tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Straits. The US military hopes to downplay the anxieties this has caused to American society, stressing that the US has an overwhelming strategic advantage over China. So no matter how the US military provokes China, Americans don't have to worry.    The second goal is to condition the international community's basic understanding of China's nuclear strength on low 200s, so that it can use the figure as the base to pressure China's nuclear disarmament with the US and Russia, and squeeze China's ability to strengthen its nuclear power.  TikTok Deal Talks Are Snarled Over Fate of App’s Algorithms - WSJ $$  One of the people familiar with Beijing’s thinking said the goal of the new restrictions is to delay the deal to allow the Chinese government to have a say as well as to subject it to a level of Chinese government scrutiny similar to that imposed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. The panel within the U.S. Treasury Department has forced the unwinding of several Chinese acquisitions on national-security grounds and has scrutinized TikTok.  Exclusive: Aspiring TikTok buyers pursue four options in effort to revive talks - sources - Reuters  The fourth scenario involves ByteDance licensing the algorithm to the buyer of the TikTok assets, the sources said. However, this could worry CFIUS, which wants ByteDance to forego any relationship it has with TikTok in the United States.  Trump and COVID force Chinese students to rethink the US - Nikkei Asian Review  A generation that buoyed the country's $170bn university sector is leaving  中外专家呼吁超越意识形态差异 共建人类命运共同体 Chinese and foreign experts call for transcending ideological differences to build a community with a shared future for mankind-中新网  The ""Belt and Road"" Think Tank Cooperation Alliance, initiated by the International Liaison Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held an international high-end think tank cloud forum on August 31, with the theme of ""Beyond ideological differences and build a community with a shared future for mankind""    由中共中央对外联络部发起成立的“一带一路”智库合作联盟8月31日举办国际高端智库云端论坛，论坛以“超越意识形态差异，共建人类命运共同体”为主题。...    Song Tao said that maintaining the stability of China-US relations is not only related to the interests of the two peoples, but also to the overall situation of world peace and development. Some current U.S. politicians are taking advantage of the epidemic to stigmatize, generalize national security, politicize economic and trade cooperation, and draw ideological lines in an attempt to put together an exclusive group, which goes against the trend of historical development and runs counter to the interests of the Chinese and U.S. peoples and the peoples of the world. China is committed to promoting Sino-American relations based on coordination, cooperation and stability, and is ready to work with other countries to safeguard the international system with the United Nations at its core and an international order based on international law, and to contribute its wisdom and strength to the promotion of world peace and development and the building of a community of human destiny.    宋涛表示，维护中美关系稳定不仅事关中美两国人民利益，也关乎世界和平发展大局。当前美一些政客借疫情搞污名化，把国家安全泛化、把经贸合作政治化，并以意识形态划线，企图拼凑排他性集团，是逆历史发展潮流而动，与中美两国人民和世界各国人民的利益背道而驰。中方致力于推动以协调、合作、稳定为基调的中美关系，愿同世界各国一道，维护以联合国为核心的国际体系和以国际法为基础的国际秩序，为促进世界和平发展、构建人类命运共同体贡献智慧和力量。  5. “United in the war on the epidemic”  The new, six part official documentary on the fight against covid-19, produced by the Central Propaganda Department and China Media Group hot the airwaves today.  《同心战“疫”》 第一集 令出如山 - CCTV  六集大型纪录片《同心战“疫”》即将开播--时政--人民网  《同心战“疫”》共分六集，分别为《令出如山》《生死阻击》《坚强防线》《众志成城》《命运与共》《人民至上》。  钟南山：我们跟有些国家很大的区别就是命最重要！  Zhong Nanshan took a jab at the United States for its handling of COV19, in a public speech to the Chinese teenagers on CCTV. “One thing that distinguishes us from some other countries is that life is the most important [to us]! One’s life is the most treasured thing. One’s right to live is the most important human right!” he said.  6. Protests against changes to Mongolian language teaching  Curbs on Mongolian Language Teaching Prompt Large Protests in China - The New York Times  Images of the protests shared on social media sites showed crowds of parents and students amassing peacefully outside schools, singing and shouting slogans as the authorities looked on. In one video, a woman was shown flipping through the pages of a textbook, decrying the absence of Mongolian language. In another, students in blue and white uniforms shouted, “Mongolian is our mother language! We are Mongolian until death!” Photographs of petitions filled with signatures and studded with red fingerprints also ricocheted around the internet.  Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center  Mongolian parents from different places reported via video clips that campuses and classrooms were empty thanks to the well-planned total school strike organized by Mongolians against the Chinese Central Government’s plan to replace Mongolian with Chinese as the only language of instruction in the region.  Students in Inner Mongolia protest Chinese language policy - AP  The policy, announced on Monday ahead of the start of the new school year, requires schools to use new national textbooks in Chinese, replacing Mongolian-language textbooks. Protesters say they were aware of demonstrations and classroom walkouts in Hohhot, the provincial capital, as well as in the cities of Chifeng and Tongliao and Xilin Gol prefecture...    Now the Mongolian-medium schools sit quiet in Tongliao. Local Communist Party leaders have been visiting each family to try to get the students to return, Zhang said.    Authorities have banned a popular Mongolian-language social media platform called Bainu.  赵克志在内蒙古和宁夏调研时强调 深入学习贯彻习近平总书记重要训词精神 坚决做到绝对忠诚绝对纯洁绝对可靠--法治--人民网  Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi has been on an inspection tour in Ningxia and Inner Mongolia    Zhao Kezhi inspected all levels of public security organs and grass-roots teams in Hulunbuir, Hohhot and Yinchuan, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia. He demanded that we should keep in mind the fundamental political attribute of public security surnamed the Party, unswervingly adhere to the Party's absolute leadership of public security work, always take the Party's banner as the banner, the Party's direction as the direction, and the Party's will as the will, and ensure that we resolutely listen to the Party and follow the Party at all times and under all circumstances.

It isn't going well. - The Washington Post  “Beijing sees Europe as the biggest prize to be secured in current stage of U.S.-China rivalry,” said Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin. “But Beijing squandered it.”    After he met Wang this past week, French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a speech calling on Europe to bolster homegrown 5G technology — a field led by Chinese firm Huawei. On Wednesday, German officials unveiled an “Indo-Pacific” strategy that would reduce reliance on China.    “Wang Yi’s visit didn’t achieve minimum goals,” Benner said. “He didn’t have anything substantial to offer that Europeans care about, like concessions on market access, and just reiterated tired and worn boilerplate cliches on Europe and China working together on multilateralism that hardly anyone falls for anymore.  Chinese FM calls for consultation, coordination, cooperation between China, Germany - Xinhua  According to Wang Yi, the three tasks that China and Germany should take on are: Strengthening global anti-epidemic cooperation and revive the world economy; Advancing the China-EU relations to a higher level; Advocating for multilateralism and oppose the ""new cold war""  How China Made the Netherlands Question Its Free-Market Beliefs - Bloomberg  Now it’s crafting a foreign investment screening mechanism and has all-but ruled out the participation of Huawei in its 5G network core by barring companies that “are obligated to work with governmental organizations, especially those in charge of intelligence.”    The Netherlands is one just two European Union members -- Sweden is the other -- to have a public strategy on China. In it, the government cites assessments by the AIVD Dutch intelligence agency noting Chinese intelligence gathering on financial, economic and political subjects, as well as Beijing’s interest in Dutch companies active in the fields of high-tech systems, energy, maritime technology and life sciences and health.  “Germany – Europe – Asia: shaping the 21st century together”: The German Government adopts policy guidelines on the Indo-Pacific region - Federal Foreign Office  Our prosperity and our geopolitical influence in the coming decades will depend on how we work together with the countries of the Indo-Pacific region.

We want to help shape that order – so that it is based on rules and international cooperation, not on the law of the strong.  8. Another plagiarism scandal  Accusations of Mass Math Plagiarism Deal Another Blow to Chinese Academia’s Dented Reputation - Caixin  A total of 24 papers have since been removed from journals including the International Journal of Mathematics, published by Singapore’s World Scientific, and Boundary Value Problems, which is published by U.S.-based Springer.    Caixin also found that at least 20 more of the papers cited in the journalists’ report had been removed prior to its publication.    The journalists claim that almost half of the Chinese clients came from the less-prestigious Henan University of Economics and Law (HUEL), based in Henan province’s capital Zhengzhou. But the mill’s services were also allegedly used by senior academics at some of China’s top universities, including Harbin Engineering University and Henan University. Many of the academics accused of involvement in the scandal are not mathematics specialists...    The plagiarism saga can be traced back to a paper published in 2012 in the U.S.-based journal Abstract and Applied Analysis, published by London-based Hindawi Publishing. The authors, including Qiao Lei at HUEL, were all based in Zhengzhou.    Two years later, the paper, with its name unchanged and content slightly tweaked, was re-published by two other Zhengzhou-based researchers in the Springer-published Indian journal Proceedings - Mathematical Sciences, without any credit to Qiao’s paper. The article, which has yet to be removed from the journal, is almost identical to Qiao’s, repeating formulas, calculations, explanations and conclusions, with a few changes to phrasing.

The coronavirus pandemic will widen the poverty gap between women and men, pushing 47 million more women and girls into impoverished lives by next year and undoing progress made in recent decades, the United Nations said on Wednesday.  More women than men worldwide will be made poor by the economic fallout and massive job losses caused by COVID-19, with informal workers worst hit in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, according to new UN estimates.  ""The increases in women's extreme poverty ... are a stark indictment of deep flaws in the ways we have constructed our societies and economies,"" Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the head of UN Women, said in a statement.  Samantha Murozoki, right, hands a free meal to a woman from her home in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe, in May. With the help of volunteers, Murozoki served over 100 hot meals per day to families whose household income had been cut off during the government-imposed COVID-19 lockdown. (Jekesai Njikizana/AFP/Getty Images)  During the pandemic, women have lost their jobs at a faster rate than men have, as they are more likely to be employed in the sectors hardest hit by long lockdowns such as retail, restaurants and hotels, the statement said.  Women are also more likely to work in the informal economy, typically in jobs as domestic workers and cleaners that often come with little or no health care, unemployment benefits or other protections.  ""We know that women take most of the responsibility for caring for the family; they earn less, save less and hold much less secure jobs,"" Mlambo-Ngcuka said.  According to the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO), about 70 per cent of domestic workers globally had lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19 by June this year.  Overall, the pandemic will push an additional 96 million people into extreme poverty by next year, nearly half of whom are women and girls, according to estimates by UN Women and the UN's Development Programme (UNDP).  This will bring the total number of women and girls worldwide living in extreme poverty to 435 million — defined as a person living on $1.90 US a day or less — and it is expected that this figure will not revert to pre-pandemic levels until 2030.

Governments could adopt measures to help women in low-paid and informal jobs, said Achim Steiner, a UNDP administrator.  ""More than 100 million women and girls could be lifted out of poverty if governments implement a comprehensive strategy aimed at improving access to education and family planning, fair and equal wages, and expanding social transfers,"" Steiner said.  What's happening with coronavirus in Canada  As of 7 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Canada had 129,923 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases. Provinces and territories listed 115,050 of those as recovered or resolved. A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial reports, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 9,173.  A new study reveals that COVID-19 is disproportionately impacting the health and finances of Black Canadians.  Black Canadians are more likely than other Canadians to seek treatment and experience layoffs due to the coronavirus. They're also more likely to report feeling at risk on their commute to work, a new study reveals.  The study, carried out by the Edmonton-based African Canadian Civic Engagement Council and Innovative Research Group, looks at the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 from the perspectives of Black Canadians and those in the broader Canadian population. Its authors say it appears to be the first of its kind.  Dunia Nur, president of the African Canadian Civic Engagement Council, said the research tells a largely untold story about the lived experiences of Black Canadians around COVID-19.  The study's findings show Black Canadians are more likely than other Canadians to be infected or hospitalized by the disease and nearly three times more likely to know someone who has died after contracting COVID-19.  Black communities are experiencing layoffs, reduced work hours and a reduction in household incomes at higher rates, with men over 45 being hardest hit, the research found.  Fifty-six per cent of Black respondents said their job, or the job of someone they knew, had been affected, compared with the national average of 46 per cent.  Among commuters, Black Canadians are twice as likely than the national average to feel their commute to work is unsafe, with Black commuters more likely to experience symptoms or seek medical treatment.  ""The more we know about the impacts of COVID-19 in various communities, and perhaps the reasons why there's a disproportionate impact on these communities, [it] will help governments and help organizations like ACCEC develop policies and programs that are going to help alleviate the disproportionate impact,"" said Jason Lockhart, Innovative's vice-president and a principal researcher on the project.  The survey was conducted online among a representative sample of 2,322 Canadians, including a representative sample of 400 Black Canadians, from June 17 through June 30.  Meanwhile, Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, is urging Canadians to consider wearing a mask when having sex with a new partner to protect themselves from catching the coronavirus.  Tam added that going solo remains the lowest-risk sexual option in a pandemic.  Although there is little chance of catching COVID-19 from semen or vaginal fluid, sexual activity with someone new does increase the risk of contracting the virus, particularly if there is close contact like kissing.  Sexual health is an important part of overall health, Tam said, and by taking precautions, ""Canadians can find ways to enjoy physical intimacy while safeguarding the progress we have all made containing COVID-19.""  Wear a mask that covers your mouth and nose, and monitor yourself and your partner for symptoms ahead of any sexual activity with someone outside of your household or close-contacts bubble, Dr. Theresa Tam said Wednesday.

Further reports indicate that the bar's customers flouted isolation orders while waiting for their test results.  Public health officials in Quebec City said Wednesday they have traced 10 secondary cases of COVID-19 back to Bar Kirouac on top of the original 40 linked to a karaoke night there on Aug. 23.

In Germany, prosecutors said Wednesday that anti-lockdown protesters and face-mask refusers can be called ""Covidiots,"" dismissing legal complaints against Social Democrat co-leader Saskia Esken who used the term on Twitter.

The death is the first reported from the biker rally that drew hundreds of thousands of people. Infections linked to the event have been reported among people in states spanning coast to coast. The rally went ahead despite fears it could become a super-spread event.

Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, was 77 and had been serving a life prison term for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  He died at a hospital in Cambodia early Wednesday morning, said Neak Pheaktra, a spokesperson for the tribunal in Phnom Penh that handled the trials over the regime's crimes.  Duch was admitted to Cambodian Soviet Friendship Hospital after developing difficulty breathing Monday at the Kandal provincial prison, said Chat Sineang, chief of the prison where Duch had been transferred from the tribunal's prison facility in 2013. He added that the body would be examined for a cause of death before being handed to his family.  CAMBODIA REQUIRING ALL TOURISTS TO PAY $3,000 DEPOSIT TO COVER CORONAVIRUS TESTING, ANY POSSIBLE MEDICAL COSTS  Duch, whose trial took place in 2009, was the first senior Khmer Rouge figure to face the U.N.-backed tribunal that had been assembled to deliver justice for the regime’s brutal rule in the late 1970s, which is blamed for the deaths of 1.7 million people — a quarter of Cambodia’s population at the time.  The commander of the top-secret Tuol Sleng prison code-named S-21 was one of the few ex-Khmer Rouge who acknowledged even partial responsibility for his actions, and his trial included his own wrenchingly graphic testimony of how people were tortured at the prison.  Men, women and children seen as enemies of the regime or who disobeyed its orders were jailed and tormented there, and only a handful survived.  “Everyone who was arrested and sent to S-21 was presumed dead already,” he testified in April 2009.  Torturers under Duch beat and whipped prisoners and shocked them with electrical devices, Duch admitted to the court, but still he denied accounts from survivors and other trial witnesses that he took part in torture and executions himself. The offspring of detainees were killed to ensure the next generation could not take vengeance. Duch called himself “criminally responsible” for babies’ deaths but blamed his subordinates for battering the young bodies against trees.  He said the prison’s own guards and interrogators were killed for small mistakes and showed rare emotion on the witness stand in June 2009 while speaking of seeing his fellow revolutionaries locked in the cells of his prison. Confessing to betraying his own friends, he said: “That was beyond cowardly.”  When a guilty verdict was finally delivered against him in July 2010, he was sentenced to 35 years, shortened to just 19 due to time served. The judges said they considered the Cold War context of the atrocities and Duch’s cooperation and expressions of remorse, however limited. But outraged survivors feared he could one day walk free. On appeal, the sentence was lengthened in 2012 to life in prison for his “shocking and heinous” crimes against the Cambodian people.  Like many key members of the Khmer Rouge, Duch was an academic before he became a revolutionary. The former math teacher joined Pol Pot’s movement in 1967, three years before the U.S. started carpet-bombing Cambodia to try to wipe out Northern Vietnamese troops and Viet Cong inside the border.  The Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 and immediately attempted a radical transformation of Cambodia into a peasant society, emptying cities and forcing the population to work on the land. They backed up their rule with ruthless elimination of perceived enemies, and by 1976, Duch was the trusted head of its ultimate killing machine, S-21.  Tribunal judges said he signed off on all executions there and was often present when interrogators used torture to extract confessions, including pulling out prisoners’ toenails, administering electric shocks, and waterboarding. Despite his denials, the judges said he had at times taken part in the torture and executions himself.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The torture and executions that took place at Tuol Sleng were routinely recorded and photographed, and when the Khmer Rouge were forced from power in 1979, the thousands of documents and film negatives left at the prison became proof of the regime’s atrocities.  Duch fled, disappearing for almost two decades in northwestern Cambodia and converting to Christianity until a chance discovery by a British journalist in 1999 led to his arrest.  Duch has several times asked for forgiveness, even offering at one point to face a public stoning. But his surprise request on the final day of the trial to be acquitted and freed left many wondering if his contrition was sincere.  Harmer reported from Bangkok."

The move to dissolve the CNRP marked the beginning of a wider crackdown by Prime Minister Hun Sen on the political opposition, NGOs, and the independent media that paved the way for his ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats in parliament in the country’s July 2018 general election.    Kem Sokha was released from pre-trial detention to house arrest in September 2018 and granted bail in November last year by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court, and he is now allowed to travel within Cambodia but is restricted from taking part in political activities.    His trial began on Jan. 15 but has been postponed while the country grapples with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.    Kem Sokha maintains his innocence, and his lawyers have said all along that prosecutors lack evidence to convict him at trial.    Attempts to reach Kem Sokha’s lawyers and Ministry of Justice spokesperson Chhin Malin were unsuccessful Wednesday, but CPP spokesperson Sok Ey San told RFA that Kem Sokha will not be allowed to return to political work while he still awaits trial.    “When the court charged him, he lost his political rights,” Sok Ey San said, adding that 118 other CNRP activists and former lawmakers have now also been banned from politics since their party was dissolved.    As a politician, Kem Sokha needs to show he is still active in order to draw support from his followers, and his Facebook message was likely intended to pressure the court to speed up his trial, Cambodia-based political analyst Em Sovannara told RFA on Wednesday.    “But he won’t be able to convince the court or the government to drop the charges against him, because the ruling party is still working to weaken the opposition party,” Em Sovannara said. “It’s only the international community that might have some influence over the government.”    In July, the presiding judge in Kem Sokha’s trial warned him to adhere to the court order banning him from political activities after the 67-year-old opposition leader quietly began a tour of the country’s provinces—visits that one of his lawyers characterized as “sightseeing.”    Reported by RFA’s Khmer Service.

As temperatures and populations continue to rise in many parts of the world, water scarcity is becoming an increasing threat to human security. Among the chief obstacles constraining global efforts to manage freshwater resources sustainably and peacefully is the weak and fragmentary nature of existing arrangements governing shared international watercourses. Although the current web of bilateral and regional water-sharing agreements addresses some water-related tensions, it fails to universally ensure the human right to water and promote sustainable water use.  The challenge of effective transboundary water management is not a new one , but it has become more daunting. Recent events in Ethiopia, China, and the Middle East highlight how bilateral and regional geopolitical dynamics are straining the current system of global watercourse governance and jeopardizing safe and secure access to water.  Weaknesses of Bilateral and Regional Water Agreements  The current framework of watercourse governance relies on the willingness of riparian—or watercourse-sharing—states to negotiate directly with one another without basic universal standards. Water’s status as an essential resource often complicates cooperation and compromise, particularly when would-be negotiating parties are not on the best of terms. Such dynamics are currently at play in the Nile and Brahmaputra river basins.  In late July, Ethiopia began filling the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)—the largest dam in Africa. The water used to fill the reservoir travels from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands to Egypt via the Blue Nile and Nile rivers. Egypt, which relies on this water to meet over ninety percent of its freshwater needs, sees the GERD as a national security threat and has consistently called for Ethiopia to stop the project. Egypt and Sudan, through which this water also passes, contend that the dam violates the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement. That accord allocates all of the Nile’s water to Egypt and Sudan, which are the only riparian states party to the agreement, and grants Egypt sole veto power over development projects on the river. Unsurprisingly, Ethiopia—as well as other upstream states in the Nile Basin like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda—reject the agreement. With tensions riding high as Ethiopia continues to fill the GERD, thereby restricting the amount of water flowing into Egypt, the execution of a regional agreement governing the Nile seems highly unlikely.  While academic studies have shown that transboundary water treaties can mitigate freshwater-related conflict, good bilateral and regional relations also allow for effective water management in the absence of such a treaty. Unfortunately, relations among upstream and downstream nations are often fraught. A case in point is the deteriorating relationship between China and India. The two countries do not have an agreement governing the waters of the Brahmaputra or the Indus rivers, which both originate in Chinese-controlled Tibet. China’s upper riparian status affords it the power to alter and restrict water flowing from its territory into India. Earlier this year, China exerted that leverage by diverting the flow of the Galwan River—a tributary of the Indus—in response to border clashes with its neighbor. Such moves by Beijing to restrict India’s access to freshwater resources could exacerbate an already tense situation. Given that China sees water as a critical resource in achieving its national, regional, and global ambitions, near-term prospects for hashing out an agreement with India that might constrain Chinese access to shared water resources appear remote.  China’s involvement in Southeast Asia likewise underscores the challenge of getting parties to agree upon terms for shared watercourse access and use. The Mekong River Commission (MRC) governs water relations among four riparian states : Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. China, despite being the source of the Mekong, is conspicuously absent from the MRC, participating only as a Dialogue Partner. Showing complete disregard for the responsibilities of upper riparian states under the United Nations Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (UNWC), China has built eleven mega-dams along the Mekong—and plans to build more. These dams have had disastrous environmental consequences and have contributed directly to severe droughts and food shortages in lower riparian states. The dams and their effects have also inhibited downstream coronavirus mitigation efforts.  China regularly leverages its upper riparian status in its relations with Southeast Asian nations. The United States has recently tried to counter Chinese pressure on downstream countries in the Mekong basin, but it is difficult to outbid China when Beijing can use something as fundamental to life as water as a bargaining chip. China’s leverage as an unrestrained upper riparian state enhances its geopolitical clout and reduces the likelihood of a comprehensive multilateral agreement for managing the waters of the Mekong.  Water insecurity is even more dire for non-sovereign entities around the world that have no recourse under bilateral or regional treaties and only weak protections for water rights. The plight of Palestine is stark in this regard. Prior to the deal recently negotiated between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Palestinians living in the West Bank faced a tremendous peril in light of Israeli plans to annex territory in Area C. Israel’s move would have effectively cut Palestinians off from the Jordan River, severely compromising Palestinian water and food security. Although that annexation is now on hold, there is no guarantee that this situation will last. Should annexation proceed, nothing in the current decentralized system of international watercourse governance would prevent Palestinians from losing nearly all access to the region’s main freshwater source. Elsewhere in the region, critics have also accused Turkey of weaponizing water against the Kurds—another stateless nation in the Middle East—in the Syrian civil war.  The Limited Potential of International Agreements  In theory, international conventions and treaties could help address water use and access issues where bilateral and regional legal institutions fall short. The UNWC, for instance, covers both surface and groundwater water resources and reaffirms the basic international water law principle of “no significant harm.” If universally accepted, this principle could protect the interests of downstream states that would be harmed by certain upstream activities—such as excessive damming.  Unfortunately, the UNWC enjoys neither wide-spread adoption nor strong, enforceable language. It has only thirty-six contracting states, and its weak language regarding environmental protections and conflict resolution renders it a thin reed for international watercourse governance. Any effort to strengthen the treaty, much less win universal acceptance for it, faces strong nationalist and geopolitical headwinds in the near to medium term. Growing anxieties about water scarcity could, in the meantime, dissuade many states from entering any negotiations that would potentially limit their access to water—or even embolden unilateral action to acquire these resources.  Forging Forward  In order for international legal institutions to provide a framework for effective global watercourse governance, countries need first and foremost to articulate and abide by universal norms and standards regarding sustainable and equitable water resource use. Although a number of challenges stand in the way, the situation is not hopeless. Historically, global crises often lead to new, creative thinking about international cooperation. The current pandemic is a case in point. While the multilateral response to this global health emergency has been haphazard at best, it has also stimulated international deliberations on multilateral priorities in a post-COVID-19 world. Rising global water insecurity could stimulate similar dynamics. The history of the past century also offers grounds for hope: While the challenge of managing shared water resources is real, and has led to diplomatic frictions, it has been far more likely to result in peaceful resolution and cooperation than violent conflict among nations.  The deepening global climate emergency may also advance cooperation on water issues. Rising global temperatures and changing weather patterns are exacerbating water insecurity in many nations, rich and poor. Water scarcity is not a threat limited to one country or region. This environmental reality creates incentives for nations to cooperate in reaffirming the human right to water, identifying basic universal principles for responsible water use and access, and fixing the holes in the current system of global watercourse governance that hinder sustainable transboundary water management. Until greater cooperation within a renewed multilateral platform becomes plausible, parties afflicted by the shortcomings of the current system of watercourse governance should utilize non-water related tools—such as human rights law, which is a more established sphere of international law—to safeguard water resource interests."

The painful and protracted interruptions to girls’ education are a global emergency, with incalculable potential losses to follow. (Girls Up Initiative Uganda)  It’s back-to-school time in a pandemic, and in much of the world, educators, parents and children anxiously await news of what’s next:  Has the coronavirus been sufficiently controlled so students and teachers can go back to school safely, freeing parents to go back to work? Can citizens trust the data and guidance their public officials are putting out?  And whose data and policy decisions are these, anyway? Those of scientists and public health experts, or populist politicians with their own interests in mind?  Here in the United States, chaos reigns. With COVID-19 surging and rates of infection ricocheting across the country, 73 of the nation’s 100 largest school systems have opted for distance learning this fall. But the president and other leaders are pressing hard for schools to open, leaving school principals agonized over how to secure enough protective equipment and improve the ventilation, cleaning protocols, classroom spacing, and school transport, and how to pay for all those things.  Many wealthy Americans, meanwhile, have left big cities and coronavirus hotspots to reside full-time at their vacation hideaways or new homes in quieter, pricier residential communities—where their children can safely meet, learn, and play, outside and well-protected, at properly equipped suburban schools or under the tutelage of private instructors.  Since the virus struck the developing world, countless families in Latin America, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have abandoned their homes and livelihoods in crowded, costly cities for their ancestral rural villages—a common practice in times of domestic or political strife or an economic or public health emergency, when the cities might feel unsafe or when funds run dry.  In both contexts, this out-migration would seem to be slowing the rapid fire worldwide urbanization that, by mid-2008, made the global population more urban than not. The differences, though, in the prospects for their children—especially for girls—between these similarly de-urbanizing trends could not be more stark.  The suburban schooling or private tutoring for American girls and boys whose families have left the city is likely to be quite good, the children’s college and eventual job prospects unaffected by their move.  In rural Mali, Malawi, Cambodia, Afghanistan, though, or the dozen other countries where WomenStrong International members work with young people, the quality of education, the quality of and access to broadband, TV, or radio, to accommodate remote learning during the pandemic, access to sexual and reproductive health services, and the range of potential livelihoods and incomes toward which a student might strive are all tragically diminished, deepening structural inequality and entrenching poverty for at least another generation.  For girls, the stakes are even higher.  In Kampala, Uganda, where increased fatalities from COVID-19 recently delayed back-to-school plans, many parents unable to provide for their families due to the shutdown have moved their daughters out to their home villages in the countryside, where life can be rugged and tough, reports program officer Abel Moses Mwesigwa, of WomenStrong member Girl Up Initiative Uganda.  “The chances of their returning to school are minimal, while the chances of marrying them off are high,” Mwesigwa said.  Families are fleeing cities to head back to suburbs and rural areas to flee COVID. The migration is pulling millions of girls out of school—and if past experiences with Ebola and civil conflict are a guide, these girls will be permanently locked out of education. (Girls Up Initiative Uganda)  Pre-pandemic, UNESCO had estimated that more than 98 million adolescent girls were out of school.

The Malala Fund projects that protracted school shutdowns due to COVID-19 will augment that number by an additional 20 million girls—leaving them at risk of violence and abuse, teen pregnancy and early marriage, a lost year (or more) of academic, social, and emotional learning, and diminished educational achievement, physical and mental health outcomes, and earning power over a lifetime.  The World Bank has determined that universal secondary education can effectively eliminate child marriage and reduce the risks of becoming a teen mom and of intimate partner violence, under-5 mortality, and child malnutrition.  Secondary education can also increase women’s earning power, their ability to make decisions about their own healthcare and household finances, and their social capital, as measured by their capacity for both altruism and friendships they can count on.  These gains, compounded by the Bank’s estimate that secondary education for girls could reduce both the total fertility rate and global population, suggest that achieving this single goal has the power to transform our very future and that of the planet.  Back in March, UNESCO acted swiftly to forge a Global Education Coalition that mobilized lead UN agencies, development banks, the private sector, labor movement, and others to muster their collective wisdom, resources, and innovative solutions to help salvage the schoolyear, ensure equity in continued access to learning, and ease students’ return to school, when that can occur safely.  The painful and protracted interruptions to girls’ education are a global emergency, with incalculable potential losses to follow, should this and other such endeavors fail.  It will take all hands on deck, including everything our leaders and each of us can do, to keep the hard-won progress over recent decades from unraveling; 120 million girls’ lives, dreams, their families’ future, and their human rights depend on it.  The coronavirus pandemic and the response by federal, state and local authorities is fast-moving. During this time, Ms. is keeping a focus on aspects of the crisis—especially as it impacts women and their families—often not reported by mainstream media.

For the first time, India and Bangladesh were in the “extreme risk” category, joining China and Myanmar in a group of 32 countries with the worst risk of slave labour, the Modern Slavery index by risk analytics company Verisk Maplecroft found.  The risks faced by workers in Cambodia and Vietnam also rose to their highest in four years, taking 32nd and 35th places in the ranking of 198 countries which identified North Korea, Yemen and Syria as the three worst nations for slave labour.  “What makes the situation even more alarming is that modern slavery risks are set to intensify as countries grapple with the economic fallout of the pandemic,” said Sofia Nazalya, a human rights Analyst at Verisk Maplecroft.  “As more workers are pushed into the informal sector, they will be at greater risk of facing more exploitative forms of work, some of which could amount to forced labour conditions,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments.  Asian garment workers supplying global fashion brands lost up to $5.8 billion in wages from March to May, the Clean Clothes Campaign pressure group said last month, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to store closures and cancelled orders.  About 60 million people work in Asia’s garment industry and falling sales have put many jobs at risk. Laid-off workers are likely to turn to exploitative jobs or may put their children to work to cope with the loss of earnings, industry experts say.  “Even in the same jobs, the conditions have become more exploitative,” said Apoorva Kaiwar, Regional Secretary for South Asia at IndustriALL Global Union, a federation that represents workers in 140 countries.  “Our affiliates have reported wage cuts in existing jobs as well as removal of facilities such as transport and canteen with subsidised food. For those who have lost jobs, they are unable to find jobs with comparable wages and benefits.”  Travel restrictions and measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have made it harder for companies to carry out audits to ensure ethical working practices in their supply chains, said the slavery index, which aims to help businesses identify risk.  “The reputational risk to brands from association with modern slavery is ... now higher than at any other time over recent years,” said Nazalya."

New Zealand's current restrictions will be in place at least until the middle of the month, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern unwilling to ease restrictions until authorities can be sure they are working.  Meanwhile, the UK is investing in a coronavirus test that gives results in as little as 20 minutes.  This story will be regularly updated throughout Friday.  Friday's key moments:  India coronavirus infections near 4 million  India has reported a daily jump of 83,341 coronavirus infections, taking its tally to 3.94 million, as it closes in on Brazil as the world's second-most affected nation from the virus.  Asia's worst-hit country is now just around 60,000 cases behind Brazil, which has up to 4 million confirmed cases. The United States still remains the worst affected nation, with more than 6 million cases.  India has logged the world's largest daily caseload every day for almost a month as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Government pushes to open up the economy to prevent further damage from the pandemic.  However, deaths in India from COVID-19 have remained relatively low. The ministry said on Friday 1,096 people died from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, taking the toll to 68,472.  Too early to ease restrictions, New Zealand PM says  Jacinda Ardern said the current restrictions will be reviewed on September 14. ( AP: Nick Perry )  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the country's current restrictions will be around until at least mid-September.  Auckland will remain on alert level 2.5, while the rest of the country will be on alert level 2.0, Ms Ardern told reporters.  She said the settings would be reviewed on September 14 because the new settings had only been in place for five days, so it was too early to know how well they were working.  Ms Ardern said there were still questions about how certain clusters started and spread.  ""We have not been able to determine the person linked to our cluster. That means there could be other people we are missing,"" she said.  ""That has happened to us before and it doesn't mean we can't contain the outbreak around them successfully, but it does give us reason to be careful and it does give us reason to be cautious.""  UNICEF says there will be unprecedented vaccine quantities for COVID-19  Unprecedented quantities of vaccines could be produced by 28 manufacturers in 10 countries over the next two years to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF said as it announced it would help lead efforts to procure and distribute them.  UNICEF's role is part of a COVID-19 vaccine allocation plan — known as COVAX and co-led by the World Health Organization — that aims to buy and provide equitable access to the shots. So far, 76 wealthy nations have committed to joining the COVAX effort.  UNICEF said the 28 vaccine manufacturers had shared their annual productions plans for COVID-19 vaccines through 2023. A UNICEF market assessment revealed that ""manufacturers are willing to collectively produce unprecedented quantities of vaccines over the coming 1-2 years"".  But drugmakers have signalled the projections are ""highly dependent on, among other things, whether clinical trials are successful, advance purchase agreements are put in place, funding is confirmed, and regulatory and registration pathways are streamlined"".  Safe and effective vaccines are seen as essential to ending a pandemic that has so far claimed more than 864,000 lives globally.  UNICEF's new role with COVAX stems from its status as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world. The UN agency said it procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries.

UK to invest in 20-minute COVID-19 test  Getting results for some coronavirus tests may take several days. ( AP: Kirsty Wigglesworth )  The British Government said it is investing in a coronavirus test that gives results in as little as 20 minutes.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock said his Government is expanding trials of two new tests — a no-swab saliva test and another that gives results in minutes.  It's also running a trial on the benefits of repeat testing of people without symptoms.  Britain has hugely expanded its testing capacity since the start of the pandemic, but critics say it is still not doing enough to find and isolate people with the coronavirus.  Anyone with symptoms is eligible for a test, but the BBC reported Thursday that people who enter their postcode into the Government's website are sometimes being directed to drive-through centre hundreds of kilometres away.  Mr Hancock insisted the system was working well despite some ""operational challenges.""  The Government said it has the capacity to perform almost 350,000 tests a day, though only abut 180,000 are actually being processed daily.  Majority of African countries to receive free vaccines  The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX), aims to secure 220 million vaccine doses for Africa. ( AP: Jerome Delay )  The World Health Organization said eight African countries have agreed to self-finance their doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine, with those remaining to receive the doses for free.  The WHO said all of Africa's 54 countries have expressed interest in the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility, or COVAX.  COVAX aims to secure at least 220 million vaccine doses for the Africa's 1.3 billion people.  ""In the past, we Africans have ended up far too often at the back of the queue for vaccines, and we have to ensure that this doesn't happen again,"" said WHO Africa program manager Richard Mihigo.  Over 170 countries have expressed in COVAX, with the goal of securing 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021 so countries can meet the needs of at least 20 percent of their populations, starting with health workers and vulnerable populations like the elderly.  The goal to have ""significant quantities"" of vaccines in the first half of 2021 seems on target, said Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.  Beijing receives international flights for first time since March  An Air China flight from Phnom Penh was the first international flight to land in Beijing in months. ( Supplied: Air China )  Beijing's main international airport on Thursday began receiving flights from a limited number of countries considered at low risk of coronavirus infection.  Passengers flying in from Cambodia, Greece, Denmark, Thailand, Pakistan, Austria, Canada and Sweden, must have first shown a negative nucleic acid test for coronavirus before boarding, Beijing local government spokesperson Xu Hejian told reporters.  Passenger arrivals will be limited to roughly 500 per day during an initial trial period and all will need to undergo additional testing for the virus on arrival, followed by two weeks of quarantine.  The first flight under the new arrangement, Air China 746, arrived from Phnom Penh, Cambodia just before 7:00am (local time).  Back in March, all international flights to Beijing had been redirected to a dozen other cities where passengers were tested and processed before being allowed to travel on to the Chinese capital.  China has recorded a total of 4,634 deaths from COVID-19 among 85,077 cases since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, which sparked the global pandemic.  Pandemic bankrupts one of Europe's largest brothels  One of Europe's biggest brothels has filed for bankruptcy after being unable to operate for months due to coronavirus restrictions.  Germany's Daily Express reported Thursday that the Pascha brothel in Cologne had used up all of its financial reserves paying for the upkeep of its 10-story building and 60 staff.  Loading  As part of a wide range of efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19, the German state of North-Rhine Westphalia, where Cologne is located, banned sex work five months ago.  Organisations representing sex workers have warned that the closure of brothels will likely force sex work underground, where women are at greater risk of exploitation.  Africa's coronavirus case rate falls again  Africa's top public health official said the rate of confirmed new coronavirus cases has fallen again, by 14 per cent from the previous week.  John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC), dismissed the idea of a ""hidden pandemic"" on the continent, insisting that testing has improved significantly in Africa's 54 countries and close to 1 per cent of the continent's total population of 1.3 billion has been tested for the virus.  Loading  He said earlier concerns about testing shortages were disappearing as countries test more, and the easing curve ""represents a sign of hope.""  Africa has a total of 1.2 million confirmed cases, roughly half in South Africa.  ""In the coming weeks we'll see dynamics begin to change with the introduction of antigen tests,"" Mr Nkengasong said, adding they be readily deployed in regional areas.  ""We're very encouraged it can transform the situation.""  ABC/wires"

Victoria state officials say the 53 earlier deaths were determined from reconciling numbers from July and August. An outbreak in the city of Melbourne has raced through dozens of aged-care homes, resulting in hundreds of deaths.  The outbreak in the state appears to be slowly waning, with Victoria officials reporting 81 new confirmed coronavirus cases Friday.

Authorities had earlier lifted a lockdown in Auckland following an outbreak there that began last month, but they continue to limit gathering sizes across the country and mandate that people wear masks on public transport.  Story continues  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Friday that “a cautious approach is the best long-term strategy to get our economy open and freedoms back faster in the long term.”  New Zealand reported five new virus cases Friday, two among returning travelers already in quarantine and three connected to the Auckland outbreak.  ___  SEOUL, South Korea —- The number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in South Korea has stayed below 200 for the second consecutive day amid toughened social distancing rules.  The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday it confirmed 198 additional cases in the latest 24-hour period, taking the country’s total to 20,842, with 331 deaths. About 70% of the new cases were in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.  South Korea has seen an uptick in infections since early last month, mostly linked to churches, restaurants, schools and fitness centers in the Seoul area. The daily case tally surpassed 400 in late August but has since showed a gradual downward trend.  Authorities in the Seoul area have recently restricted dining at restaurants and ordered the shutdown of churches, night establishments and after-school academics.  ___  RENO, Nev. -- Nevada Gov.

The majority of counties in the state have low enough coronavirus case rates to allow for students to attend two days per week. But Public Education Department Secretary Ryan Stewart says the state will not mandate in-person learning during the coronavirus pandemic.  Many districts have decided to keep schools online-only through the end of September. Albuquerque Public Schools, the state’s largest district, has decided against nearly all in-person learning until January.  Stewart says the situation is fluid and some school boards could announce in-person learning plans for younger students as soon as Friday.  ___  NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is declining to say whether he would be vaccinated against the coronavirus when a vaccine becomes available.  The U.S. government has told public health departments to prepare to distribute vaccines as early as Nov. 1 and Lee said Thursday that Tennessee is working to develop a distribution plan.  But the governor also says being vaccinated is a personal choice. Lee says he will do what he wants all Tennesseans to do — to decide if the vaccine is “safe and effective” and to talk to their doctors.  ___  LANSING, Mich. — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says that gyms can reopen after 5 1/2 months of closure and that more organized sports can resume if face masks are worn. The move announced Thursday will lift some coronavirus restrictions that lasted longer in Michigan than in many other states.  The order takes effect next Wednesday and allows for the reopening of fitness centers and indoor pools in a swath of the state that is home to 93% of Michigan’s people. Face coverings will be required at all times inside gyms, including during exercise.  The governor also is allowing athletic competitions to resume in regions where they have been restricted. But her guidance recommends against sports involving more than fleeting contact, such as football, basketball, soccer, lacrosse and hockey.  ___  PHOENIX — Most counties in Arizona have been cleared to transition their schools to some form of in-person learning after improvements in coronavirus data.  The state Department of Health Services said Thursday that eight of Arizona’s 15 counties now meet the benchmarks required to do a hybrid of remote and in-person instruction if they choose to. In addition, two other mostly rural counties got the green light to switch to full-time, in-person classes.  For a county to offer hybrid instruction, it must have a decline in new cases or a rate of less than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in a two-week period, its test positivity rate must be below 7%, and its hospital visits for COVID-19-like illness be below 10%.  ___  CONCORD, N.H. — New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu thinks it’s unrealistic to believe a coronavirus vaccine will be available by Nov. 1 but says his state will be prepared to distribute it if it is.  Federal health officials last week instructed states to be ready to begin distribution by Nov. 1 — two days before elections. The timing raised suspicion among public health experts about whether the Trump administration intends to rush approval for political gain.  Sununu said Thursday that he disagreed with that suspicion and called the letter “a smart move.” He says it's good to ensure everyone is ready just in case.  ___  ROME — Italian health experts have recommended that nursing homes and other residences where disabled and other ‘’fragile” people live gradually allow visitors again with strict rules to guard against the spread of the coronavirus.  Deaths in residences for the elderly figured prominently in the heavy fatality toll of the first months of the pandemic in Italy, where the outbreak began in Europe.  The Superior Health Institute, which advises Italy’s public health system and Health Ministry, published guidelines on Thursday which recognized that meeting with loved ones is an integral part of the residents’ well-being. Still, the recommendations call for “avoiding handshakes, kisses and hugs” between residents and visitors in encounters, preferably held outdoors.  If residents are confined to a bed, then only one visitor should be allowed. If the guidelines are adopted by the government, new residents could be admitted, including from hospitals.  But they would need coronavirus tests and must stay in a separate part of the facility, away from the current residents, for 14 days.  ___  NORMAN, Okla. — More than a dozen University of Oklahoma students gathered outside the university’s administration building Thursday to protest what they say is an inadequate response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Student Kellie Dick, a senior from Shawnee, told The Associated Press that students are violating the university and the city of Norman’s mask mandates at bars, restaurants and fraternity and sorority functions.  In her words: “We really need people to wear their masks. I don’t want this to kill any more people than it already has.”  The protesting students presented a list of 12 demands that include online classes for most subjects, twice-weekly free coronavirus testing for the university's students, faculty and staff, and the prohibition of social gatherings of more than 25 people.  The university's chief COVID-19 official earlier Thursday told the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education that there have been no known transmissions of the virus in classrooms, but that the virus spread occurs in areas OU cannot control.  ___  MILWAUKEE — Milwaukee’s health commissioner is quitting to take a new job, citing the partisan battles management of the coronavirus.  Jeanette Kowalik is joining a national health policy think tank in Washington, D.C. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports Kowalik noted obstacles to testing, public health orders, mask messaging during the pandemic response.  Republican lawmakers brought a successful lawsuit before the state Supreme Court this spring ending Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ “safer at home” order designed to slow the spread of the virus. A conservative law firm has filed a lawsuit seeking to end the Evers mask mandate, which the Republican Senate majority leader has denounced.  Milwaukee has reported more than 17,700 positive cases and more than 275 deaths. Wisconsin has reported 1,142 deaths, according to the state Department of Health Services.  ___  PITTSBURGH — Federal agents searched two nursing homes Thursday near Pittsburgh, one of which had the worst coronavirus outbreak of any in Pennsylvania and was already being investigated by the state on suspicion of criminal neglect.  U.S. Attorney Scott Brady says agents were at the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County, as well as at the Mount Lebanon Rehabilitation and Wellness Center, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.  More than 330 of the for-profit Brighton nursing home’s residents tested positive for the virus since the end of March and at least 82 died, the newspaper reported.  A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office confirmed the office was involved in the warrant execution.  ___  MADRID — Spain on Thursday added nearly 9,000 new infections to a total of more than 488,500 since the start of the pandemic.  About 3,600 of the new cases were diagnosed in the past 24 hours, with the others in previous days but just reported.  The Madrid region, population 6.6 million, accounts for more than a third of the country’s new cases. About 16% of its hospital beds are currently devoted to treating COVID-19 patients, the highest rate in Spain.  With 40 new deaths recorded on Thursday, the total toll rose to 29,234. The figure doesn’t reflect those who have died without being tested for the virus.  ___  FURMAN, S.C. — A fraternity at a South Carolina university has been suspended for at least four years after it hosted a pair of parties that led to the spread of the coronavirus.  In a statement, Furman University says Kappa Alpha held parties at their fraternity house Aug. 21 and Aug. 22 and nearly 60% of those who attended -- at least 29 students -- tested positive for the coronavirus. Those who tested positive have been quarantined, the university says.  Meanwhile, Indiana University officials have requested all 40 fraternity and sorority houses at its Bloomington campus to shut down, saying their high rates of coronavirus infections made them unsafe. Testing at some houses found infection rates above 50 percent."

Chinese aviation authorities are allowing arrivals in Beijing under intense Covid-19 safety rules from Thailand, Cambodia, Pakistan, Greece, Denmark, Austria, Sweden and Canada -- countries deemed low-risk for cross-border infections.  Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed an Air China plane taxiing at the Beijing Capital International Airport after landing from the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.  Passengers disembarked wearing masks and dragging luggage -- some appeared to be in full protective suits -- before going past customs officials and police wearing visors and protective gear.  Travellers arriving in China need to show a negative coronavirus test before boarding, and are subject to centralised quarantine on arrival for 14 days, along with two more tests, officials said this week.  The number of passengers on direct international flights to Beijing is capped at 500 per day during a trial period, CCTV said.  Since late March, Beijing-bound international flights have been diverted to other Chinese cities, where passengers are screened for the coronavirus and quarantine.  Eleven cases were reported Thursday in China, where the coronavirus first emerged late last year. Health officials said they were all imported.  China remains wary of the risk of an influx of cases from other countries now that its local outbreaks have been largely brought under control.  Most foreigners are still forbidden entry into the country.  rox/apj/qan"

Auto refresh feeds  The test result will come in a maximum of seven hours. Till the results come, the passenger will have to remain in the waiting lounge of the entry airport, the order noted.  If the RT-PCR test result is negative, the international passenger will be allowed to catch his or her connecting domestic flight and he or she will not need to undergo any institutional quarantine at the destination city, the ministry's order said.  International passengers who have to take connecting domestic flights after landing in India will have the option of getting themselves tested for COVID-19 at the entry airports, the Civil Aviation Ministry said on Wednesday.  The steepest one-day spike of 4,593 cases was reported on 12 August. The new cases were detected out of 47,744 tests and the positivity rate is 7.44 percent.  The 3,555 new positive cases, which is the second highest single-day spike in the state, include 924 from Kamrup Metropolitan, 236 from Nagaon, 213 from Dibrugarh and 200 from Baksa.  Three of the fresh fatalities were reported from Dibrugarh, two each from Karimganj and Kamrup Metropolitan and one from Darrang, he said.  The COVID-19 death toll in Assam rose to 323 after eight more people succumbed to the disease, while 3,555 new infections increased the state's caseload to 1,15,279, Health and Family Welfare Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Wednesday.  ""The normal time required to obtain these permits presents a significant barrier to the success of this urgent public health program,"" Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told states in an 27 August letter.  Dallas-based wholesaler McKesson Corp. has a deal with the federal government and will be requesting permits to set up distribution centers when a vaccine becomes available.  The Trump administration has urged US states to get ready to distribute a potential Covid-19 vaccine by 1 November – two days before the presidential election.  Regional restrictions imposed on the towns of Bolton and Trafford in England's Greater Manchester area were due to be lifted on Wednesday but at the last minute they were prolonged.  The new measures come amid a steady uptick in cases across Britain, which has suffered Europe's deadliest outbreak of Covid-19, with more than 41,500 confirmed deaths.  Coronavirus restrictions were tightened in the Scottish city of Glasgow and extended in parts of northern England on Wednesday following a surge in infection rates.  Government spending, fuelled by four coronavirus response measures, would register at USD 6.6 trillion, USD 2 trillion-plus more than 2019.  The USD 3.3 trillion figure is more than triple the 2019 shortfall and more than double the levels experienced after the market meltdown and Great Recession of 2008-09.  The spike in the deficit means that federal debt will exceed annual gross domestic product next year a milestone that would put the US where it was in the aftermath of World War II, when accumulated debt exceeded the size of the economy.  The federal budget deficit is projected to hit a record USD 3.3 trillion as huge government expenditures to fight the coronavirus and to prop up the economy have added more than USD 2 trillion to the federal ledger, the Congressional Budget Office said.  According to the ministry of health, India on Thursday witnessed an unprecedented surge in testing. Over 11,70,000 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours.  State RJD president Abhay Kumar Singh said he did not have any information about the MLA's arrival. He refused to comment on the action taken by the administration.

RJD MLA from Bihar's Barachatti, Samta Devi, one of her associates and two security guards were quarantined by the Ranchi administration on Wednesday after they arrived at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) here to meet party president Lalu Prasad Yadav.  Delhi recorded the highest number of daily new coronavirus cases in over two months with 2,509 infections, pushing the total to 1,79,569. The last time the city reported more than 2,500 cases was on 3 July.  The actor said he along with his wife, Lauren Hashian, and two young daughters contracted the virus, but have now recovered. He said his daughters “bounced back” after having sore throats for a couple of days.  Johnson announced their diagnosis in an 11-plus minute video on Instagram on Wednesday. He said he was shocked after hearing their positive tests, calling the ordeal “one of the most challenging and difficult things we’ve ever had to endure.”  Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson shared some unfortunate news on his home front, he and his family tested positive for the coronavirus.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had last month permitted one-time restructuring of both corporate and retail loans without getting classified as a non-performing asset.  Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will hold a review meeting with heads of banks and NBFCs today for smooth and speedy implementation of the one-time debt recast for resolution of COVID-19 related stress in bank loans.  India reports 83,883 new coronavirus cases and 1,043 deaths in the last 24 hours, according to health ministry data. With this, the country now has 38,53,407 cases and the toll has risen to 67,376. This is the highest rise in cases so far.  It said over one lakh patients had recovered so far from the killer virus.

The decision to withhold roughly USD 62 million in outstanding 2020 dues to the WHO is part of President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the organisation over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his allegations that the agency has been improperly influenced by China.  The announcement on Wednesday came just a day after the White House announced the US would not participate in a WHO-run project to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine.  The Trump administration has said it won't pay more than USD 60 million in dues it owes to the World Health Organisation and will use the money instead to pay down other contributions to the United Nations.  There are now 381 active COVID-19 cases in the islands, he said.  Four new patients have travel history, while 22 infections were detected during contact tracing, he said.

Bauchner, the editor-in-chief of JAMA, which published five papers about the treatment.  Based on the new evidence, the World Health Organization issued new treatment guidance, strongly recommending steroids to treat severely and critically ill patients, but not to those with mild disease.  International clinical trials published Wednesday confirm the hope that cheap, widely available steroid drugs can help seriously ill patients survive COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.  Sule, whose party is an ally of the Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government, said only parcel service is allowed at present as far as the restaurants are concerned, and noted it is not enough to bring the business back on track.  The state government on Monday allowed hotels and lodges to operate at 100 per cent capacity, as part of its efforts to ease the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19.

We sought information from five-six hospitals and got to know that 70-80 percent patients there have come from outside Delhi. There might be issues in particular hospitals, but there is no issue of beds."" he said.  Britain has hugely expanded its testing capacity since the start of the pandemic, but critics say it is still not doing enough to find and isolate people with the coronavirus.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the government is expanding trials of two new tests a no-swab saliva test and another that gives results in minutes. It's also running a trial on the benefits of repeat testing of people without symptoms.  The British government says it is investing in a coronavirus test that gives results in as little as 20 minutes, as critics say tests for the virus are being rationed because the system can't cope with demand.  ""The BJP should use other electronic media to enable the MPs to question the government,"" he added.  ""The BJP is using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to cancel the Question Hour in the monsoon session of Parliament to hide its failures on multiple fronts,"" NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase alleged.

Permissions and approvals will be given only for safe zones,"" an official spokesman of the Home Department said while detailing the guidelines for film shootings.  As per the guidelines, the duration of the shooting should be restricted to the minimum possible time and not more than 50 people should be allowed to be present at a spot.  The Haryana government on Thursday issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) and guidelines for resuming film shootings in the state that include measures such as social distancing and mandatory use of face covers or masks for cast and crew, except for actors in front of the camera.  After a brief lull, Delhi has seen a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases over the last few days.  He said Delhi's case fatality ratio was 0.75 per cent on Wednesday, which is a good sign. ""Overall, it is 2.5 per cent. Yesterday, it was less than one per cent, which is a good sign. At one time, it was 3.5 per cent,"" he added.  Asked if Delhi is heading towards a second wave of coronavirus infections, Jain said, ""You cannot say it is a second wave. We could have called it a second wave if there were no positive cases for one or two months and then cases would have started coming again. The virus is still there in Delhi. You should not stress about numbers.""  Speaking to reporters, he said people ""should not stress about numbers"". The minister said the Delhi government is increasing the testing for COVID-19 and it wants that there should be no positive case in the city.  It can't be said that Delhi is witnessing a second wave of COVID-19, Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday, a day after the national capital recorded 2,509 fresh cases – the highest single-day spike in nearly two months.

He was also quoted by PTI as saying, ""India has 2,792 cases of COVID-19 per million population which is amongst lowest in the world.""  Union health ministry secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Thursday said, ""Per million COVID-19 cases in the country is much lesser when compared to other countries in the world.

Beijing to receive international flights  Globally, the viral infection has affected over 2.58 crore people and claimed the lives of over 8.58 lakh, according to John Hopkins University's coronavirus tracker.  In China, where the first cases surfaced, authorities said the flights from low caseload countries will be allowed into Beijing starting on Thursday, after a freeze of over five months.  The new rules will apply to flights from Thailand, Cambodia, Pakistan, Greece, Denmark, Austria, Sweden and Canada, all with low numbers of imported cases of the virus, reported news agency AFP.  But travellers would be subject to centralised quarantine on arrival for 14 days and have to take two coronavirus tests, an official said.  ""Starting 3 September, international passenger flights to Beijing, which previously had their entry points diverted, will gradually resume,"" the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in a statement.  Since late March, as many as 511 Beijing-bound international flights have been diverted to other Chinese cities where passengers are screened for the coronavirus before being allowed to travel on to Beijing, the political heart of the country.

Demanding urgent action from Boris Johnson, they warned 14-day quarantine was crippling travel, wrecking trade prospects and jeopardising the recovery. The chief executive of Heathrow accused the Government of ‘doing nothing to protect jobs’.  ‘What makes me more angry is that we are putting this country’s future at risk,’ said John Holland-Kaye.  ‘We weren’t born as one of the world’s great trading nations. We got there through hard work and ingenuity over decades. And all that work will be lost if we stand by and do nothing to safely open up our borders.’  British Airways boss Willie Walsh said quarantine was ‘throttling business and holiday plans and handcuffing our economic recovery’. The Daily Mail is leading calls for testing at airports and ports to get the country and economy moving again.  Pictured: A British Airways plane takes off from the northern runway at Heathrow Airport - Britain’s biggest and busiest. It would normally handle around 1,300 flights every day in September, with 220,000 passengers coming and going. Yesterday there were just 504 flights landing and taking off, with many planes far from full  Airlines UK, the Airport Operators Association, Virgin Atlantic, EasyJet, Airbus and Rolls-Royce are all backing the campaign. Gatwick, Manchester, Stansted, Southend, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton airports also pledged their support.  Tony Blair said testing at airports was essential to reopening the economy. The former prime minister added: ‘Testing after travel will reduce quarantine and eventually replace it altogether.  ‘By maximising all the testing capacity at our disposal and continuing to bring online new, innovative on-the-spot tests, we can do this now. It will be essential to getting international travel back and revitalising the economy.’  Travel industry leaders are furious at the failure to bring in airport testing, with one warning ministers were ‘presiding over the demise of the aviation industry’.  Empty: Terminal 5 at Heathrow was devoid of tourists today as business chiefs call for Britain to get flying again. Heathrow would normally handle around 1,300 flights every day in September, with 220,000 passengers coming and going. Yesterday there were just 504 flights landing and taking off, with many planes far from full  The quarantine system – in which travellers have to self-isolate for 14 days if they arrive in the UK from a ‘red list’ country – has been in place since June. It has caused mayhem for British holidaymakers, tourists from abroad and business travellers.  Countries have been taken off the list – opening up travel bookings – only to be added again a few weeks later when their rate of coronavirus infections increases.  To add to the confusion, the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are able to impose their own rules. This was dramatically illustrated last night when the UK government decided not to add Portugal or Greece to its quarantine list.  Yet travellers in Wales were told they would have to self-isolate for 14 days if they returned from mainland Portugal or any of six Greek islands.  The number of foreigners coming to Britain has collapsed with devastating consequences for London and other tourist hotspots.  At least there’s no queue: Gatwick’s North Terminal. Travel bosses have pointed out that other countries have introduced testing regimes that reduce the need for quarantine  As bookings plummet 90%, Eurostar shuts Kent stations Eurostar is to mothball its stations in Kent until 2022, raising fears of hundreds of job losses. The train operator blamed quarantine restrictions for a 90 per cent drop in bookings compared to last year. Its trains have not been stopping at Ashford International or Ebbsfleet International stations since March, but that has now been extended to 2022. Ashford MP Damian Green, who was Theresa May’s de facto deputy, said yesterday it was a ‘huge blow’. He said: ‘As long as people are worried about travelling abroad, the traffic will not be back. 'That undermines the urgency of getting a vaccine or some other way, such as more and quicker testing. If people could be tested going in and out of the country, then they could travel with confidence nearly as good as a vaccine.’ A Eurostar spokesman said: ‘Covid-19 has had a severe impact on the travel industry... it is crucial we adapt and take action to reduce our costs so that we protect our business for the future.’ Advertisement  Travel bosses point out that countries including Germany, France, Italy and Iceland have managed to introduce a testing regime to eliminate or reduce the need for quarantine. They have spent months calling for passengers to be tested on arrival and then again a few days later. Experts on the Sage committee endorsed the idea two months ago.  Minutes from the scientific advisory group show it asked Public Health England to consider such a policy after research found tests after five days would pick up 85 per cent of coronavirus cases, and 96 per cent after eight days.  The plan would have allowed people to finish quarantine within a week. However aviation bosses say the Department for Transport has ‘stopped engaging’ on the issue.  Heathrow has even built its own testing centre ready to test thousands of arrivals – but the multi-million pound facility is gathering dust. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has not even asked to visit.  Sources have blamed the lack of action on Whitehall infighting. One senior Tory MP said that although Mr Shapps supports testing, other departments are concerned about ‘false negative’ results and other potential problems.  Jet2 last night cancelled all flights and holidays to Spain and Croatia for the rest of the summer season. The tour operator blamed the quarantine measures for ruining thousands of holidays. A spokesman said: ‘We urge the Government to continue to help holidaymakers by implementing a targeted approach to travel advice, instead of the current blanket approach.’  The quarantine rules are being opposed by more than 80 MPs, half of them Conservatives.  Steve Baker, Tory former minister and MP for High Wycombe, said: ‘If the Government can provide fast accurate lateral-flow tests at airports to enable people to avoid quarantine when they come back, then they must deploy them widely.  ‘As an MP for a constituency west of Heathrow, I see through my mailbox the devastating impact of coronavirus on the ground crew, the pilots and the cabin crew.’  The first international flight in more than five months landed in China’s capital yesterday with the passengers greeted by airport staff in full hazmat suits.  Initially the Chinese are allowing flights from Thailand, Cambodia, Pakistan, Greece, Denmark, Austria, Sweden and Canada – countries deemed low risk.  Eleven cases were reported yesterday in China, where the coronavirus first emerged late last year.  ... and how it used to be  Airports in early September are usually full of families flying back for the new school year – or canny holidaymakers heading out on cut-price term-time deals.  Sadly, the gates at Gatwick and Heathrow were all but empty yesterday. In fact, departures at Heathrow’s Terminal 5 was literally deserted at one point, as seen above.  The airport – Britain’s biggest and busiest – would normally handle around 1,300 flights every day in September, with 220,000 passengers coming and going. Yesterday there were just 504 flights landing and taking off, with many planes far from full.  How it was last year: Chaos at Heathrow Terminal 5 arrivals as warm weather and a lack of staff paints a very different scene to this years' scenes at the airport. In a typical year, Heathrow would normally handle around 1,300 flights every day in September  Pictured: Travellers at Gatwick airport make their way to the departure gate at the end of August last year"

Those deaths plus six that officials reported Friday for the previous 24 hours raises Australia’s toll from the pandemic to 737.  Victoria state officials say the 53 earlier deaths were determined from reconciling numbers from July and August. An outbreak in the city of Melbourne has raced through dozens of aged-care homes, resulting in hundreds of deaths.  The outbreak in the state appears to be slowly waning, with Victoria officials reporting 81 new confirmed coronavirus cases Friday.

Authorities had earlier lifted a lockdown in Auckland following an outbreak there that began last month, but they continue to limit gathering sizes across the country and mandate that people wear masks on public transport.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Friday that “a cautious approach is the best long-term strategy to get our economy open and freedoms back faster in the long term.”  New Zealand reported five new virus cases Friday, two among returning travelers already in quarantine and three connected to the Auckland outbreak.  ———  SEOUL, South Korea —- The number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in South Korea has stayed below 200 for the second consecutive day amid toughened social distancing rules.  The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday it confirmed 198 additional cases in the latest 24-hour period, taking the country’s total to 20,842, with 331 deaths. About 70% of the new cases were in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.  South Korea has seen an uptick in infections since early last month, mostly linked to churches, restaurants, schools and fitness centers in the Seoul area. The daily case tally surpassed 400 in late August but has since showed a gradual downward trend.  Authorities in the Seoul area have recently restricted dining at restaurants and ordered the shutdown of churches, night establishments and after-school academics.  ———  RENO, Nev. -- Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak says he is pursuing the possibility of easing pandemic restrictions on religious gatherings as a rural church pushes forward with its legal effort to strike down the current 50-person cap as unconstitutional.  Lawyers for Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley filed new briefs in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday after the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly refused its bid in July for an emergency order suspending the hard cap.  Sisolak, who is Catholic, said Thursday he has asked his advisers to review whether the state can ease that restriction and allow churches to expand how many people can attend.  ———  RIO DE JANEIRO — The number of confirmed cornavirus cases in Brazil has risen above 4 million. Data the health ministry released Thursday evening also shows that the virus has caused nearly 125,000 deaths in Brazil since the pandemic began.  Both totals are the second highest for any country in the world, behind the United States, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.  Latin America’s largest nation has seen its daily number of new cases fall over the past six weeks, but it continues to report more than 35,000 per day. Its weekly COVID-19 death toll has also started to tip downward after a prolonged, elevated plateau.  ———  SANTA FE, N.M. -- Some grade schools in New Mexico will be allowed to have in-person learning next week, but it’s unclear how many are signing up.  The majority of counties in the state have low enough coronavirus case rates to allow for students to attend two days per week. But Public Education Department Secretary Ryan Stewart says the state will not mandate in-person learning during the coronavirus pandemic.  Many districts have decided to keep schools online-only through the end of September. Albuquerque Public Schools, the state’s largest district, has decided against nearly all in-person learning until January.  Stewart says the situation is fluid and some school boards could announce in-person learning plans for younger students as soon as Friday.  ———  NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is declining to say whether he would be vaccinated against the coronavirus when a vaccine becomes available.  The U.S. government has told public health departments to prepare to distribute vaccines as early as Nov. 1 and Lee said Thursday that Tennessee is working to develop a distribution plan.  But the governor also says being vaccinated is a personal choice. Lee says he will do what he wants all Tennesseans to do — to decide if the vaccine is “safe and effective” and to talk to their doctors.  ———  LANSING, Mich. — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says that gyms can reopen after 5 1/2 months of closure and that more organized sports can resume if face masks are worn. The move announced Thursday will lift some coronavirus restrictions that lasted longer in Michigan than in many other states.  The order takes effect next Wednesday and allows for the reopening of fitness centers and indoor pools in a swath of the state that is home to 93% of Michigan’s people. Face coverings will be required at all times inside gyms, including during exercise.  The governor also is allowing athletic competitions to resume in regions where they have been restricted. But her guidance recommends against sports involving more than fleeting contact, such as football, basketball, soccer, lacrosse and hockey.  ———  PHOENIX — Most counties in Arizona have been cleared to transition their schools to some form of in-person learning after improvements in coronavirus data.  The state Department of Health Services said Thursday that eight of Arizona’s 15 counties now meet the benchmarks required to do a hybrid of remote and in-person instruction if they choose to. In addition, two other mostly rural counties got the green light to switch to full-time, in-person classes.  For a county to offer hybrid instruction, it must have a decline in new cases or a rate of less than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in a two-week period, its test positivity rate must be below 7%, and its hospital visits for COVID-19-like illness be below 10%.  ———  CONCORD, N.H. — New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu thinks it’s unrealistic to believe a coronavirus vaccine will be available by Nov. 1 but says his state will be prepared to distribute it if it is.  Federal health officials last week instructed states to be ready to begin distribution by Nov. 1 — two days before elections. The timing raised suspicion among public health experts about whether the Trump administration intends to rush approval for political gain.  Sununu said Thursday that he disagreed with that suspicion and called the letter “a smart move.” He says it's good to ensure everyone is ready just in case.  ———  ROME — Italian health experts have recommended that nursing homes and other residences where disabled and other ‘’fragile” people live gradually allow visitors again with strict rules to guard against the spread of the coronavirus.  Deaths in residences for the elderly figured prominently in the heavy fatality toll of the first months of the pandemic in Italy, where the outbreak began in Europe.  The Superior Health Institute, which advises Italy’s public health system and Health Ministry, published guidelines on Thursday which recognized that meeting with loved ones is an integral part of the residents’ well-being. Still, the recommendations call for “avoiding handshakes, kisses and hugs” between residents and visitors in encounters, preferably held outdoors.  If residents are confined to a bed, then only one visitor should be allowed. If the guidelines are adopted by the government, new residents could be admitted, including from hospitals.  But they would need coronavirus tests and must stay in a separate part of the facility, away from the current residents, for 14 days.  ———  NORMAN, Okla. — More than a dozen University of Oklahoma students gathered outside the university’s administration building Thursday to protest what they say is an inadequate response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Student Kellie Dick, a senior from Shawnee, told The Associated Press that students are violating the university and the city of Norman’s mask mandates at bars, restaurants and fraternity and sorority functions.  In her words: “We really need people to wear their masks. I don’t want this to kill any more people than it already has.”  The protesting students presented a list of 12 demands that include online classes for most subjects, twice-weekly free coronavirus testing for the university's students, faculty and staff, and the prohibition of social gatherings of more than 25 people.  The university's chief COVID-19 official earlier Thursday told the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education that there have been no known transmissions of the virus in classrooms, but that the virus spread occurs in areas OU cannot control.  ———  MILWAUKEE — Milwaukee’s health commissioner is quitting to take a new job, citing the partisan battles management of the coronavirus.

Republican lawmakers brought a successful lawsuit before the state Supreme Court this spring ending Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ “safer at home” order designed to slow the spread of the virus. A conservative law firm has filed a lawsuit seeking to end the Evers mask mandate, which the Republican Senate majority leader has denounced.

Wisconsin has reported 1,142 deaths, according to the state Department of Health Services.  ———  PITTSBURGH — Federal agents searched two nursing homes Thursday near Pittsburgh, one of which had the worst coronavirus outbreak of any in Pennsylvania and was already being investigated by the state on suspicion of criminal neglect.  U.S. Attorney Scott Brady says agents were at the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County, as well as at the Mount Lebanon Rehabilitation and Wellness Center, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.  More than 330 of the for-profit Brighton nursing home’s residents tested positive for the virus since the end of March and at least 82 died, the newspaper reported.  A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office confirmed the office was involved in the warrant execution.  ———  MADRID — Spain on Thursday added nearly 9,000 new infections to a total of more than 488,500 since the start of the pandemic.  About 3,600 of the new cases were diagnosed in the past 24 hours, with the others in previous days but just reported.  The Madrid region, population 6.6 million, accounts for more than a third of the country’s new cases. About 16% of its hospital beds are currently devoted to treating COVID-19 patients, the highest rate in Spain.  With 40 new deaths recorded on Thursday, the total toll rose to 29,234. The figure doesn’t reflect those who have died without being tested for the virus.  ———  FURMAN, S.C. — A fraternity at a South Carolina university has been suspended for at least four years after it hosted a pair of parties that led to the spread of the coronavirus.  In a statement, Furman University says Kappa Alpha held parties at their fraternity house Aug. 21 and Aug. 22 and nearly 60% of those who attended -- at least 29 students -- tested positive for the coronavirus. Those who tested positive have been quarantined, the university says.  Meanwhile, Indiana University officials have requested all 40 fraternity and sorority houses at its Bloomington campus to shut down, saying their high rates of coronavirus infections made them unsafe. Testing at some houses found infection rates above 50 percent."

Those deaths plus six that officials reported Friday for the previous 24 hours raises Australia’s toll from the pandemic to 737.  Victoria state officials say the 53 earlier deaths were determined from reconciling numbers from July and August. An outbreak in the city of Melbourne has raced through dozens of aged-care homes, resulting in hundreds of deaths.  The outbreak in the state appears to be slowly waning, with Victoria officials reporting 81 new confirmed coronavirus cases Friday.  Victoria state chief health officer Brett Sutton says that “this is the stubborn tail of the epidemic curve.”  ___  HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK  — Nevada church resumes court battle over COVID-19 rules  — White House faces skepticism over prospects for a vaccine  — Gov. Cuomo won’t allow NYC to reopen restaurants  — Milwaukee’s health commissioner steps down, cites partisan obstacles  — An independent panel appointed by the WHO to review its co-ordination of the response to the coronavirus pandemic will have access to any internal U.N. agency documents, materials and emails.  — Growth in the U.S. services sector, where most Americans work, slowed in August after a big rebound in July, indicating lingering problems stemming from the coronavirus.  — Because of restrictions and bureaucratic hurdles, more than 1 million unemployed won’t receive a $300 check that President Donald Trump promised.  ___  Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  ___  HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:  WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand’s prime minister says the current coronavirus restrictions will remain in place until at least mid-September as a precautionary measure.  Authorities had earlier lifted a lockdown in Auckland following an outbreak there that began last month, but they continue to limit gathering sizes across the country and mandate that people wear masks on public transport.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Friday that “a cautious approach is the best long-term strategy to get our economy open and freedoms back faster in the long term.”  New Zealand reported five new virus cases Friday, two among returning travellers already in quarantine and three connected to the Auckland outbreak.  ___  SEOUL, South Korea —- The number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in South Korea has stayed below 200 for the second consecutive day amid toughened social distancing rules.  The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday it confirmed 198 additional cases in the latest 24-hour period, taking the country’s total to 20,842, with 331 deaths. About 70% of the new cases were in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.  South Korea has seen an uptick in infections since early last month, mostly linked to churches, restaurants, schools and fitness centres in the Seoul area. The daily case tally surpassed 400 in late August but has since showed a gradual downward trend.  Authorities in the Seoul area have recently restricted dining at restaurants and ordered the shutdown of churches, night establishments and after-school academics.  ___  RENO, Nev. -- Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak says he is pursuing the possibility of easing pandemic restrictions on religious gatherings as a rural church pushes forward with its legal effort to strike down the current 50-person cap as unconstitutional.  Lawyers for Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley filed new briefs in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday after the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly refused its bid in July for an emergency order suspending the hard cap.  Sisolak, who is Catholic, said Thursday he has asked his advisers to review whether the state can ease that restriction and allow churches to expand how many people can attend.  ___  RIO DE JANEIRO — The number of confirmed cornavirus cases in Brazil has risen above 4 million. Data the health ministry released Thursday evening also shows that the virus has caused nearly 125,000 deaths in Brazil since the pandemic began.  Both totals are the second highest for any country in the world, behind the United States, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.  Latin America’s largest nation has seen its daily number of new cases fall over the past six weeks, but it continues to report more than 35,000 per day. Its weekly COVID-19 death toll has also started to tip downward after a prolonged, elevated plateau.  ___  SANTA FE, N.M. -- Some grade schools in New Mexico will be allowed to have in-person learning next week, but it’s unclear how many are signing up.  The majority of counties in the state have low enough coronavirus case rates to allow for students to attend two days per week. But Public Education Department Secretary Ryan Stewart says the state will not mandate in-person learning during the coronavirus pandemic.  Many districts have decided to keep schools online-only through the end of September. Albuquerque Public Schools, the state’s largest district, has decided against nearly all in-person learning until January.  Stewart says the situation is fluid and some school boards could announce in-person learning plans for younger students as soon as Friday.  ___  NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is declining to say whether he would be vaccinated against the coronavirus when a vaccine becomes available.  The U.S. government has told public health departments to prepare to distribute vaccines as early as Nov. 1 and Lee said Thursday that Tennessee is working to develop a distribution plan.  But the governor also says being vaccinated is a personal choice. Lee says he will do what he wants all Tennesseans to do — to decide if the vaccine is “safe and effective” and to talk to their doctors.  ___  LANSING, Mich. — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says that gyms can reopen after 5 1/2 months of closure and that more organized sports can resume if face masks are worn. The move announced Thursday will lift some coronavirus restrictions that lasted longer in Michigan than in many other states.  The order takes effect next Wednesday and allows for the reopening of fitness centres and indoor pools in a swath of the state that is home to 93% of Michigan’s people. Face coverings will be required at all times inside gyms, including during exercise.  The governor also is allowing athletic competitions to resume in regions where they have been restricted. But her guidance recommends against sports involving more than fleeting contact, such as football, basketball, soccer, lacrosse and hockey.  ___  PHOENIX — Most counties in Arizona have been cleared to transition their schools to some form of in-person learning after improvements in coronavirus data.  The state Department of Health Services said Thursday that eight of Arizona’s 15 counties now meet the benchmarks required to do a hybrid of remote and in-person instruction if they choose to. In addition, two other mostly rural counties got the green light to switch to full-time, in-person classes.  For a county to offer hybrid instruction, it must have a decline in new cases or a rate of less than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in a two-week period, its test positivity rate must be below 7%, and its hospital visits for COVID-19-like illness be below 10%.  ___  Loading...

Chris Sununu thinks it’s unrealistic to believe a coronavirus vaccine will be available by Nov. 1 but says his state will be prepared to distribute it if it is.  Federal health officials last week instructed states to be ready to begin distribution by Nov. 1 — two days before elections. The timing raised suspicion among public health experts about whether the Trump administration intends to rush approval for political gain.  Sununu said Thursday that he disagreed with that suspicion and called the letter “a smart move.” He says it’s good to ensure everyone is ready just in case.  ___  ROME — Italian health experts have recommended that nursing homes and other residences where disabled and other ‘’fragile” people live gradually allow visitors again with strict rules to guard against the spread of the coronavirus.  Deaths in residences for the elderly figured prominently in the heavy fatality toll of the first months of the pandemic in Italy, where the outbreak began in Europe.  The Superior Health Institute, which advises Italy’s public health system and Health Ministry, published guidelines on Thursday which recognized that meeting with loved ones is an integral part of the residents’ well-being. Still, the recommendations call for “avoiding handshakes, kisses and hugs” between residents and visitors in encounters, preferably held outdoors.  If residents are confined to a bed, then only one visitor should be allowed. If the guidelines are adopted by the government, new residents could be admitted, including from hospitals.  But they would need coronavirus tests and must stay in a separate part of the facility, away from the current residents, for 14 days.  ___  NORMAN, Okla. — More than a dozen University of Oklahoma students gathered outside the university’s administration building Thursday to protest what they say is an inadequate response to the coronavirus pandemic.

It came after Washington sanctioned Chinese companies involved in fortifying man-made islands in the South China Sea.  ""Any attempt to undermine the normal economic cooperation between China and the Philippines will never succeed,"" declared China's ambassador in Manila, Huang Xilian, welcoming the decision of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.  It's a far cry from 2012.  Back then, piles of rotting fruit sat on Philippine banana plantations.  China had imposed controls on Philippine bananas, claiming pests had been found.  Filipino tourism operators found themselves suffering a sharp decline in business after the Chinese Government issued a travel warning over a ""worsened security situation"".  These measures were seen as punishment for Manila standing up to Beijing over the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea.  Sound familiar?  With recent restrictions on its wine, beef and barley, Australia faces a similar situation today, according to Australian journalist and author Sebastian Strangio, whose new book In the Dragon's Shadow explores how South-East Asia is responding to the rapid rise of China.  Worsening tensions between Canberra and Beijing hit a new low this year with the Federal Government's calls for an inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. Watch Duration: 34 seconds 34 s Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Xining says he believes China was ""singled out"" by Australia.  Beijing issued a travel warning for Australia in July, claiming ""Australian law enforcement agencies have arbitrarily searched Chinese citizens"".  This week, Western Australian grain handler CBH saw its barley barred from export to China after pests were allegedly found in its product.  Beijing's calls to 'sons and daughters'  Australia is home to a large, ethnic Chinese diaspora of more than 1.2 million.  Neighbouring South-East Asia is home to the largest population of so-called overseas Chinese in the world.  Nevertheless, across the region, ethnic Chinese have often been met with suspicion and xenophobia, in some instances, extreme violence.  Mobs targeted ethnic Chinese-owned businesses during May 1998 riots in Jakarta. ( Reuters )  ""Antipathy towards China almost always has a negative impact on ethnic Chinese communities,"" Charlotte Setijadi, a specialist on Chinese diaspora in South-East Asia at Singapore Management University, told the ABC.  The coronavirus pandemic's origins in Wuhan have fuelled anti-Chinese sentiment, she said.  ""The threat of the Chinese during COVID-19 was no longer ideological, political or economic, but it was biological.""  And under President Xi Jinping, China has called upon what it sees as ""sons and daughters"" abroad to help realise the ""Chinese dream"" of national rejuvenation.  Efforts to court political and economic support of ethnic Chinese in the region, Strangio said, ""is reawakening those old fears of dual-loyalties"".  ""China still thinks they're the motherland … I think that's dangerous,"" said Kevin Ng of Suara Peranakan, a Chinese Indonesian collective against racism.  ""The Chinese diaspora — Singaporean, Malaysian, Indonesian Chinese — they have their own culture.""  For Chinese Indonesians, who were partly targeted by mass killings in 1965 and by violent riots in 1998 across Indonesia, Beijing's rhetoric poses the threat of reigniting anti-Chinese hatred, Mr Ng said.  Ethnic Chinese people have been a part of South-East Asian societies for centuries. ( ABC News: Max Walden )  ""Those who orient themselves towards China, they don't just do it for emotional reasons … they do it because of potential commercial gains,"" Dr Setijadi said.  ""In the Indonesian case, a lot of the Chinese tycoons end up looking like they're super close to China.  ""But that's only a very, very small percentage of overseas Chinese.""  China 'relatively unimpeded' in South-East Asia  Just on Australia's doorstep, China's influence already outweighs that of the US, and will only grow further.  Barack Obama's so-called pivot to Asia has been completely abandoned by US President Donald Trump.  Most South-East Asian international relations observers see China as more influential in the region than the US. ( Reuters: Mark Schiefelbein )  ""South-East Asia is the one place where China is relatively unimpeded by another outside power,"" Strangio said.  The Belt and Road initiative — a mammoth infrastructure building scheme stretching from China to Europe — as at the centre of China's economic engagement with South-East Asia.  All 10 member states of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and neighbouring Timor Leste, have signed on.  Leaders pose with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in April 2019. ( President of Russia: Ria Novosti )  A 2019 survey of international relations experts from South-East Asia conducted by Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies found that the region already saw China as more powerful in the region than the US.  ""The region views China as much more influential than the United States today, and this gap is expected to grow in the next 10 years,"" it said.  Analysts say South-East Asian governments view China's rapid rise as both a challenge and an economic opportunity.  But China's message to the region is simply a choice between ""flourishing within a Chinese orbit, or languishing outside of it,"" Strangio said.  ""One unifying attitude among all the South-East Asian countries has been suspicion,"" said Dr Setijadi.  The South China Sea remains a point of contention between China and some ASEAN member states — several of which are claimants in the contested waters.  ""China is a big country and other countries are small countries and that is just a fact,"" then-Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi said to his ASEAN counterparts in relation to the South China Sea a decade ago.

Watch Duration: 36 seconds 36 s US denounces Chinese ""intimidation"" in South China Sea  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared in July this year that this sort of ""predatory world view has no place in the 21st century"".  But moves like the Philippines' this week indicate a growing willingness to placate Beijing and sideline the US.  'Crossroads of superpowers and empires'  Strangio nevertheless argues that Beijing continues to underestimate ""intense nationalism"" in the region.  ""South-East Asia has always been a crossroads of superpowers and empires … [they] don't see why they can't have good relations with both the US and China,"" he said.  Most ASEAN states have more independence than Australia in dealing with Beijing, he said.  This week, a piece in China's state-run tabloid The Global Times opined that Australia risks becoming the ""poor white trash of Asia"" if policymakers push forward with economic decoupling from China.  Chinese developers are pumping lots of money into countries like Cambodia. ( ABC RN: Antony Funnell )  ""We are seen in Beijing as the little brother of the US. In Washington, we're expected to support American initiatives almost reflexively,"" Strangio said.  ""The South-East Asian nations, in general, have avoided making a binary choice between the US and China.""  That is already proving more challenging for Australia."

The total in Peel, which has seen cases spike significantly this week, was the most the region has reported in any single day since late June. According to the health unit, the vast majority of cases reported in the region this week have been in Brampton.  Among Ontario’s 34 health units, Ottawa was the only other to report in the double digits Thursday, with 22 new cases.  As the rate of infection has gone up steadily inside the GTA since early August, the rate of infection in most of the rest of the province have meanwhile been flat to falling — although the GTA growth is now also fuelling an overall province-wide increase.  Ontario saw an average of 130 cases reported daily over the last week. The same seven-day average hit a recent low of 85 cases a day on Aug. 16.  Even with the recent increases, the rate of infection remains well below the worst of the pandemic; Ontario saw that seven-day case average reach a mid-April peak of nearly 600 cases daily.  One new fatal case was reported Thursday, in Windsor-Essex. Meanwhile, Peel Region adjusted its tally of fatal cases down by one.  The province has now seen a total of 44,853 confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,850 deaths.  The vast majority of the province’s COVID-19 patients have since recovered. Ontario lists slightly more than 1,200 active cases of the disease, although that number has been going up in recent weeks.  The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases. This means they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.  The province cautions its separate data, published daily at 10:30 a.m., may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system. In the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”  3:37 p.m. There have been 130,272 cases of COVID-19, of which 9,140 resulted in deaths (and 115,287 have been resolved), according to The Canadian Press.  This breaks down as follows (NOTE: The Star does its own count for Ontario; see elsewhere this file.):  Quebec: 62,933 confirmed (including 5,767 deaths, 55,615 resolved)  Ontario: 42,686 confirmed (including 2,812 deaths, 38,625 resolved)  Alberta: 14,180 confirmed (including 242 deaths, 12,535 resolved)  British Columbia: 5,952 confirmed (including 209 deaths, 4,605 resolved)  Saskatchewan: 1,634 confirmed (including 24 deaths, 1,574 resolved)  Manitoba: 1,264 confirmed (including 16 deaths, 791 resolved)  Nova Scotia: 1,085 confirmed (including 65 deaths, 1,014 resolved)  Newfoundland and Labrador: 269 confirmed (including three deaths, 265 resolved)  New Brunswick: 192 confirmed (including two deaths, 186 resolved)  Prince Edward Island: 44 confirmed, all of which have been resolved  Yukon: 15 confirmed, all of which have been resolved  Repatriated Canadians account for 13 confirmed cases, all of which have been resolved  Northwest Territories: five confirmed, all of which have been resolved  Nunavut says it has no confirmed cases.  1:45 p.m.: The Quebec government will reconsider keeping bars open if the province continues to see an upward trend of new daily COVID-19 cases, Premier Francois Legault said Thursday.  He told reporters that if authorities need to confine Quebecers once again, they will close off specific regions of the province or smaller areas within regions as opposed to locking down the entire population.  Legault was reacting to news that health authorities reported 187 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, representing a significant jump compared to a few weeks ago when the province was reporting fewer than 100 cases a day.  “Over the past two weeks we’ve seen an increase in confirmed cases,” Legault said in St-Raymond, about 60 kilometres west of Quebec City. “We have to be prudent.”  He said there are no immediate plans to close any bars in light of an outbreak at a Quebec City bar that has been connected to nearly 50 recent cases of COVID-19.  Legault said if the number of new daily cases continues to increase, authorities will revisit recent decisions to open bars and to allow indoor public gatherings of up to 250 people.  1:15 p.m.: Nova Scotia’s premier is accusing the province’s teachers’ union of “creating a bunch of noise and rhetoric” by suggesting public schools are unsafe and in “chaos” because educators haven’t been given enough time to prepare for the resumption of classes.  Premier Stephen McNeil was responding to a litany of allegations issued Wednesday by Paul Wozney, president of the 10,000-member Nova Scotia Teachers Union.  Wozney issued a statement saying union members have reported ventilation systems that haven’t been inspected or repaired, windows that won’t open, a lack of proper handwashing stations and hallways filled with furniture that has been moved to make more space in classrooms.  The union leader asked Education Minister Zach Churchill to postpone the beginning of the school year by two days to give teachers, administrators and school staff more time to “sort out the turmoil” and meet new requirements aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19.  McNeil rejected that request today, saying there is no evidence any school is in chaos, and insisted the province’s “kids will be safe.”  However, the premier also said he recognized that many teachers, parents and students are probably feeling anxious about the resumption of classes, saying it will sometimes be difficult adapting to living with an ongoing pandemic.  1:14 p.m. Ontario is easing restrictions for visitors to nursing homes after Labour Day as COVID-19 cases continue creeping upward, with 132 new infections reported Thursday.  That was down from 133 from the previous day and the third-highest since July 31, pushing the number of people with active infections across the province to 1,249 — the most since Aug. 3 amid increasing concerns about a resurgence of the highly contagious virus in major urban centres with children set to return to school.  Health Minister Christine Elliott emphasized that most of the new cases are in the GTA and the nation’s capital with many areas having no new infections, according to the ministry statistics released Thursday.  “Peel is reporting 45 new cases, with 31 in Toronto and 22 in Ottawa. Every other public health unit is reporting five or fewer cases, with 18 units reporting no new cases,” she tweeted. There are 34 regional public health units in Ontario.  The Ministry of Long-Term Care issued an updated policy clarifying that the 626 nursing homes in the province can allow caregivers — including family or friends of residents — to visit and help them “at any time, including during an outbreak, subject to direction from the local public health unit” starting Tuesday.  Each resident, or their substitute decision maker, can designate a maximum of two caregivers who can visit “without time limits,” the ministry said in a statement. A caregiver can also be someone hired to help a resident with feeding, grooming and hygiene, mental stimulation and mobility issues.  Read the full story from the Star’s Rob Ferguson  12:40 p.m.: A lawyer representing a group of Quebec parents is in court today trying to compel the province’s Education Department to provide an online learning option for all families who want it.  Only children with serious medical conditions or who live with someone at risk of severe complications from COVID-19 are able to get an exemption from physically attending elementary and high school classes.  Human rights lawyer Julius Grey told Quebec Superior Court Justice Frederic Bachand the decision to send one’s child to class during the COVID-19 pandemic is an extremely private and personal one.  He’s asking for a safeguard order allowing parents access to online courses for their children immediately, before the case is argued on its merits at a later date.  Grey says the measure would not be difficult to implement, since the government is already offering online courses for students with a medical exemption.  Quebec Premier Francois Legault responded to the lawsuit today, saying the province is facing a teacher shortage and doesn’t have enough educators to offer online learning for all those who want that service.  12:25 p.m.: Canadian Armed Forces members and their civilian colleagues in the Department of National Defence are being strongly encouraged to download the federal government’s smartphone application for tracking potential exposure to COVID-19.  Chief of defence staff Gen. Jonathan Vance and Defence Department deputy minister Jody Thomas say they understand some may have concerns when it comes to privacy and secrecy.  But they say the app has been cleared by Defence Department experts and that while installing it is voluntary, using it is one way military personnel and defence officials can help prevent a second wave of COVID-19.  The call to arms comes as Newfoundland and Labrador joins Ontario as the only provinces using the app, though Saskatchewan has said it is considering whether to join.  Quebec has indicated it does not plan to adopt the app for now.  The government says the app has been downloaded 2.2 million times since it was rolled out in Ontario in late July and that 112 people have voluntarily used it to identify themselves as having COVID-19.  The app uses Bluetooth to exchange randomly generated numbers with nearby smartphones and alerts users if they have been close to someone who later enters a code saying he or she has tested positive for the virus that causes the illness.  12:15 p.m.: South African healthcare workers have protested against poor working conditions and urged the government to end corruption in the purchase of COVID-19 personal protective equipment.  The protesters gathered Thursday in Pretoria and Cape Town, charging that the lives of healthcare workers are endangered as some health facilities have inadequate supplies of protective equipment like surgical masks.  The union leading the demonstrations, the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union, has threatened that its 200,000 public workers will go on strike on Sept. 10 if their issues are not addressed.  11:15 a.m.: The number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Quebec is trending upwards.  Health authorities reported 187 new cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours. The province also reported three additional deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus.  Quebec has had a total of 62,933 COVID-19 cases and 5,767 deaths linked to the virus since the pandemic began.  Hospitalizations decreased by nine compared with the prior day, for a total of 100. Of those patients, 20 are in intensive care.  The spike in new cases comes amid news of a COVID-19 outbreak at a Quebec City bar, which is connected to about 50 recent cases of COVID-19.  10:15 a.m. (updated): Ontario is reporting 132 new cases of COVID-19 in the province today, with the bulk of the new diagnoses concentrated in the Greater Toronto Area.  Health Minister Christine Elliott tweeted that Toronto recorded 31 new cases, with neighbouring Peel Region reporting 45.  Elliott says 22 new cases were identified in Ottawa, but all other health regions in the province recorded five or fewer new cases in the past 24 hours.  She says 18 of the province’s 34 public health units have not documented any new cases at all.  The province did not report any new deaths associated with the virus.  Elliott says Ontario completed more than 26,000 COVID-19 tests over the past day.  The province is now reporting a total of 42,686 confirmed cases of the virus, while the death toll stands at 2,812.  10:15 a.m.: Confidence in the Canadian economy took a dramatic dive over the summer in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic — a whipsaw pivot seen around the world but sharper in Canada than any other country surveyed in a new global public opinion poll.  Sixty-one per cent of Canadians who took part in the Pew Research Center survey released Thursday described the country’s current economic situation as bad, more than twice the 27 per cent who said the same thing last year.  Of the 14 countries included in the poll, the 12 that were also asked the same question last year all reported double-digit reversals in sentiment, with Canada’s 34 percentage-point change leading the way.  “The sharpest uptick in negative assessments has come in Canada, where second-quarter losses in gross domestic product were estimated at 12 per cent,” the centre said in a release. “Negative assessments have also grown by 30 percentage points in the UK, U.S. and Australia.”  The Canadian segment of the survey, conducted by phone with 1,037 adult respondents between June 15 and July 27, carries a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.  10:02 a.m. Walt Disney World will loosen up its no-costumes rule for Magic Kingdom visitors as it moves toward the Halloween season.  From Sept. 15 to Oct. 31, all guests can wear their “funniest, Disney-ist, most creative costumes” to the theme park during regular opening hours, according to a post on the official Disney Parks Blog.  Full-blown costume masks will be allowed only for children younger than 14 years old. And all guests will still be required to wear face coverings as they have at Disney World since the resort reopened in mid-July after its coronavirus shutdown.  Disney says Magic Kingdom will be home to a Halloween-themed cavalcade featuring Mickey Mouse and pals and characters in fall attire on the horse-drawn trolley on Main Street USA. The theme park’s orange Halloween decor will be put up.  10 a.m.: Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson says he and his family tested positive for the coronavirus.  Johnson announced their diagnosis in an 11-plus minute video on Instagram on Wednesday. He said he was shocked after hearing their positive tests, calling the ordeal “one of the most challenging and difficult things we’ve ever had to endure.”  The actor said he along with his wife, Lauren Hashian, and two young daughters contracted the virus, but have now recovered. He said his daughters “bounced back” after having sore throats for a couple days.  But for Johnson and his wife, he said they both had a “rough go.”  Johnson said he and his family caught the virus from close family friends, who told him they did not know where they contracted the virus.  Johnson said the ordeal has made him more conscious. He made several suggestions to combat the virus such as wearing a mask, boost your immune system and commit to wellness.  9:38 a.m.: The number of laid-off Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to a still-elevated 881,000 last week, evidence that the viral pandemic keeps forcing many businesses to slash jobs.  The latest figures, released Thursday by the Labor Department, suggest that nearly six months after the eruption of the coronavirus, the economy is still struggling to sustain a recovery and rebuild a job market that was devastated by the recession. In the previous week, more than 1 million had sought jobless aid.  All told, the government said that 13.3 million people are continuing to receive traditional jobless benefits, up from 1.7 million a year ago.  9:32 a.m. The Turkish soccer federation has reversed an earlier decision and now says league games will be played without spectators in the first half of the new season.  The federation had planned to allow stadiums around the country to operate at a maximum of 30 per cent of capacity from October.  The federation says it is heeding the advice of Turkey’s scientific council to keep fans out of stadiums.  The decision comes as the number of daily infections in the country have risen above 1,500 and COVID-19-related deaths have reached their highest since mid-May.  9:24 a.m.: Statistics Canada says the country’s merchandise trade deficit was $2.45 billion in July as both imports and exports continued to post strong gains, but remained below pre-pandemic levels.  The result compared with an updated deficit figure of $1.59 billion for June. The agency’s initial estimate for that month had been a deficit of $3.19 billion for the month.  Economists on average had expected a deficit of $2.5 billion for July, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.  Statistics Canada says the motor vehicles and parts product category helped boost both imports and exports for the month.  Imports for July rose 12.7 per cent to $47.9 billion as imports of motor vehicles and parts increased 50.3 per cent, while exports rose 11.1 per cent to $45.4 billion as exports of motor vehicles and parts increased 37.0 per cent.  Compared with February, the month before the pandemic brought the economy to a near halt, imports were down 4.1 per cent and exports were off 6.0 per cent.  Loading... Loading... Loading...

Premier Doug Ford and Quebec’s Francois Legault and their cabinets will meet in Mississauga next Tuesday and Wednesday.  “As the economic heart of Canada, Ontario and Qubec have often joined forces to create prosperity for the people of our two provinces,” Ford said in a statement Thursday.  “While the path to economic recovery won’t be easy, we don’t have to go it alone. Our provinces must now work together at this critical juncture to help drive the country forward. I look forward to hosting Premier Legault and members of his cabinet to fast-track a shared path to recovery,” he said.  Legault said it is essential for Quebec and Ontario to lead the Canadian recovery.

That’s according to a count from The Associated Press, based on official numbers offered by health authorities across the region.  Those numbers still may be an undercount, though, as testing in war-torn nations like Libya and Yemen remains extremely limited. The top U.N. official for Libya on Wednesday warned the coronavirus pandemic in the war-ravaged country appears to be “spiraling out of control.” Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who hold parts of the nation, have refused to release virus statistics.  The hardest-hit nation remains Iran, which saw the region’s first major outbreak. Over 21,900 people have died there from the virus, with over 380,000 confirmed cases and 328,000 recoveries.  8:04 a.m.: The amount of clean electricity wasted in Ontario is expected to increase significantly this year as a result of the changes in energy consumption brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the association representing the province’s engineers.  The Ontario Society of Professional Engineers released an updated analysis today that found Ontario wasted a total of 6.5 terawatt-hours of clean electricity last year, which it says is enough to power 720,000 average-sized homes for a year.  The organization says that’s a 12-per-cent increase in wasted electricity compared with 2018 — and it should go up further this year in light of the pandemic.  It says Ontario’s electricity system is built to support businesses operating between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., with a large percentage of homes left idle for at least eight hours a day.  The group says those patterns have “drastically” changed in the last six months, largely due to shifts in workplace and business operations, leading to an “inevitable increase in wasted electricity.”  It says while there have been some periods of peak demand, there remain “many, many hours” where surplus electricity is generated and either wasted or exported at low prices.  That represents a “wasted economic and environmental opportunity,” the association says.  7:49 a.m. A prison inmate in Thailand has tested positive for the coronavirus in the country’s first confirmed locally transmitted case in 100 days, health officials said Thursday.  They identified the inmate as a 37-year-old man arrested for drug abuse who was brought to prison in Bangkok on Aug. 26 and tested positive Wednesday at the prison’s health centre.  Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Wednesday had congratulated the nation for having achieved 100 days without any confirmed local cases of the coronavirus. The last person to test positive was on May 24.  Thailand has sustained relatively light health damage from the pandemic, even though in January it was the first country outside China to confirm a case. But its economy has been devastated by the absence of foreign tourists, who are banned from entry, and by a drop in exports.  7:48 a.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues his virtual tour of Canada Thursday, with electronic visits to the Atlantic provinces.  He conducted a virtual tour of British Columbia on Wednesday, meeting with Premier John Horgan and consulting with business and environmental leaders about how to ensure a green economic recovery from the devastating impact of the pandemic.  Trudeau is planning to unveil what he promises will be a bold recovery plan in a throne speech re-opening Parliament on Sept. 23. The speech will be put to a confidence vote, which could potentially result in the defeat of Trudeau’s minority Liberal government.  With the possibility of a fall election in mind, Thursday’s Atlantic tour appears to have a more political flavour. Trudeau is to be joined by local Liberal MPs as he visits businesses that have used various federal emergency aid programs to stay afloat during the health crisis.  7:33 a.m. West Ham midfielder Tomas Soucek and Leipzig striker Patrik Schick have been quarantined and will miss the Czech Republic’s UEFA Nations League game in Slovakia on Friday.  The team said Thursday that health authorities decided to isolate the two because they were in close contact with a staff member of the national team who tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this week.  The two won’t travel with the team to Slovakia for the game in Bratislava despite both testing negative for the coronavirus.  Slavia Prague goalkeeper Ondrej Kolar also left the team at the request of his club as a preventive measure.  It is not immediately clear if the players will be available for Monday’s Nations League game against Scotland in the Czech city of Olomouc.  7 a.m. When the first weeks of September roll around, nearly every inch of Yvonne Yang’s Pistil Flowers shops is typically covered in orders for the Toronto International Film Festival.  Hotels want fresh blooms to greet high-profile guests; production companies and sponsors like to send congratulatory florals to stars of big films; and event planners and restaurants need a touch of nature to brighten up their spaces for everyone flocking to town.  “September’s generally busy because everyone’s back to work and things are happening and then TIFF just drops and it’s usually a lot of last-minute ordering,” said Yang.  “Usually you have to make it work.”  Yang’s not expecting that this year. TIFF has downsized its slate from the usual 200-plus films to about 50, and while it will offer some in-person screenings and drive-ins, the bulk of the action will be online because Hollywood is staying home and COVID-19 is still lurking.  Read the full story  6 a.m.: The CNE is reporting a loss of $6 million after cancelling this year’s fair due to COVID-19, casting the future of the event into doubt, the executive director said Wednesday.  Unless governments step in to help or the CNE is able to win leasing or licensing concessions from the City of Toronto, it’s possible the historic fair won’t be able to operate past 2021 — and it if can’t open next year due to COVID-19, it may not have a future at all.  “That is a very real possibility,” said executive director Darrell Brown, adding that he doesn’t believe governments won’t step in to save the fair, which has been operating annually since 1879.  Read the exclusive story from Francine Kopun here.  5 a.m.: The pandemic has stretched the usually busy spring real estate season right through the summer with GTA home prices hitting another record last month as the market saw a surge of condo listings, and buyers competing for detached and semi-detached houses.  The average selling price of all home categories — ground level housing and condos — rose 20 per cent year over year in August to $951,404, up $7,738 from July’s average.  Transactions also soared to a record 10,775 sales in August, a 40.3 per cent increase over August 2019, said the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) on Thursday.  Read the full story from Tess Kalinowski here.  4:44 a.m.: A pregnant woman said Thursday she didn’t know she had broken any law when she was handcuffed by police in front of her children in her Australian home and led away in pyjamas for allegedly inciting activists to demonstrate against pandemic lockdown.  Zoe Buhler’s partner helped her livestream the arrest on Wednesday at her home where she lives with two children, aged 3 and 4, in the Victoria state city of Ballarat. The video has been viewed millions of times.  The 28-year-old has since been charged with using social media platforms to incite others to break pandemic restrictions by attending weekend rallies.  Victoria is Australia’s COVID-19 hot spot and its capital Melbourne has been under lockdown restrictions unprecedented in Australia since early August.  4 a.m.: The latest numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of 4 a.m. EDT on Sept. 3, 2020:  There are 129,923 confirmed cases in Canada.  _ Quebec: 62,746 confirmed (including 5,764 deaths, 55,515 resolved)  _ Ontario: 42,554 confirmed (including 2,812 deaths, 38,506 resolved)  _ Alberta: 14,180 confirmed (including 242 deaths, 12,535 resolved)  _ British Columbia: 5,952 confirmed (including 209 deaths, 4,605 resolved)  _ Saskatchewan: 1,624 confirmed (including 24 deaths, 1,571 resolved)  _ Manitoba: 1,244 confirmed (including 14 deaths, 776 resolved)  _ Nova Scotia: 1,085 confirmed (including 65 deaths, 1,014 resolved)  _ Newfoundland and Labrador: 269 confirmed (including 3 deaths, 265 resolved)  _ New Brunswick: 192 confirmed (including 2 deaths, 186 resolved)  _ Prince Edward Island: 44 confirmed (including 44 resolved)  _ Yukon: 15 confirmed (including 15 resolved)  _ Repatriated Canadians: 13 confirmed (including 13 resolved)  _ Northwest Territories: 5 confirmed (including 5 resolved)  _ Nunavut: No confirmed cases  _ Total: 129,923 (0 presumptive, 129,923 confirmed including 9,135 deaths, 115,050 resolved)  3 a.m.: India has registered a record single-day spike of 83,883 new cases, driving the country overall tally to 3.85 million. The Health Ministry on Thursday also reported 1,043 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking total fatalities up to 67,376.  India has been reporting the highest daily increases for more than three weeks. The ministry said the country’s fatality rate had declined to 1.76% and its deaths per million population was “one of the lowest in the world.” Experts say deaths could be substantially undercounted in several states.  3 a.m.: Beijing’s main international airport on Thursday began receiving international flights again from a limited number of countries considered at low risk of coronavirus infection.  Passengers flying in from Cambodia, Greece, Denmark, Thailand, Pakistan, Austria, Canada and Sweden, must have first shown a negative coronavirus test before boarding, city government spokesperson Xu Hejian told reporters.  Passenger arrivals will be limited to roughly 500 per day during a trial period and all will need to undergo additional testing for the virus on arrival, followed by two weeks of quarantine. The first flight under the arrangement, Air China Flight 746, arrived from Pnom Penh, Cambodia, just before 7 a.m.  Wednesday: In planning documents sent last week to public health agencies around the country, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described preparations for two coronavirus vaccines they refer to simply as Vaccine A and Vaccine B. The technical details of the vaccines, including the time between doses and their storage temperatures, match well with the two vaccines furthest along in clinical tests in the United States, made by Moderna and Pfizer.  -  Read Wednesday’s rolling file  Read more about:"

Victoria state officials say the 53 earlier deaths were determined from reconciling numbers from July and August. An outbreak in the city of Melbourne has raced through dozens of aged-care homes, resulting in hundreds of deaths.  The outbreak in the state appears to be slowly waning, with Victoria officials reporting 81 new confirmed coronavirus cases Friday.

Authorities had earlier lifted a lockdown in Auckland following an outbreak there that began last month, but they continue to limit gathering sizes across the country and mandate that people wear masks on public transport.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Friday that ""a cautious approach is the best long-term strategy to get our economy open and freedoms back faster in the long term.""  New Zealand reported five new virus cases Friday, two among returning travelers already in quarantine and three connected to the Auckland outbreak.  ___  SEOUL, South Korea —- The number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in South Korea has stayed below 200 for the second consecutive day amid toughened social distancing rules.  The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday it confirmed 198 additional cases in the latest 24-hour period, taking the country's total to 20,842, with 331 deaths. About 70% of the new cases were in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.  South Korea has seen an uptick in infections since early last month, mostly linked to churches, restaurants, schools and fitness centers in the Seoul area. The daily case tally surpassed 400 in late August but has since showed a gradual downward trend.  Authorities in the Seoul area have recently restricted dining at restaurants and ordered the shutdown of churches, night establishments and after-school academics.  ___  RENO, Nev. -- Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak says he is pursuing the possibility of easing pandemic restrictions on religious gatherings as a rural church pushes forward with its legal effort to strike down the current 50-person cap as unconstitutional.  Lawyers for Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley filed new briefs in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday after the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly refused its bid in July for an emergency order suspending the hard cap.  Sisolak, who is Catholic, said Thursday he has asked his advisers to review whether the state can ease that restriction and allow churches to expand how many people can attend.  ___  RIO DE JANEIRO — The number of confirmed cornavirus cases in Brazil has risen above 4 million. Data the health ministry released Thursday evening also shows that the virus has caused nearly 125,000 deaths in Brazil since the pandemic began.  Both totals are the second highest for any country in the world, behind the United States, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.  Latin America's largest nation has seen its daily number of new cases fall over the past six weeks, but it continues to report more than 35,000 per day. Its weekly COVID-19 death toll has also started to tip downward after a prolonged, elevated plateau.  ___  SANTA FE, N.M. -- Some grade schools in New Mexico will be allowed to have in-person learning next week, but it's unclear how many are signing up.  The majority of counties in the state have low enough coronavirus case rates to allow for students to attend two days per week. But Public Education Department Secretary Ryan Stewart says the state will not mandate in-person learning during the coronavirus pandemic.  Many districts have decided to keep schools online-only through the end of September. Albuquerque Public Schools, the state's largest district, has decided against nearly all in-person learning until January.  Stewart says the situation is fluid and some school boards could announce in-person learning plans for younger students as soon as Friday.  ___  NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is declining to say whether he would be vaccinated against the coronavirus when a vaccine becomes available.  The U.S. government has told public health departments to prepare to distribute vaccines as early as Nov. 1 and Lee said Thursday that Tennessee is working to develop a distribution plan.  But the governor also says being vaccinated is a personal choice. Lee says he will do what he wants all Tennesseans to do — to decide if the vaccine is ""safe and effective"" and to talk to their doctors.  ___  LANSING, Mich. — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says that gyms can reopen after 5 1/2 months of closure and that more organized sports can resume if face masks are worn. The move announced Thursday will lift some coronavirus restrictions that lasted longer in Michigan than in many other states.  The order takes effect next Wednesday and allows for the reopening of fitness centers and indoor pools in a swath of the state that is home to 93% of Michigan's people. Face coverings will be required at all times inside gyms, including during exercise.  The governor also is allowing athletic competitions to resume in regions where they have been restricted. But her guidance recommends against sports involving more than fleeting contact, such as football, basketball, soccer, lacrosse and hockey.  ___  PHOENIX — Most counties in Arizona have been cleared to transition their schools to some form of in-person learning after improvements in coronavirus data.  The state Department of Health Services said Thursday that eight of Arizona's 15 counties now meet the benchmarks required to do a hybrid of remote and in-person instruction if they choose to. In addition, two other mostly rural counties got the green light to switch to full-time, in-person classes.  For a county to offer hybrid instruction, it must have a decline in new cases or a rate of less than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in a two-week period, its test positivity rate must be below 7%, and its hospital visits for COVID-19-like illness be below 10%.  ___  CONCORD, N.H. — New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu thinks it's unrealistic to believe a coronavirus vaccine will be available by Nov. 1 but says his state will be prepared to distribute it if it is.  Federal health officials last week instructed states to be ready to begin distribution by Nov. 1 — two days before elections. The timing raised suspicion among public health experts about whether the Trump administration intends to rush approval for political gain.  Sununu said Thursday that he disagreed with that suspicion and called the letter ""a smart move."" He says it's good to ensure everyone is ready just in case.  ___  ROME — Italian health experts have recommended that nursing homes and other residences where disabled and other ''fragile"" people live gradually allow visitors again with strict rules to guard against the spread of the coronavirus.  Deaths in residences for the elderly figured prominently in the heavy fatality toll of the first months of the pandemic in Italy, where the outbreak began in Europe.  The Superior Health Institute, which advises Italy's public health system and Health Ministry, published guidelines on Thursday which recognized that meeting with loved ones is an integral part of the residents' well-being. Still, the recommendations call for ""avoiding handshakes, kisses and hugs"" between residents and visitors in encounters, preferably held outdoors.  If residents are confined to a bed, then only one visitor should be allowed. If the guidelines are adopted by the government, new residents could be admitted, including from hospitals.  But they would need coronavirus tests and must stay in a separate part of the facility, away from the current residents, for 14 days.  ___  NORMAN, Okla. — More than a dozen University of Oklahoma students gathered outside the university's administration building Thursday to protest what they say is an inadequate response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Student Kellie Dick, a senior from Shawnee, told The Associated Press that students are violating the university and the city of Norman's mask mandates at bars, restaurants and fraternity and sorority functions.  In her words: ""We really need people to wear their masks. I don't want this to kill any more people than it already has.""  The protesting students presented a list of 12 demands that include online classes for most subjects, twice-weekly free coronavirus testing for the university's students, faculty and staff, and the prohibition of social gatherings of more than 25 people.  The university's chief COVID-19 official earlier Thursday told the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education that there have been no known transmissions of the virus in classrooms, but that the virus spread occurs in areas OU cannot control.  ___  MILWAUKEE — Milwaukee's health commissioner is quitting to take a new job, citing the partisan battles management of the coronavirus.  Jeanette Kowalik is joining a national health policy think tank in Washington, D.C. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports Kowalik noted obstacles to testing, public health orders, mask messaging during the pandemic response.  Republican lawmakers brought a successful lawsuit before the state Supreme Court this spring ending Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' ""safer at home"" order designed to slow the spread of the virus. A conservative law firm has filed a lawsuit seeking to end the Evers mask mandate, which the Republican Senate majority leader has denounced.  Milwaukee has reported more than 17,700 positive cases and more than 275 deaths. Wisconsin has reported 1,142 deaths, according to the state Department of Health Services.  ___  PITTSBURGH — Federal agents searched two nursing homes Thursday near Pittsburgh, one of which had the worst coronavirus outbreak of any in Pennsylvania and was already being investigated by the state on suspicion of criminal neglect.  U.S. Attorney Scott Brady says agents were at the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County, as well as at the Mount Lebanon Rehabilitation and Wellness Center, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.  More than 330 of the for-profit Brighton nursing home's residents tested positive for the virus since the end of March and at least 82 died, the newspaper reported.  A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania attorney general's office confirmed the office was involved in the warrant execution.  ___  MADRID — Spain on Thursday added nearly 9,000 new infections to a total of more than 488,500 since the start of the pandemic.  About 3,600 of the new cases were diagnosed in the past 24 hours, with the others in previous days but just reported.  The Madrid region, population 6.6 million, accounts for more than a third of the country's new cases. About 16% of its hospital beds are currently devoted to treating COVID-19 patients, the highest rate in Spain.  With 40 new deaths recorded on Thursday, the total toll rose to 29,234. The figure doesn't reflect those who have died without being tested for the virus."

The Associated Press reported that flights are being allowed in from a limited number of countries deemed to be low-risk for bringing the virus to the city; the United States is not among those allowed to travel to the city.  Passengers from Austria, Canada, Cambodia, Denmark, Greece, Thailand, Pakistan and Sweden will be admitted if they do not show signs of the virus before boarding.  ADVERTISEMENT  Beijing's relaxation of travel rules comes as China has gone weeks without a locally transmitted coronavirus infection, according to health authorities, and has seen only a handful imported from other countries. Flights resumed to other cities in China earlier this year, though U.S. officials blamed Chinese authorities for attempting to block U.S. companies from resuming flights.  Authorities have responded to a handful of localized outbreaks of COVID-19 over the past few months with strict travel restrictions and lockdown measures, allowing officials to prevent the virus from spreading.  U.S. officials have blamed China's early handling of the outbreak for the global spread of the virus, while the U.S. has now become home to more than 6 million confirmed cases and is continuing to report thousands of new positive tests per day.  The Trump administration has also accused China of hiding its true number of confirmed cases and preventing global health experts from learning about the virus in a timely fashion.  Domestic and international air travel has plummeted amid the pandemic, falling 96 percent lower than the same time in 2019."

Passengers flying in from Cambodia, Greece, Denmark, Thailand, Pakistan, Austria, Canada and Sweden must have first shown a negative coronavirus test before boarding, city government spokesperson Xu Hejian told reporters.  Passenger arrivals will be limited to roughly 500 per day during a trial period and all will need to undergo additional testing for the virus on arrival, followed by two weeks of quarantine. The first flight under the arrangement, Air China Flight 746, arrived from Pnom Penh, Cambodia, just before 7 a.m.  Beginning in March, all international flights to Beijing had been redirected to a dozen other cities where passengers were tested and processed before being allowed to travel on to the Chinese capital.  China has gone weeks without new cases of local infection and the 11 new cases recorded Thursday were all imported.  Beijing’s last local outbreak in July was linked to a wholesale food market, and the city’s customs department announced Wednesday it would test all imported frozen foods, along with other goods arriving from countries considered to be at high risk.  Storage and transportation facilities for imported food would also be disinfected and Beijing customs would work with other cities to ensure the safety of the supply chain.  In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:  — A prison inmate in Thailand has tested positive for the coronavirus in the country’s first confirmed locally transmitted case in 100 days, health officials said Thursday. They identified the inmate as a 37-year-old man arrested for drug abuse who was brought to prison in Bangkok on Aug. 26 and tested positive Wednesday at the prison’s health centre. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Wednesday had congratulated the nation for having achieved 100 days without any confirmed local cases of the coronavirus. Thailand has sustained relatively light health damage from the pandemic, even though in January it was the first country outside China to confirm a case. But its economy has been devastated by the absence of foreign tourists, who are banned from entry, and by a drop in exports. Dr. Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the Health Ministry’s Disease Control Department, stressed that the infected man had been kept in a small group of quarantined inmates in a standard procedure to limit the possible spread of the virus.  — India has registered a record single-day spike of 83,883 new cases, driving the country overall tally to 3.85 million. The Health Ministry on Thursday also reported 1,043 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking total fatalities up to 67,376. India has been reporting the highest daily increases for more than three weeks. The ministry said the country’s fatality rate had declined to 1.76% and its deaths per million population was “one of the lowest in the world.” Experts say deaths could be substantially undercounted in several states.  — South Korea reported its first drop below 200 new coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, but the country’s strained hospitals were treating more seriously ill patients after the prolonged recent surge in infections. Thursday’s increase of 195 new cases, the first daily increase below 200 in 17 days, indicated the country was beginning to see the effects of stringent social distancing restrictions recently imposed in the greater capital area. However, the number of patients in serious or critical condition with active COVID-19 increased to 154, compared to 14 on Aug. 14 when the country began what’s now a 21-day run in triple-digit daily jumps in infections. The country has added more than 5,800 newly ill people to its caseload during the streak, raising fears about overwhelmed hospitals.  — Hong Kong says just six people have tested positive for the coronavirus out of 128,000 residents who have taken part in the city’s mass testing program that began Tuesday. Four of the six people were previous coronavirus patients who were discharged last month and still carried traces of the virus when they were tested. As of Thursday, 850,000 people in the city of 7.5 million have registered to take part in the weeklong free testing program aimed at identifying silent carriers of the virus. The low number of positive cases has drawn criticism that the testing program is not cost-effective, amid privacy concerns and fears that DNA data could be sent to mainland China. Coronavirus infections surged in Hong Kong in early July. At its peak, the territory recorded more than 100 locally transmitted cases a day, after going weeks without any in June. Tough restrictions were imposed, including limiting restaurant dining-in hours and shuttering bars and karaoke lounges, and cases have steadily dwindled. Apart from the six people who tested positive in the mass testing program, Hong Kong reported eight other coronavirus infections on Thursday. It has confirmed a total of 4,839 cases, including 93 deaths.  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

The state health department said there had been 113 new infections and 15 deaths in the latest 24-hour period. There were 90 new infections and six deaths recorded on Wednesday. There were only 70 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, the lowest tally since June.  — A pregnant woman in Australia says she didn’t know she was breaking any law when she was handcuffed by police in front of her children and led away in her pyjamas for allegedly inciting people to demonstrate against Victoria state’s pandemic lockdown. Zoe Buhler’s partner helped her live stream the arrest on Wednesday at her home where she lives with two children aged 3 and 4 in the city of Ballarat. The video has been viewed millions of times. She has been charged with using social media platforms to incite others to break pandemic restrictions by attending weekend rallies to protest the restrictions.  Read more about:"

What makes our community so special is its diverse members, and the rich and varied perspectives they contribute. The Tableau Community is a place where passionate data people of all backgrounds can come together and learn from each other. Data visualization is a process of discovery, and a powerful tool for understanding different perspectives and communicating across contexts, geographies, and experiences. We are committed to ensuring that our community reflects, prioritizes, and elevates the diversity of its members.  Recently, Tableau CEO Adam Selipsky introduced the Racial Justice Data Initiative: A Tableau-wide effort to empower changemakers to use data to directly address the prejudice, violence, and structural inequities Black communities face across the country. As part of this initiative, Tableau is also looking inward: We will be making changes to ensure our company is a place where diverse people and perspectives are not just welcome and elevated, but are also openly heard and considered. That applies to the Tableau Community as well.  As part of the Racial Justice Data Initiative, we are committing to improving diversity and inclusion across our global community, which includes our Ambassador and Zen Master program, User Groups, and how we show up as a community in all we do. Our goal is to improve representation for all diverse groups across our community, and ensure that in doing so, we’re creating a safe and inclusive space for all to participate. To hold Tableau and our passionate community accountable to this commitment, we have established a Community Equity Task Force that will meet monthly to discuss progress and strategies for improving representation and inclusion.  In selecting the twelve members of the inaugural Tableau Community Equity Task Force, we aimed to be deliberately inclusive of currently under-represented groups across several factors including gender, race, and geographic location.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the government is expanding trials of two new tests — a no-swab saliva test and another that gives results in minutes. It’s also running a trial on the benefits of repeat testing of people without symptoms.  Britain has hugely expanded its testing capacity since the start of the pandemic, but critics say it is still not doing enough to find and isolate people with the coronavirus.  Anyone with symptoms is eligible for a test, but the BBC reported Thursday that people who enter their postcode into the government’s website are sometimes being directed to drive-through centers hundreds of miles away.  Hancock insisted the system was working well despite some “operational challenges.”  The government says it has the capacity to perform almost 350,000 tests a day, though only abut 180,000 are actually being processed daily.

The group says Mexico has reported 1,320 confirmed deaths from COVIID-19 so far, surpassing the United States at 1,077, the United Kingdom at 649, and Brazil at 634.  — New studies confirm that multiple types of steroids improve survival for severely ill COVID-19 patients, cementing the cheap drugs as a standard of care.  — Scientists are reporting that the antibodies people make to fight the new coronavirus do not fade quickly. The new study is the most extensive work yet on the immune system’s response to the virus and is good news for efforts to develop vaccines.  CDC: CORONAVIRUS VACCINE COULD ARRIVE IN OCTOBER, NOVEMBER; ASKS STATES TO PREPARE  ___  HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:  LONDON — Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline say they are beginning human trials of a potential vaccine for COVID-19 after positive results from preclinical testing.  The drugmakers said Thursday they plan to test the vaccine on 440 adults at 11 sites in the U.S., with the first results expected in early December. If these tests are successful, the companies plan to begin large-scale trials later that month.  Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline say they plan to seek regulatory approval for the vaccine in early 2021 if data from the trials supports it.  The two companies in July announced plans to collaborate with the U.S. government to produce up to 100 million doses of the vaccine, with the government taking an option to purchase up to 500 million more doses in the future. The British government has agreed to buy up to 60 million doses.  ___  ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey is expanding restrictions imposed on social gatherings such as wedding and engagement parties and henna nights in more than a dozen provinces to the entire country.  An Interior Ministry circular sent to Turkey’s 81 provinces late Wednesday says such social gatherings will banned from Friday. Marriage registration ceremonies will be allowed but will be restricted to one hour only.  The decision came after the health minister said the country is experiencing the second peak of the first wave of the coronavirus outbreak and blamed gatherings at weddings and holidays.  The number of daily infections have tipped above 1,500 — levels previously seen in mid-June. More than 273,000 people have tested positive for the virus in Turkey since March.  ___  PRAGUE — The Czech Republic has registered the biggest day-to-day increase in the new confirmed cases of COVID-19.  The Health Ministry says a record 650 people tested positive on Wednesday, up from 504 on Tuesday.  Health Minister Adam Vojtech says new restrictions are likely to be imposed.  Vojtech is currently quarantined after a senior official in his department tested positive for COVID-19.  The Czech Republic has had 25,773 confirmed infections with 425 deaths.  ___  LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles City Council has declared a fiscal emergency because of the coronavirus pandemic, paving the way to furlough about 15,000 employees.  Wednesday’s declaration comes as the city looks at a tax shortfall this year of up to $400 million.  Mayor Eric Garcetti is expected to approve the measure.  The furloughs, which would begin Oct. 11, would require civilian employees to take up to 18 days off from work. But a labor union official tells the Los Angeles Daily News that the furloughs violate labor contracts and will be vigorously fought.  ___  BEIJING — Beijing’s main international airport on Thursday began again receiving international flights from a limited number of countries considered at low risk of coronavirus infection.  Passengers flying in from Cambodia, Greece, Denmark, Thailand, Pakistan, Austria, Canada and Sweden, must have first shown a negative nucleic acid test for coronavirus before boarding, city government spokesperson Xu Hejian told reporters.  Passenger arrivals will be limited to roughly 500 per day during an initial trial period and all will need to undergo additional testing for the virus on arrival, followed by two weeks of quarantine. The first flight under the new arrangement, Air China 746, arrived from Pnom Penh, Cambodia just before 7 a.m.  Beginning in March, all international flights to Beijing had been redirected to a dozen other cities where passengers were tested and processed before being allowed to travel on to the Chinese capital.  China has gone weeks without new cases of local infection and on Thursday recorded 11 cases brought from outside the country. China has recorded a total of 4,634 deaths from COVID-19 among 85,077 cases since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, sparking the global pandemic.  WEAR A MASK DURING SEX, SKIP KISSING, CANADA'S TOP DOCTOR SUGGESTS  ___  LOS ANGELES -- Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson says he and his family tested positive for the coronavirus.  Johnson announced their diagnosis in an 11-plus minute video on Instagram on Wednesday.  The actor says he was shocked after hearing their positive tests. He called the ordeal “one of the most challenging and difficult things we’ve had ever to endure.”  The actor said he along with wife, Lauren Hashian, and two young daughters contracted the virus, but have now recovered.  He says his daughters “bounced back” after having sore throats for a couple days. But for Johnson and his wife, he says they both had a “rough go.”  ___  SAN DIEGO -- San Diego State University has halted in-person classes for a month after dozens of students were infected with the coronavirus.  The school announced Wednesday that about 200 course offerings, some of them lab classes, will move to virtual learning. On-campus housing will remain open.  San Diego County health officials say there have been 64 confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 among SDSU students since classes resumed last week. Some, but not all, of the infections were linked to other cases at the university. Some involve students who live off-campus.  California State university at Chico also halted classes this week.  ___  SANTA FE, N.M. -- A top state health official is warning that COVID-19 infections are far more prevalent in low-income areas of the New Mexico, potentially straining Medicaid health care.  Human Services Secretary David Scrase said Wednesday that an analysis of infection rates by census tract shows that highly impoverished areas have infection rates seven times higher than the most affluent zones.  Scrase and Children Youth and Families Secretary Brian Blalock gave a briefing on public health trends and the state’s coronavirus response.  State health officials are wary that festivities over the Labor Day holiday weekend could lead to renewed surges in COVID-19 infections.  ___  URBANA, Ill. — The University of Illinois is ramping up enforcement of restrictions on student activity after more than 330 COVID-19 cases in two days on the school’s Urbana-Champaign campus, school officials said Wednesday.  In an email to students, Chancellor Robert Jones said he expects all undergraduates to ""limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities” for the next two weeks starting Wednesday evening.  “These include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention,” Jones wrote.  The University of Illinois isn’t the only university in the state seeing a spike in COVID-19 cases. Illinois State University in Normal is reporting about 1,025 students have tested positive since the start of the fall semester two weeks ago, nearly 5% of the student body.  Since students returned to the Urbana-Champaign campus Aug. 16, more than 1,000 people on campus have tested positive. University officials say about 800 people are currently in quarantine.  ___  ATLANTA — With more than 3,000 public university students and employees across Georgia testing positive for COVID-19 since Aug. 1, some schools are taking action to slow the spread of the respiratory illness.  Georgia Tech is encouraging students to convert to single rooms, moving out roommates over coming weeks to reduce exposure to the coronavirus. Both Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia announced they are renting more off-campus rooms to isolate or quarantine students who have been infected or exposed to the virus.  The University of Georgia reported 821 new infections for the week ended Saturday, a number that President Jere Morehead said Wednesday is “concerning.” He urged students to “continue to make every effort to prioritize their health and safety by taking the proper steps to avoid exposure to this virus.  Around 4% of all cases recorded in Georgia in the last month have been associated with university campuses, according to figures kept by The Associated Press. The number could be higher because some schools, including the state’s largest — Georgia State University — are not posting full reports publicly.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The rising campus infection numbers come as new cases in the rest of Georgia decline. The total number of cases rose to near 275,000 Wednesday, according to state data, but the average number of cases has fallen below 2,000 a day."

Chinese aviation authorities are allowing arrivals in Beijing under intense Covid-19 safety rules from Thailand, Cambodia, Pakistan, Greece, Denmark, Austria, Sweden and Canada -- countries deemed low-risk for cross-border infections.  Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed an Air China plane taxiing at the Beijing Capital International Airport after landing from the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.  Passengers disembarked wearing masks and dragging luggage -- some appeared to be in full protective suits -- before going past customs officials and police wearing visors and protective gear.  Travellers arriving in China need to show a negative coronavirus test before boarding, and are subject to centralised quarantine on arrival for 14 days, along with two more tests, officials said this week.  The number of passengers on direct international flights to Beijing is capped at 500 per day during a trial period, CCTV said.  Since late March, Beijing-bound international flights have been diverted to other Chinese cities, where passengers are screened for the coronavirus and quarantine.  Eleven cases were reported Thursday in China, where the coronavirus first emerged late last year. Health officials said they were all imported.  China remains wary of the risk of an influx of cases from other countries now that its local outbreaks have been largely brought under control.

(AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)  SYDNEY — Australian authorities have added 53 deaths at nursing homes from earlier this year to the country’s total of coronavirus deaths.  Those deaths plus six that officials reported Friday for the previous 24 hours raises Australia’s toll from the pandemic to 737.  Victoria state officials say the 53 earlier deaths were determined from reconciling numbers from July and August. An outbreak in the city of Melbourne has raced through dozens of aged-care homes, resulting in hundreds of deaths.  The outbreak in the state appears to be slowly waning, with Victoria officials reporting 81 new confirmed coronavirus cases Friday.  Victoria state chief health officer Brett Sutton says that “this is the stubborn tail of the epidemic curve.”  ___  ADVERTISEMENT  HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK  — Nevada church resumes court battle over COVID-19 rules  — White House faces skepticism over prospects for a vaccine  — Gov.

Authorities had earlier lifted a lockdown in Auckland following an outbreak there that began last month, but they continue to limit gathering sizes across the country and mandate that people wear masks on public transport.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Friday that “a cautious approach is the best long-term strategy to get our economy open and freedoms back faster in the long term.”  New Zealand reported five new virus cases Friday, two among returning travelers already in quarantine and three connected to the Auckland outbreak.  ___  SEOUL, South Korea —- The number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in South Korea has stayed below 200 for the second consecutive day amid toughened social distancing rules.  The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday it confirmed 198 additional cases in the latest 24-hour period, taking the country’s total to 20,842, with 331 deaths. About 70% of the new cases were in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.  South Korea has seen an uptick in infections since early last month, mostly linked to churches, restaurants, schools and fitness centers in the Seoul area. The daily case tally surpassed 400 in late August but has since showed a gradual downward trend.  Authorities in the Seoul area have recently restricted dining at restaurants and ordered the shutdown of churches, night establishments and after-school academics.  ___  RENO, Nev. -- Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak says he is pursuing the possibility of easing pandemic restrictions on religious gatherings as a rural church pushes forward with its legal effort to strike down the current 50-person cap as unconstitutional.  Lawyers for Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley filed new briefs in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday after the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly refused its bid in July for an emergency order suspending the hard cap.  Sisolak, who is Catholic, said Thursday he has asked his advisers to review whether the state can ease that restriction and allow churches to expand how many people can attend.  ___  RIO DE JANEIRO — The number of confirmed cornavirus cases in Brazil has risen above 4 million. Data the health ministry released Thursday evening also shows that the virus has caused nearly 125,000 deaths in Brazil since the pandemic began.  Both totals are the second highest for any country in the world, behind the United States, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.  Latin America’s largest nation has seen its daily number of new cases fall over the past six weeks, but it continues to report more than 35,000 per day. Its weekly COVID-19 death toll has also started to tip downward after a prolonged, elevated plateau.  ___  SANTA FE, N.M. -- Some grade schools in New Mexico will be allowed to have in-person learning next week, but it’s unclear how many are signing up.  The majority of counties in the state have low enough coronavirus case rates to allow for students to attend two days per week. But Public Education Department Secretary Ryan Stewart says the state will not mandate in-person learning during the coronavirus pandemic.  Many districts have decided to keep schools online-only through the end of September. Albuquerque Public Schools, the state’s largest district, has decided against nearly all in-person learning until January.  Stewart says the situation is fluid and some school boards could announce in-person learning plans for younger students as soon as Friday.  ___  NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is declining to say whether he would be vaccinated against the coronavirus when a vaccine becomes available.  The U.S. government has told public health departments to prepare to distribute vaccines as early as Nov. 1 and Lee said Thursday that Tennessee is working to develop a distribution plan.  But the governor also says being vaccinated is a personal choice. Lee says he will do what he wants all Tennesseans to do — to decide if the vaccine is “safe and effective” and to talk to their doctors.  ___  LANSING, Mich. — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says that gyms can reopen after 5 1/2 months of closure and that more organized sports can resume if face masks are worn. The move announced Thursday will lift some coronavirus restrictions that lasted longer in Michigan than in many other states.  The order takes effect next Wednesday and allows for the reopening of fitness centers and indoor pools in a swath of the state that is home to 93% of Michigan’s people. Face coverings will be required at all times inside gyms, including during exercise.  The governor also is allowing athletic competitions to resume in regions where they have been restricted. But her guidance recommends against sports involving more than fleeting contact, such as football, basketball, soccer, lacrosse and hockey.  ___  PHOENIX — Most counties in Arizona have been cleared to transition their schools to some form of in-person learning after improvements in coronavirus data.  The state Department of Health Services said Thursday that eight of Arizona’s 15 counties now meet the benchmarks required to do a hybrid of remote and in-person instruction if they choose to. In addition, two other mostly rural counties got the green light to switch to full-time, in-person classes.  For a county to offer hybrid instruction, it must have a decline in new cases or a rate of less than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in a two-week period, its test positivity rate must be below 7%, and its hospital visits for COVID-19-like illness be below 10%.  ___  CONCORD, N.H. — New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu thinks it’s unrealistic to believe a coronavirus vaccine will be available by Nov. 1 but says his state will be prepared to distribute it if it is.  Federal health officials last week instructed states to be ready to begin distribution by Nov. 1 — two days before elections. The timing raised suspicion among public health experts about whether the Trump administration intends to rush approval for political gain.  Sununu said Thursday that he disagreed with that suspicion and called the letter “a smart move.” He says it’s good to ensure everyone is ready just in case.  ___  ROME — Italian health experts have recommended that nursing homes and other residences where disabled and other ’’fragile” people live gradually allow visitors again with strict rules to guard against the spread of the coronavirus.  Deaths in residences for the elderly figured prominently in the heavy fatality toll of the first months of the pandemic in Italy, where the outbreak began in Europe.  The Superior Health Institute, which advises Italy’s public health system and Health Ministry, published guidelines on Thursday which recognized that meeting with loved ones is an integral part of the residents’ well-being. Still, the recommendations call for “avoiding handshakes, kisses and hugs” between residents and visitors in encounters, preferably held outdoors.  If residents are confined to a bed, then only one visitor should be allowed. If the guidelines are adopted by the government, new residents could be admitted, including from hospitals.  But they would need coronavirus tests and must stay in a separate part of the facility, away from the current residents, for 14 days.  ___  NORMAN, Okla. — More than a dozen University of Oklahoma students gathered outside the university’s administration building Thursday to protest what they say is an inadequate response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Student Kellie Dick, a senior from Shawnee, told The Associated Press that students are violating the university and the city of Norman’s mask mandates at bars, restaurants and fraternity and sorority functions.  In her words: “We really need people to wear their masks. I don’t want this to kill any more people than it already has.”  The protesting students presented a list of 12 demands that include online classes for most subjects, twice-weekly free coronavirus testing for the university’s students, faculty and staff, and the prohibition of social gatherings of more than 25 people.  The university’s chief COVID-19 official earlier Thursday told the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education that there have been no known transmissions of the virus in classrooms, but that the virus spread occurs in areas OU cannot control.  ___  MILWAUKEE — Milwaukee’s health commissioner is quitting to take a new job, citing the partisan battles management of the coronavirus.  Jeanette Kowalik is joining a national health policy think tank in Washington, D.C. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports Kowalik noted obstacles to testing, public health orders, mask messaging during the pandemic response.  Republican lawmakers brought a successful lawsuit before the state Supreme Court this spring ending Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ “safer at home” order designed to slow the spread of the virus. A conservative law firm has filed a lawsuit seeking to end the Evers mask mandate, which the Republican Senate majority leader has denounced.  Milwaukee has reported more than 17,700 positive cases and more than 275 deaths. Wisconsin has reported 1,142 deaths, according to the state Department of Health Services.  ___  PITTSBURGH — Federal agents searched two nursing homes Thursday near Pittsburgh, one of which had the worst coronavirus outbreak of any in Pennsylvania and was already being investigated by the state on suspicion of criminal neglect.  U.S. Attorney Scott Brady says agents were at the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County, as well as at the Mount Lebanon Rehabilitation and Wellness Center, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.  More than 330 of the for-profit Brighton nursing home’s residents tested positive for the virus since the end of March and at least 82 died, the newspaper reported.  A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office confirmed the office was involved in the warrant execution.  ___  MADRID — Spain on Thursday added nearly 9,000 new infections to a total of more than 488,500 since the start of the pandemic.  About 3,600 of the new cases were diagnosed in the past 24 hours, with the others in previous days but just reported.  The Madrid region, population 6.6 million, accounts for more than a third of the country’s new cases. About 16% of its hospital beds are currently devoted to treating COVID-19 patients, the highest rate in Spain.  With 40 new deaths recorded on Thursday, the total toll rose to 29,234. The figure doesn’t reflect those who have died without being tested for the virus.  ___  FURMAN, S.C. — A fraternity at a South Carolina university has been suspended for at least four years after it hosted a pair of parties that led to the spread of the coronavirus.  In a statement, Furman University says Kappa Alpha held parties at their fraternity house Aug. 21 and Aug. 22 and nearly 60% of those who attended -- at least 29 students -- tested positive for the coronavirus. Those who tested positive have been quarantined, the university says.  Meanwhile, Indiana University officials have requested all 40 fraternity and sorority houses at its Bloomington campus to shut down, saying their high rates of coronavirus infections made them unsafe. Testing at some houses found infection rates above 50 percent."

Dear Honorable Chairman Blumenauer & Honorable Members:  We write to convey our deep concern regarding proposed changes to the US Generalized System of Preferences program (GSP) which threaten to vitiate key provisions of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), the genuinely bipartisan measure that for the past 20 years has been the cornerstone of US economic engagement with the nations of Africa.  If adopted when GSP is renewed, as it needs to be by the end of the year, these changes would cause gratuitous hardship in a region already reeling from the impact of COVID-19. They would, furthermore, severely damage our nation’s standing in the continent as a strategic development and trade partner and would hand global competitors, China in particular, a massive free win.  In the name of GSP “modernization”, lobbyists for US apparel importers want Congress to extend to all GSP beneficiary countries duty-free tariff treatment that have, heretofore, been designated for eligible Agoa countries and a few of our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere such as Haiti in order to boost garment sectors in critical need of preferential trade concessions.  From its inception, GSP has specifically excluded preferential treatment for textiles and apparel. This has given US policy makers a powerful tool to advance US goals and interests by granting exceptions designed to help selected trading partners to attract investment in their textile and clothing sectors in order to fight destabilizing poverty and grow as markets for US goods and services.  Successive administrations, working with Congress, have used these exceptions to bolster the economies not just of Africa through Agoa but also of our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere through free trade agreements and unilaterally-extended preferences including the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement, and the Haiti HOPE/Help Act.  All these programs and agreements would be gutted by the so-called GSP “modernization” now being pushed by certain special interests. Put simply, preferences for all mean preferences for none.  If investors and margin-hungry sourcing managers see that GSP countries like Pakistan, Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines which already have a substantial share of the US clothing market at normal tariff rates are now to be eligible to access the US market duty-free, investment in and orders for African production will promptly be diverted to these countries. Even without duty-free treatment, each of these countries is already a supra-competitive apparel exporter. The biggest benefit resulting from GSP treatment for them would simply be a tax cut for the US apparel importers. For example, Indonesia apparel exports to the U.S. in 2019 totaled $4.9 billion[1] – triple the apparel exports of all 46 Sub-Saharan African countries combined valued at $1.4 billion[2]. African apparel is competitive only with the Agoa duty-free preference. If the same duty-free preference is extended to these super-competitive mega-producers, African apparel producers will be driven out of business.  The encouraging Agoa-stimulated trends we have seen in African supply capacity and exports to the US will be reversed, threatening to push millions back into poverty, the majority of them women, as the continent grapples with the human and economic toll of the novel coronavirus. And the damage will not be restricted to Africa. The pain will be felt by our hemispheric neighbors as well.  As members of the uniquely broad coalition that successfully championed Agoa and the historic paradigm shift it represented in US-Africa relations, we urgently request that any move that might extend Agoa’s apparel preferences to beneficiaries beyond those originally intended be strenuously resisted.

Once the services resume on September 15 all foreign passengers will be quarantined on arrival.  Around 5,000 people are expected to fly into Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City every week.  There will be two weekly round trips on the HCMC-Guangzhou (China) sector.  Vietnam Airlines or Pacific Airlines will operate one of them and a Chinese carrier, the other.  There will be two weekly services on the Hanoi-Tokyo and two HCMC-Tokyo routes, with Vietnam Airlines and Vietjet Air allocated one sector each.  On the South Korea route, Vietnam Airlines will fly to Seoul from Hanoi and Vietjet Air from HCMC, both once a week.  Vietnam Airlines is scheduled to fly on the HCMC-Taipei (Taiwan) sector, and Vietjet Air the Hanoi-Taipei route.  To Laos and Cambodia, aviation authorities have proposed one flight a week by Vietnam Airlines.  According to the CAAV proposal, passengers arriving in Vietnam must have been in these Asian destinations for at least 30 days prior to boarding the flight. Transit passengers will not be allowed in.  Passengers must furnish a certificate showing they tested negative for the novel coronavirus within three days before departure.  On arrival, they would undergo rapid testing for Covid-19 with the costs covered by the airlines. They will have to pay for their quarantine.  The CAAV has petitioned the Ministry of Health to announce quarantine requirements for passengers upon entry and publish a list of real-time PCR labs in the country for foreign passengers since they might need a Covid-19 testing certificate before leaving Vietnam.  Vietnam suspended all international flights on March 25. Many foreigners who have been kept out of Vietnam due to travel restrictions have pleaded with the government to reopen the borders and resume international flights so that they could reunite with their families.  China, Japan and South Korea are Vietnam's biggest foreign investors and also send the largest number of tourists to the country.  Vietnam has had 1,046 Covid-19 cases and 34 deaths so far."

In this study, we utilized duck embryo fibroblasts and domestic ducklings as in vitro and in vivo models of a JEV amplifying avian host to identify the viral determinants of the differing replication efficiency between the GI and GIII strains in birds. GI strains induced significantly lower levels of interferon (IFN)-α and β production than GIII strains, an effect orrelated with the enhanced replication efficiency of GI strains over GIII strains. By using a series of chimeric viruses with exchange of viral structural and non-structural (NS) proteins, we identified NS5 as the viral determinant of the differences in IFN-α and β induction and replication efficiency between the GI and III strains. NS5 inhibited IFN-α and β production induced by poly(I:C) stimulation and harbored 11 amino acid variations, of which the NS5-V372A and NS5-H386Y variations were identified to co-contribute to the differences in IFN-α and β induction and replication efficiency between the strains. The NS5-V372A and NS5-H386Y variations resulted in alterations in the number of hydrogen bonds formed with neighboring residues, which were associated with the different ability of the GI and GIII strains to inhibit IFN-α and β production. Our findings indicated that the NS5-V372A and NS5-H386Y variations enabled GI strains to inhibit IFN-α and β production more efficiently than GIII strains for antagonism of the IFN-I mediated antiviral response, thereby leading to the replication and host adaption advantages of GI strains over GIII strains in birds. These findings provide new insight into the molecular basis of the JEV genotype shift.  The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission cycle is maintained by mosquitoes and amplification hosts (pigs and birds). In areas without large pig populations, birds play a major role in the maintenance of the JEV transmission cycle. The shift in the dominant JEV genotype from genotype III (GIII) to genotype I (GI) is occurring in most countries in Asia. GI strains replicates more efficiently than GIII strains in birds, and this difference has been considered one of the reasons for the JEV genotype shift. By using a series of chimeric viruses with exchange of viral structural and non-structural (NS) proteins, we demonstrated that NS5 is the viral determinant of the differences in replication efficiencies between the GI and III strains in birds. Furthermore, the NS5-V372A and NS5-H386Y variations were identified to co-contribute to the differences in type I interferon (IFN-I) induction and replication efficiency between the strains. Our findings suggested that the NS5-V372A and NS5-H386Y variations enable GI strains to inhibit IFN-I production more efficiently than GIII strains, thus resulting in antagonism of the IFN-I mediated antiviral response and consequently conferring a replication and host adaption advantage to GI strains over GIII strains in birds. These findings provide new insight into the molecular basis of the JEV genotype shift.

The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript  Type I interferon (IFN-I) serves as the first line host defense against flavivirus infection[ 24 ]. The ability to antagonize the IFN-I mediated antiviral response is a limiting factor associated with the replication efficiency and host adaptability of flavivirus[ 13 , 14 ], thereby determining the species range of viral hosts[ 25 ]. For example, ZIKV antagonizes interferon-β (IFN-β) induction via an evolutionary NS1 mutation, thereby promoting replication efficiency in mosquitoes and enhancing neurovirulence in mammals[ 26 ]. A single amino acid substitution in NS4B of DENV enhances virus growth and fitness in human cells in vitro through an IFN-dependent host response[ 27 ]. For JEV, the replication efficiency and virulence positively correlate with the ability to inhibit the IFN-I mediated antiviral response[ 28 ]. GI strains replicate more efficiently than GIII strains in IFN-competent chicken-derived DF-1 cells but not in IFN-deficient Vero cells[ 22 ], thus implying that the ability to antagonize the IFN-I mediated antiviral response may determine the differences in replication efficiency between the GI and GIII strains in birds. In this study, we examined the differences in IFN-I induction between these strains by using duck embryo fibroblasts (DEF) and domestic ducklings as in vitro and in vivo avian models, respectively, and identified the viral determinant of the differences in replication efficiency between these strains in birds.  JEV is a mosquito-borne virus with a zoonotic transmission cycle maintained by mosquito vectors and vertebrate amplifying hosts (birds and pigs)[ 15 ]. As amplifying hosts of JEV, infected birds and pigs develop a sufficiently high viremia to infect mosquitoes, thereby playing a critical role in the maintenance and transmission of the JEV in nature[ 1 , 16 , 17 ]. Although pigs are essential for JEV amplification, some epidemics occur in areas with low pig populations[ 18 , 19 ]. Moreover, the JEV genotype shift has occurred in some endemic countries where pig-breeding is not common, such as Korea[ 18 ], Malaysia[ 20 ], and India[ 21 ]. These observations suggest an essential contribution of birds to the maintenance and transmission of the JEV as well as the JEV genotype shift. Indeed, GI strains have been demonstrated to replicate more efficiently than GIII strains in domestic ducklings and young chickens, thus showing an advantage of GI strains over GIII strains in replication efficiency and host adaption in birds, and contributing to the JEV genotype shift [ 22 , 23 ]. The mechanisms underlying this advantage are not known. A resent publication has demonstrated that three amino acid substitutions in NS2B/NS3 contribute to the replication advantage of GI strains over GIII strains in pigs and poultry[ 22 ], thus providing insight into the molecular basis of the JEV genotype shift. However, this molecular basis still remains largely unknown.  The JEV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA approximately 11 kb in length that encodes a single polyprotein. After translation, the polyprotein is cleaved by both host and viral proteases into three structural proteins (capsid I, pre-membrane/membrane (prM), and envelopeI) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5)[ 8 ]. According to the nucleotide sequence of the E gene, JEV is phylogenetically classified into five genotypes (genotype I to V), and most isolates belong to genotype I (GI) or genotype III (GIII)[ 9 ]. GIII was the dominant genotype from 1935 through the end of the 20 th century throughout most countries in Asia[ 10 , 11 ]. GI was first identified in Cambodia in 1967 and then remained undetectable until a new strain re-emerged in China in 1979[ 12 , 13 ]. Notably, the number of GI isolates has increased in the past 20 years, thus resulting in a JEV genotype shift from GIII to GI; the re-emergent GI has become the dominant genotype instead of GIII in most countries in Asia[ 14 ].  Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae, which comprises more than 70 species—including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus—and causes Japanese encephalitis in humans and reproductive disorders in pigs[ 1 , 2 ]. The annual incidence of human cases caused by JEV has been reported to be in the range of 30,000 to 50,000, with approximately 10,000 to 15,000 fatalities[ 3 ]. JEV was first isolated in Japan in 1935 and is currently prevalent mainly in East and Southeast Asia[ 3 – 5 ]. To date, JEV is considered to extend to new geographic regions, thus posing a risk to public health worldwide[ 6 , 7 ].  Results  IFN-α and β determine the differences in replication efficiency between the GI and GIII strains in DEF The replication efficiency of GI and GIII strains was associated with the levels of IFN-α and β production (Fig 1), we therefore examined whether IFN-α and β determined the differences in replication efficiency between the GI and GIII strains in DEF. To this end, we chose the SH7 and SH15 strains as representative GI and GIII viruses, respectively, and constructed an infectious cDNA clone of each (denoted rGI for SH7 and rGIII for SH15) that was used as backbone for generation of chimeric recombinant viruses in subsequent experiments. Analysis of the replication kinetics in DEF revealed that rGI and rGIII exhibited virus titers similar to those of SH7 and SH15, respectively (Fig 2A).

(D to F) DEF were treated with siRNA for silencing IFN-α or β expression (siRNA+), or with scrambled RNA control (siRNA-) and incubated for 12 h.

DEF were inoculated with rGI, UV-inactivated-rGI (UV-rGI), rGIII, and UV-inactivated rGIII (UV-rGIII), and the levels of IFN-α and β expression were measured by qRT-PCR. In contrast to the cells infected with rGI and rGIII, no NS5 protein was detected in the cells infected with UV-rGI or UV-rGIII (Fig 2B), indicating that both UV-rGI and UV-rGIII were inactivated and unable to replicate in DEF. Analysis of IFN-α and β expression indicated that rGI and rGIII induced both IFN-α and β expression, with significant differences in the mRNA levels between rGI and rGIII. However, UV-rGI and UV-rGIII failed to induce IFN-α and β expression (Fig 2C). The levels of IFN-α and β expression in the cells infected with UV-rGI and UV-rGIII were similar to the basal levels of IFN-α and β expression in mock-infected cells. These results indicated that viral replication was essential for IFN-α and β induction. To test whether IFN-α and β determined the differences in replication efficiency between the GI and GIII strains, DEF was treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down IFN-α and β expression by RNA interference and subsequently infected with rGI and rGIII. In response to rGI and rGIII infection, the levels of IFN-α and β induction increased at the mRNA and protein levels in the cells treated with siRNA (siRNA+), as compared with mock-infected cells, but were significantly lower than those in the cells treated with scrambled RNA control (siRNA-) (Fig 2D and 2E), suggesting that IFN-α and β expression was silenced. Noticeably, no significant differences in IFN-α and β induction between rGI and rGIII were observed in the cells treated with siRNA (siRNA+) in the presence of rGI and rGIII infection (Fig 2D and 2E). Analysis of viral replication indicated that significant increases in replication titers of rGI and rGIII were observed in the cells treated with siRNA (siRNA+), as compared with the cells treated with scrambled RNA control (siRNA-) (Fig 2F). However, no significant differences in virus titers between rGI and rGIII were detected in the cells treated with siRNA (siRNA+) (Fig 2F). Overall, these observations demonstrated that JEV replication was essential for IFN-α and β induction, and IFN-α and β determined the differences in replication efficiency between the GI and GIII strains in DEF.  Amino acid variations between the GI and GIII strains Mutations in amino acid sequences alter the ability of flavivirus to induce of IFN-I production[26, 28]. To determine the viral determinants of the differences in IFN-α and β induction, we compared the amino acid sequences between the GI and GIII strains. A total of 50 representative GI and GIII strains, including the strains used in this study (S1 Table), were downloaded from the GenBank database and subjected to phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment. The sequence alignment revealed a total of 43 amino acid variations with high conservation rates of 90%–100% and ten amino acid variations with relatively low conservation rates of 50%–89% in their respective genotypes between the GI and GIII strains (Table 1 and S3 Fig). The amino acid variations were distributed in three structural proteins (C, PrM, and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (Table 1). Notably, some non-structural proteins with relatively high numbers of amino acid variations, such as NS1, NS3, and NS5, have been demonstrated to be involved in antagonizing the IFN-I mediated antiviral response in flavivirus[33–36].

Amino acid variations conserved between GI and GIII strains. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008773.t001  A region harboring two amino acid variations at position 372 and 386 of NS5 is responsible for the differences in IFN-α and β induction and replication efficiency between the GI and GIII strains in DEF A total of 11 amino acid variations between the GI and GIII strains were distributed in NS5 (Fig 6A and Table 1), the largest viral protein consisting of an N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase), an N-terminal extension (N-ext), and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain[37]. To identify the amino acid variation(s) responsible for the differences in IFN-α and β induction between the GI and GIII strains, we generated a series of chimeric recombinant viruses (rGI/SH15MTase, rGI/SH15N-ext, rGI/SH15RdRp, rGIII/SH7MTase, rGIII/SH7N-ext, and rGIII/SH7RdRp) with exchange of the three domains between the GI and GIII strains (Fig 6A), which were tested for changes in IFN-α and β induction in DEF. All chimeric recombinant viruses excluding rGI/SH15RdRp and rGIII/SH7RdRp induced similar levels of IFN-α and β expression to those induced by the parental viruses (Figs 6A and S5A), thus suggesting that RdRp, but not MTase and N-ext, had a significant role in determining the differences in IFN-α and β induction between the strains.

(B, C and D) DEF were infected with the indicated chimeric viruses at 0.01 MOI and collected at the indicated time points for analysis of replication efficiency. The replication titers in the supernatants were titrated with TCID 50 assays in BHK cells (B). The viral RNA copies and NS5 levels in the cells were examined with TaqMan probe-based qRT-PCR (C) and western blotting with anti-NS5 antibodies (D), respectively. All data are presented as mean ± SD from three independent experiments and were tested by Student’s t-test. The significant difference between rGI/SH15a-aRdRp and rGI/SH15b-aRdRp at different time points is marked (*, p < 0.05; **, p <0.01). The significant difference between rGIII/SH7a-aRdRp and rGIII/SH7b-aRdRp at different time points is labeled (&, p < 0.05; &&, p < 0.01). (E and F) Monolayers of DEF were infected with the indicated chimeric viruses at 100 PFU for analysis of plaque morphology. The plaques were stained with crystal violet at 4 dpi (E) and the plaque diameters were measured and plotted (F). The significant differences between groups were tested by Student’s t-test (***, p < 0.001). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008773.g006 Chimeric rGI/SH15RdRp with a substitution of SH15 RdRp on the rGI backbone induced higher levels of IFN-α and β expression than those induced by the parental rGI. In contrast, the chimeric rGIII/SH7RdRp with the substitution of SH7 RdRp on the rGIII backbone showed lower levels of IFN-α and β expression than those induced by the parental rGIII (Figs 6A and S5A), thus suggesting that the RdRp domain was responsible for the differences in IFN-α and β induction between the strains. There were seven amino acid variations present in the RdRp domain between the GI and GIII strains (Fig 6A). To narrow the region of the RdRp domain responsible for the differences in IFN-α and β induction, we further divided the RdRp domain into two parts: aRdRp, containing five amino acid variations, and bRdRp, containing two amino acid variations. We then generated four chimeric recombinant viruses (rGI/SH15aRdRp, rGI/SH15bRdRp, rGIII/SH7aRdRp, and rGIII/SH7bRdRp) by exchange of aRdRp and bRdRp between the GI and GIII strains (Fig 6A). The effects of these chimeric viruses on IFN-α and β induction were tested in DEF. As shown in Figs 6A and S5B, the chimeric rGI/SH15aRdRp and rGIII/SH7aRdRp induced different levels of IFN-α and β expression from those induced by parental rGI and rGIII, respectively, thus suggesting that the aRdRp region was responsible for the differences in IFN-α and β induction between the strains. The aRdRp region was further divided into two parts: a-aRdRp, containing two amino acid variations, and b-aRdRp, including three amino acid variations. These were then used to generate four chimeric recombinant viruses (rGI/SH15a-aRdRp, rGI/SH15b-aRdRp, rGIII/SH7a-aRdRp, and rGIII/SH7b-aRdRp) by exchange of a-aRdRp and b-aRdRp between the GI and GIII strains (Fig 6A). The effects of these chimeric viruses on IFN-α and β induction were tested in DEF. As shown in Figs 6A and S5C, the levels of IFN-α and β expression induced by rGI/SH15a-aRdRp and rGIII/SH7a-aRdRp significantly differed from those induced by parental rGI and rGIII, respectively, thus indicating that the a-aRdRp region containing two amino acid variations at positions 372 and 386 was responsible for the differences in IFN-α and β induction between the strains. To test whether the differences in IFN-α and β induction resulted in the differences in replication efficiency, we examined the replication titers of chimeric viruses with exchange of NS5 domains or aRdRp and bRdRp between the GI and GIII strains (Fig 6A) in DEF. All chimeric viruses excluding the chimeric virus rGI/SH15RdRp, rGIII/SH7RdRp, rGI/SH15aRdRp and rGIII/SH7aRdRp showed replication titers (S5D Fig) and plaque sizes (S5E Fig) similar to those of the parental recombinant viruses, thus suggesting that NS5 aRdRp region that was responsible for the differences in IFN-α and β induction had a significant role in determining the differences in replication efficiency between the strains. Analysis of replication titers of the chimeric virus rGI/SH15a-aRdRp, rGI/SH15b-aRdRp, rGIII/SH7a-aRdRp, and rGIII/SH7b-aRdRp in DEF reveled that the viral titers of rGI/SH15b-aRdRp and rGIII/SH7a-aRdRp containing the a-aRdRp region of GI strains were markedly higher than those of rGI/SH15a-aRdRp and rGIII/SH7b-aRdRp harboring the a-aRdRp region of GIII strains (Fig 6B). Additionally, the viral RNA copies (Fig 6C) and NS5 levels (Fig 6D) of rGI/SH15b-aRdRp and rGIII/SH7a-aRdRp were noticeably higher than those of rGI/SH15a-aRdRp and rGIII/SH7b-aRdRp. Analysis of plaque sizes showed that the plaque sizes of rGI/SH15b-aRdRp and rGIII/SH7a-aRdRp were clearly larger than those of rGI/SH15a-aRdRp and rGIII/SH7b-aRdRp (Fig 6E and 6F). These differences were not observed in BHK cells, and the replication titers (S6A Fig) and plaque sizes (S6B Fig) were similar among the chimeric recombinant virus rGI/SH15b-aRdRp, rGIII/SH7a-aRdRp, rGI/SH15a-aRdRp and rGIII/SH7b-aRdRp. Together, these data indicated that the a-aRdRp region harboring two amino acid variations at position 372 and 386 of NS5 was responsible for the differences in IFN-α and β induction, thereby resulting in the differences in replication efficiency between the strains in DEF.  The number of hydrogen bonds formed by NS5-372 and NS5-386 contributes to the differences in IFN-α and β induction and replication efficiency between the GI and GIII strains in DEF Structurally, NS5-372 and NS5-386 were located in the α-helix of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) region, which is involved in interaction with importins, antagonism of IFN-I production, and viral replication[36, 38]. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of NS5 revealed a difference in the number of hydrogen bonds formed by NS5-372 and NS5-386 with their neighboring residues between the GI and GIII strains. NS5-372 of the GI strains formed one hydrogen bond with residues 369 and 375, whereas NS5-386 formed one hydrogen bond with residue 382. Interestingly, NS5-372 of the GIII strains formed one hydrogen bond with residues 369, 375, and 376, whereas NS5-386 formed one hydrogen bond with residues 382 and 383 (Fig 9A, yellow arrow indicates the hydrogen bond). This analysis indicated that NS5-372 and NS5-386 of GI strains formed fewer hydrogen bonds with their neighboring residues than GIII strains, thus potentially resulting in a higher flexibility of the NS5 NLS region in GI relative to GIII.

To explore whether the number of hydrogen bonds formed by NS5-372 and NS5-386 contributed to the differences in IFN-α and β induction and replication efficiency between the GI and GIII strains, we first analyzed the number of hydrogen bonds formed by different amino acids at NS5-372 and NS5-386 (S2 Table). On the basis of the number of hydrogen bonds and the properties of amino acids, Gly, Pro, Ile, and Leu belong to the same nonpolar group as Val and Ala and were therefore selected for replacement of Val or Ala at NS5-372, and Lys and Arg from the same polar basic group including His were selected for replacement of His or Tyr at NS5-386 (Table 3). Four substitution mutants, rGI/V372G-H386K, rGI/V372P-H386R, rGI/V372I-H386Y, and rGI/V372L-H386Y, were generated on the rGI backbone by replacement of Val with Gly, Pro, Ile, or Leu at NS5-372, and of His with Lys, Arg, or Tyr at NS5-386. Four substitution mutants, rGIII/A372I, rGIII/A372L, rGIII/A372G-Y386K, and rGIII/A372P-Y386R, were constructed on the basis of the rGIII backbone by replacement of Ala with Ile, Leu, Gly, or Pro at NS5-372, and of Tyr with Lys or Arg at NS5-386.

The rGI/V372G-H386K, rGI/V372P-H386R, rGIII/A372G-Y386K, and rGIII/A372P-Y386R with one/two hydrogen bonds at NS5-372 and one hydrogen bond at NS5-386 induced levels of IFN-α and β expression similar to those induced by rGI but were significantly lower than those induced by rGIII as well as rGI/V372I-H386Y, rGI/V372L-H386Y, rGIII/A372I, and rGIII/A372L with three hydrogen bonds at NS5-372 and two hydrogen bonds at NS5-386 (Fig 9B). In contrast, the levels of IFN-α and β expression induced by rGI/V372I-H386Y, rGI/V372L-H386Y, rGIII/A372I, and rGIII/A372L were similar to those induced by rGIII but were markedly higher than those induced by rGI as well as rGI/V372G-H386K, rGI/V372P-H386R, rGIII/A372G-Y386K, and rGIII/A372P-Y386R (Fig 9B). These data suggested that the number of hydrogen bonds formed by NS5-372 and NS5-386 contributed to the differences in IFN-α and β induction between the strains, and GI strains with two hydrogen bonds at NS5-372 and one hydrogen bond at NS5-386 induced lower levels of IFN-α and β expression than GIII strains with three hydrogen bonds at NS5-372 and two hydrogen bonds at NS5-386. Because the number of hydrogen bonds formed by NS5-372 and NS5-386 contributed to the differences in IFN-α and β induction, we examined the effects of the number of hydrogen bonds formed by NS5-372 and NS5-386 on viral replication. DEF were infected with these substitution mutant viruses, and the replication kinetics was measured. The replication titers of rGI/V372G-H386K, rGI/V372P-H386R, rGIII/A372G-Y386K, and rGIII/A372P-Y386R were similar to those of rGI but were significantly higher than those of rGIII as well as rGI/V372I-H386Y, rGI/V372L-H386Y, rGIII/A372I, and rGIII/A372L from 36 to 84 hpi (Fig 9C). In contrast, rGI/V372I-H386Y, rGI/V372L-H386Y, rGIII/A372I, and rGIII/A372L produced viral titers similar to those of rGIII, but were markedly lower than those of rGI as well as rGI/V372G-H386K, rGI/V372P-H386R, rGIII/A372G-Y386K, and rGIII/A372P-Y386R from 36 to 84 hpi (Fig 9C). Additionally, the plaque sizes formed by rGI/V372G-H386K, rGI/V372P-H386R, rGIII/A372G-Y386K, and rGIII/A372P-Y386R were similar to those formed by rGI but clearly larger than those formed by rGIII as well as rGI/V372I-H386Y, rGI/V372L-H386Y, rGIII/A372I, and rGIII/A372L (Fig 9D and 9E). The plaque sizes (S6E Fig) and replication titers (S6F Fig) of all the substitution mutant viruses were tested in BHK cells, and no significant differences were observed. These data suggested that the number of hydrogen bonds formed by NS5-372 and NS5-386 contributed to the differences in replication efficiency between the GI and GIII strains in DEF, and GI strains with two hydrogen bonds at NS5-372 and one hydrogen bond at NS5-386 replicated more efficiently than GIII strains with three hydrogen bonds at NS5-372 and two hydrogen bonds at NS5-386."

The country is and will remain a European—rather than an Asian—power by virtue of its history, strategic culture, demographics, and principal economic relationships.  Russia’s Partnership with China  The Asia-Pacific will remain important for Russia’s foreign policy primarily because of its growing strategic partnership with China, a rapprochement that began not in 2014 but in 1989. Moscow’s other economic, military, security, and diplomatic interests in the region are of much less importance, and it will subordinate these interests to the overriding priority of maintaining and strengthening its critical geopolitical relationship with Beijing.  Eugene Rumer Rumer, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, is a senior fellow and the director of Carnegie’s Russia and Eurasia Program. More >  The evolution of Russia’s military posture in the Far East and its military capabilities in the Eastern Military District (MD) mirror the country’s relatively modest interests and position in the region and the district’s low prioritization compared with others west of the Urals. The size of the forces assigned to the Eastern MD has remained largely static; the scope and scale of their qualitative improvements have been modest; and they are postured mainly for strategic deterrence, domination of the airspace and seas around the disputed Kuril Islands, and defense of the land border with China. Although there has been a modest increase in its long-distance force-projection capabilities, Russia lacks the assets and infrastructure to sustain high-intensity conventional operations at long ranges in the region, and its forces are no match for U.S. air and naval forces, especially if combined with those of regional U.S. allies and partners. The presence of the Russian Navy in the Western Pacific remains quite modest as well.  The Rest of Asia  Russia’s relationships with other Asian countries take a back seat to Moscow’s strategic partnership with Beijing.  Russia’s relations with Japan: Russia’s other critical relationship in the Asia-Pacific is with Japan. The most important feature of this relationship, however, is its unrealized potential, which underscores Moscow’s heavy tilt toward China. Russia’s trade, investment, and economic relations with Japan remain underdeveloped, and any significant improvement in political ties are hostage to the two countries’ unresolved territorial dispute over the Kuril Islands, the Russian-Chinese strategic partnership, and Japan’s alliance with the United States. The record of the Russian-Japanese relationship since the end of the Cold War is one of false starts, dashed hopes, and unrealistic expectations. The prospects for a breakthrough will remain bleak for the indefinite future.  Russia’s marginal role on the Korean Peninsula: Russia’s aspirations for a more significant role on the Korean Peninsula remain unfulfilled. Its relationship with North Korea involves mostly muddling through. Trade and investment links remain weak. Russia has been completely shut out of U.S.–North Korea diplomatic talks on denuclearization. Ties with South Korea have not fared much better: Seoul sees little benefit in forging closer relations with Moscow because only Beijing has the leverage to influence North Korean behavior. Russia generally follows China’s lead on the Korean Peninsula primarily because North Korea is not a high priority. Because the region is of far less importance to Russia than it is to China, which possesses far more leverage over Pyongyang, Moscow is unlikely to allow any daylight to develop between their positions on North Korea.  Richard Sokolsky Richard Sokolsky is a nonresident senior fellow in Carnegie’s Russia and Eurasia Program. His work focuses on U.S. policy toward Russia in the wake of the Ukraine crisis.  Russia’s limited ties to Southeast Asia: Moscow’s more active engagement since the 2016 Russian summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as outreach to individual Southeast Asian countries, has yielded meager results. It has had some success in expanding arms sales, trade, and energy cooperation with several members of ASEAN, but its relations with the organization itself are largely devoid of substance. Bilateral ties with its most important partners in the region—Vietnam, Indonesia, and Myanmar—have yet to reach their full potential.  Several factors explain why Russia punches below its weight in Southeast Asia: it is not a high priority for Russian foreign policy because Moscow has limited interests there, neither Russia nor ASEAN need each other that much, and Russia has prioritized its strategic partnership with China over expanding its influence in the region. As on the Korean Peninsula, Moscow has acknowledged Beijing’s sphere of influence in the region, relegating itself to the role of a de facto junior partner. Russia therefore should not be seen as a truly independent actor in Southeast Asia.  Implications for U.S. Policy in the Asia-Pacific  Russia’s top priorities in the Asia-Pacific lie outside the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia, and it does not have much to offer when it comes to either. In both cases, Russia is content to serve as China’s de facto junior partner and has tacitly accepted Chinese spheres of influence. Thus, all roads to gaining Moscow’s support for or acquiescence to U.S. policies toward these regions run through Beijing.  China: The blossoming strategic partnership between Russia and China has raised concerns in the U.S. strategic community that it poses a grave threat to U.S. interests. Some analysts and officials seem to believe that a wedge strategy could weaken or break up their alignment. This is magical thinking: their partnership is rooted in the confluence of their domestic political, economic, and geopolitical interests; priorities; and threat perceptions. Equally important, Russia and China consider the United States their primary challenge, and it would take a fundamental revision of U.S. policy to change that perception. Good relations with Beijing are a strategic necessity for Moscow, and its leaders see no alternative to the partnership. Russia is a marginal actor in the geopolitics of the Asia-Pacific and thus is largely inconsequential to the regional competition between the United States and China. The main task for the United States is to develop a viable strategy tailored for its relations with both China and Russia.  The Korean Peninsula: Russia will pursue its goals on the Korean Peninsula in lockstep with China. Because it shares the United States’ interest in denuclearizing North Korea, Moscow can be part of the solution rather than part of the problem if Washington is willing to show flexibility on the pace and scope of denuclearization and sanctions; alternatively, the Kremlin can be a spoiler, making it more difficult for Washington to achieve its preferred outcomes. Russia can be counted on to restrain belligerent North Korean behavior that risks a large-scale war on the peninsula and precipitates additional U.S. military deployments that it would find threatening. Should Moscow and Washington ever resume a high-level strategic dialogue, preventing the further growth of North Korean nuclear capabilities should be a high priority on the agenda. The U.S. strategy for dealing with Russia’s approach to the Korean Peninsula should be one of co-optation rather than isolation.  Southeast Asia: Russia is likely to be of little geopolitical value to the United States in its efforts to balance against China in Southeast Asia, especially in the South China Sea. Moscow’s main priority in the region is to avoid antagonizing China. Thus, any attempt by the United States to drive a wedge between the two countries over Southeast Asia is doomed to fail and would only further aggravate tensions in the U.S.-China relationship. In waging its great-power competition with Moscow, Washington does not need to be overly concerned about countering every move the latter makes to develop improved military and security cooperation with members of ASEAN because the U.S. military enjoys conventional superiority over Russian forces in the region.  The geopolitical geometry of great-power competition in the Asia-Pacific will not be triangular. China and the United States will be the main players in the contest for regional supremacy. Russia will be an interested but not terribly influential bystander—ready to take opportunistic advantage of openings created by U.S. mistakes and miscues. This does not mean that Washington should or can ignore Moscow. But it does mean that U.S. leaders, experts, analysts, and politicians should not obsess about Russia stealing a march on the United States and eroding its influence in the region.  Introduction  Much has been written about Russia’s pivot to the Asia-Pacific, especially in the aftermath of Moscow’s break with the West caused by its 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and undeclared war against Ukraine.1 Most of this body of writing has been infused with a great deal of skepticism about the quality and durability of that geopolitical shift, considering Russia’s economic weakness relative to the dynamism and growing importance the region has come to play in world trade, technological development, and, increasingly, geopolitics.2 The conventional wisdom on the pivot has concluded—with a few notable dissenting voices—that the shift is essentially a declaratory gesture with little substance, motivated less by Russia’s growing interests in Asia than by its break in relations with Europe and the deterioration of the U.S.-Russian relationship.  Aleksandar Vladicic Aleksandar Vladicic was a James C. Gaither Junior Fellow with the Russia and Eurasia Program. More >  The conventional wisdom is right: Russia is and will remain a European—rather than an Asian—power by virtue of its history, strategic culture, demographics, and principal economic relationships. The Asia-Pacific will remain important for Russia’s foreign policy, but almost exclusively as a function of two factors. First, there is the long-shared border with China and the complexity of the relationship with this neighbor and the great and growing strategic imbalance it involves. Second, there is the strategic competition with the United States, which—in the eyes of Kremlin decisionmakers—poses an existential threat to the Russian state. Both relationships are fraught with major challenges for Russia, but of the two, Moscow has chosen to see the one with China as the lesser threat. Other relationships in the Asia-Pacific—with the two Koreas, Southeast Asia, and even Japan—are of less importance for Russia and largely derivative of its relationships with China and the United States. The latter two are relationships of necessity, while the others are a matter of choice.  The first part of this paper considers Russia’s Asia policy and the Asian pivot in the overall context of its foreign policy and its principal drivers, historically and post-1991. It then examines Russia’s would-be détente with Japan that could be construed as an attempt at geopolitical balancing. The next sections examine Russia’s role on the Korean Peninsula and relations with Southeast Asia. The paper concludes with an assessment of the implications of Russia’s pivot for U.S. interests and policy recommendations.  A European Power, Not an Asian One  To be properly understood, Russia’s Asia policy and its peculiar, lopsided quality need to be considered in the context of the country’s foreign policy overall and beyond the complementary nature of the Russian and Chinese economies and political systems.  Much has been written about the legacy of the Mongol invasion and its impact on the development of the Russian state, particularly in terms of the fear of what the late-nineteenth-century philosopher Vladimir Solovyov described as the “yellow peril” and deep-seated concerns about Russia’s decline at a time in its history when it is facing again a far more powerful civilization in the East.3 The legacy of the invasion is complex and multifaceted: the depiction of Mongols as brutal, ruthless invaders in Russian art has been counterbalanced by the emergence of Eurasianism as a prominent intellectual current in post-Soviet Russia, as well as by official statements comparing the influence of the Mongols favorably to European attitudes toward Russia.4  However, it is Europe, rather than Asia, that has been the chief preoccupation of Russian foreign policy for over 400 years. Notwithstanding the importance of that historical legacy and its enormous geographic footprint—over 70 percent of its territory—in Asia, Russia fundamentally is a European country, and its foreign policy and national security priorities are Eurocentric.5 Some three-quarters of its people live in Europe, and the population of its vast Asian territory is declining.6 Russia is, at best, a marginal and relatively new and inexperienced actor in the Asia-Pacific; culturally, politically, historically, and strategically, it is bound to remain a European, rather than an Asian or Eurasian, power. To further illustrate this point, more recently, Russia chose to close the border with China at the end of January due to fears about the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revealingly, the Kremlin did not close its borders to travelers from Europe, where most of the infections came from, until the middle of March. Evidently, the authorities considered Europe, despite its large number of infections and slow response to the pandemic, much less of a threat than China.  Since the emergence of the modern Russian state and the rise of the Romanov dynasty, the country’s principal foreign policy concerns have been in the European theater. After the turn of the seventeenth century, Russia waged a seemingly endless chain of wars with a succession of major European powers—Poland, Sweden, Turkey, France, the United Kingdom (UK), Austria, and Germany. Its two greatest wars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries—against Napoleon’s France and Hitler’s Germany—are essential to Russia’s national narrative. After suffering tremendous losses and coming perilously close to crushing defeats, Russia emerged from both conflicts victorious and with its position as a great European power greatly enhanced. The narrative of the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II has become the key element of the official Russian national narrative of the Putin era. Tellingly, the campaign against Japan launched in August 1945 is largely bypassed in that narrative. The Soviet Union’s contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany, according to the Kremlin, entitles Russia to a special role in the affairs of Europe and the world. 7 No such claim with respect to Asia has ever been made.  Russia’s push into Asia with the conquest of Siberia and the expansion of the empire to the Pacific gets relatively little attention in the country’s national narrative. It is treated largely as a sideshow undertaken by small bands of enterprising adventurers as opposed to the push into Europe, a task which engaged all instruments of national power.8 Siberia was the distant frontier, the place of exile for criminals, and the unexplored, uncivilized part of the empire. Russia’s expansion into Central Asia in the nineteenth century is usually treated as a secondary theater, an extension of the competition with the UK—often called the Great Game.  Historically, the Russian terms for “Asia” and “Asians” were associated with perceptions of inferior culture and civilization, so the terms were often used derogatorily, whereas Europe was considered the land of superior culture and civilization for Russia to join and emulate.9 The ruling classes of the empire intermarried with European aristocracy, and the Romanov dynasty was for generations part of the vast pan-European extended royal family. Tsar Nicholas II, the last Romanov ruler, and the UK’s King George V were first cousins.  During the Cold War, the Soviet Union’s foreign policy efforts were concentrated in Europe, where the military standoff between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact constituted the bloc’s principal national security concern. The Cold War’s other theaters—the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America—were derivative of the competition with the United States and its European allies. The decade-long invasion and occupation of Afghanistan starting in 1979 was also a byproduct of the Soviet Union’s confrontation with the West, principally the United States, but also Western Europe.  Nonetheless, the tense relationship with China during much of the Cold War was undoubtedly one of the Soviet Union’s top foreign policy and national security concerns, consuming vast military and economic resources. But, even though it resulted in military clashes along their border, the rivalry with China never reached the scale and intensity of the competition with the United States; nor was Beijing viewed as the same existential threat represented by the United States and its NATO allies.10 As the United States and China moved to normalize relations in the 1970s, the Sino-Soviet rivalry acquired an additional dimension, and the standoff with China turned into yet another theater for the Soviet Union in the Cold War with the West.  Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific, the Soviet Union’s reach was limited, with North Korea and Vietnam as its only client states. However, those relationships, too, were byproducts of the Soviet-U.S. Cold War rivalry. Other major regional actors—Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia—were firmly in the U.S. sphere of influence.  The end of the Cold War resulted in relatively few changes in the geographic priorities of Russia’s foreign policy. The normalization of relations with China was a major breakthrough that relieved the country of the burden of having to secure the vast and heavily militarized border, but Moscow’s relationships with the West remained by far the most important element of its foreign policy. The West had emerged dominant from the Cold War, and throughout the early post-Soviet period, Russian domestic reforms—economic and political—had the stated objective of making the country more like Western democratic capitalist societies. The West was the principal source of assistance and technical know-how for these reforms. Whereas Russia’s relationship with China was also of great importance, it was not as important as ties to the West—for China itself was undergoing major reforms, some very similar to Russia’s, and Beijing could not yet compare to the partnership with the West in terms of strategic and economic weight on the world stage.  Russia’s overall trade with European countries has remained considerably greater than that with Asia.11 China has emerged as the country’s biggest individual trading partner, but Europe collectively remains a considerably greater destination for its exports and source of its imports than Asia, as figure 1 shows.12 This is true despite the post-2014 Ukraine-related sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU and Russian countersanctions on EU goods.  The importance of Europe and the United States for Russia was further underscored by the resumption of tensions between Moscow on the one hand and Washington and Brussels on the other hand not long after the end of the Cold War. The launch in the mid-1990s of NATO’s eastward drive to admit new members among the countries of the former Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union marked the return of the Cold War–era geopolitical rivalry that continues to the present day and has become Russia’s principal national security concern.  Control of its neighboring states has long been the top foreign policy priority for Russia, both as a matter of historical legacy and of its long-standing quest for strategic depth as a hedge against external enemies. If thought of in terms of concentric circles, the immediate periphery of Russia in Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and—to a somewhat lesser extent—Central Asia constitutes the innermost, critical security belt and top tier of Russia’s diplomatic relationships. China, too, by virtue of its long border with Russia, is in that same category.13  Whereas the relationship between Russia and the West is dominated by the geopolitical competition for influence with the former Soviet states of Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus, no such competition exists between Russia and China. In fact, with the exception of Central Asia, where they have made a concerted effort to manage relations constructively, their geopolitical interests do not overlap but rather complement each other. Eastern Europe, which constitutes the primary sphere of geopolitical interest for Russia, is of relatively little interest to China, and the reverse can be said about their respective interests in the Western Pacific. Central Asia is less important for Russia than Europe and less consequential for China than the Western Pacific. Together, thanks to geography, Russia and China are able to dominate both Eastern Europe and Central Asia to the exclusion of other powers, and in these regions they share the goal of maintaining stability and minimizing the influence of the United States and its European allies, which they view as a source of instability.  With its focus on securing a sphere of influence in Europe, a two-front competition—in Europe with NATO and in Asia with China—would have been too much of an economic, military, and diplomatic burden for Russia. Therefore, its partnership with China is a geopolitical necessity.  A Pivot to China, Not to Asia  The year 2014 is often cited as a watershed in Russian foreign policy, when the Kremlin’s gradually deteriorating relationship with the United States and Europe reached a breaking point following the annexation of Crimea and the start of the undeclared war against Ukraine.14 In this narrative, after multiple attempts to form a partnership with the West, the Kremlin effectively decided that its numerous differences with Europe and the United States, accentuated by its handling of the crisis in Ukraine, could not be overcome. In this way, Moscow announced its strategic reorientation toward Asia as the primary theater of its efforts on the world stage and source of partnerships.15  In reality, however, there was no tangible pivot in 2014 and no discernable reorientation of Russian foreign policy toward Asia. Russia has remained largely focused on relations with the West, whereas its relations with Asia have been focused almost exclusively on China. If a watershed did occur, it was in relations with the West, which deteriorated sharply and consequently emerged as an even more important problem on the Kremlin’s agenda.  Contrary to conventional wisdom, the rapprochement between Russia and China did not begin in 2014. Their relationship had already been steadily improving for over a quarter century, since former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev visited China in 1989, which marked an end to a quarter-century rift that had at times brought the two countries to the brink of war.16 Gorbachev’s trip was a major milestone that, along with improved relations with the West, enabled the Kremlin to focus on domestic challenges.  Throughout the 1990s, as they underwent domestic reforms, neither Russia nor China had an interest in rekindling their Cold War ideological disputes, which by that time had lost their relevance. The two countries had few, if any, incentives to engage in competition, let alone confrontation in a geographic theater that was secondary to their principal national goals of domestic reform and reconstruction. For China, the United States and the Asia-Pacific constituted the primary area of economic and geopolitical interest, whereas for Russia, the main areas of concern were the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union that formed its immediate periphery, Europe, and the United States. The latter two were an important source of financial support for Russia’s struggling economy and thus the Kremlin deemed them to be high-priority relationships.  Sino-Russian relations continued to improve in the new century, as both countries ascended to greater prominence on the world stage.17 Their economic and political trajectories were marked by a great deal of complementarity and proved mutually reinforcing. With China emerging as an industrial and manufacturing powerhouse, its economy displayed an ever-growing appetite for resources. This was a unique opportunity for Russia, with its vast stores of natural resources, to jumpstart its economic growth. As figure 2 shows, the volume of trade between the two countries grew from less than $10 billion in the 1990s to nearly $70 billion by 2010 and well over $100 billion in 2018, with the stated goal of reaching $200 billion in 2024.18  With China and Russia each locked into antagonistic trade and economic relations with the United States, the two partners have pursued policies intended to reduce Washington’s role as the preeminent actor in global trade and finance as well as its ability to use its leading position as an economic weapon. Thus, in 2019, Beijing and Moscow agreed to increase the share of bilateral trade settled in their national currencies rather than in U.S. dollars.19 In 2018, in what appeared to be a response to U.S. sanctions as well as a symbolic gesture, the Central Bank of Russia sold more than $100 billion in U.S. holdings from its reserves and replaced them with euros and yuan.20 The move proved costly as Russia is estimated to have lost $8 billion as a result.21  Russian and Chinese leaders also share a similar approach to domestic politics. China never abandoned its authoritarian form of governance and one-party rule, while the presidency of Vladimir Putin saw Russia turn increasingly authoritarian after its experiment with democratic governance in the 1990s. For both countries, authoritarian domestic politics constitute a major source of friction in relations with the West. They consider criticism of their domestic political arrangements interference in their internal affairs, and they have found common cause in criticizing and opposing Western efforts to promote democratic governance in other countries as a form of political destabilization and a pretext for attempts at geopolitical expansion.  As figure 3 indicates, there appears to be a non-negligible correlation between the Russian public’s attitudes toward China and the United States.22 Positive public attitudes toward China have often coincided with negative attitudes toward the United States and vice versa. While foreign policy remains an elite issue in Russia, and public attitudes have only a limited impact at best on the direction of Russian foreign policy, the Kremlin has long been sensitive to public opinion as a legitimizing factor in its decisions, and on some occasions, the Russian public’s views have apparently influenced its decisions.23  In addition to Russia’s increasingly authoritarian domestic politics, geopolitics has emerged as a major source of friction with the West following the extension of membership in NATO and the European Union to countries that previously were part of the Soviet sphere of influence. This policy, viewed by the West as values-driven, has been viewed by Russia as a geopolitical move intended to expand the West’s sphere of influence at its expense in countries and regions it still considers to be part of its special sphere of interests and influence.  With the United States spearheading NATO’s eastward expansion and pursuing an activist policy with treaty allies and partners in the Western Pacific, Russia and China share an increasingly antagonistic relationship with the United States as their principal geopolitical rival. The growing friction between Russia and the West, which manifested itself in the Russian-Georgian war in 2008 over Georgia’s pursuit of membership in NATO, has been accompanied by ever-closer political, economic, and geopolitical ties between Russia and China. In 2006, the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) bloc was formed as a loose geopolitical association of non-Western rising powers, intended as a counterweight to the G8 (now G7) group of U.S.-led advanced Western democracies (and, until 2014, Russia).  The relationship between Russia and the West continued to deteriorate as Putin launched his third presidential term in 2012. In a highly symbolic gesture, he skipped the G8 meeting in the United States in May 2012, immediately after his inauguration, along with a bilateral meeting with then president Barack Obama.24 The start of his term was marked by large-scale protests against what many in Russia perceived as unfair elections and growing authoritarian governance. The protests were suppressed by forceful police intervention, and many members of the opposition were put on trial amid an official government onslaught on civil society. The suppression of the opposition and the legislative and administrative measures taken by the Russian government against nongovernmental and civil society organizations came under criticism from Washington and other Western capitals.25  Putin traveled to China in June 2012 for the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization—a regional forum led jointly by Russia and China—and for bilateral meetings with Chinese leaders.26 The visit resulted in an “enhanced strategic partnership” between the two countries.27 The following year, Xi Jinping chose Moscow as the destination for his first foreign trip as China’s president.28 Putin and Xi made a deliberate effort to put their personal imprimatur on the developing strategic partnership between their countries, embracing each other as “good friends”—a description that over the years graduated to “best friends.”29 In 2013, Russia and China agreed to boost Russian pipeline oil deliveries to China and build a new spur line from the Eastern Siberia–Pacific Ocean pipeline.30 In 2014, the two countries signed a thirty-year deal for $400 billion to build a new pipeline for the delivery of Russian natural gas to China.31  In addition to their intensifying diplomatic and economic ties, Russia and China have steadily expanded their military ties. In October 2019, in an unprecedented sign of strategic cooperation, Putin announced that Russia was helping China develop its early-warning system against missile attacks.32 Since the only potential source of attack against China for which such a system could be relevant is the United States, this sent a powerful message about the extent of the two countries’ cooperation in the defense and defense-industrial spheres, as well as about their shared assessment that the United States posed an existential threat to them.  But that was only the most recent sign of expanding defense cooperation. Russia and China have conducted bilateral drills and have participated in multilateral military exercises of increasing size and complexity.33 Their security relationship has been complemented by robust trade in arms since the 1990s, with Russia’s defense industry relying on China as a critical buyer of its outputs at a time when the country’s own defense budgets could not sustain it.34 With China developing and improving its own defense-industrial capabilities, its interest in Russian arms has somewhat faded, but it has remained an important customer for Russian defense manufacturers.  Moreover, Russian-Chinese defense-industrial cooperation has become more of a two-way street since 2014, when Western sanctions on Russia limited its industries, including in the defense sector, and its access to Western technology. Prior to that year, Russian defense industries had come to depend heavily on components imported from NATO countries and Ukraine.35 In an effort to overcome Western sanctions and the end of defense-industrial cooperation with Ukraine, Russia has pursued a program of domestic import substitution.36 By most accounts, including statements of senior Russian officials, that program has been mostly a failure.37  To make up for this failure, Russian manufacturers have sought alternative sources of components and equipment, which is likely to increase the country’s reliance on Chinese technology. Whereas the relatively low quality of Chinese-manufactured defense equipment has been an obstacle to increased defense-industrial cooperation, in the high-technology sector, including 5G, China is poised to expand its reach significantly into many different sectors of the Russian economy.38  By 2014—when Russia supposedly pivoted to Asia—the pattern of much-improved Russian-Chinese relations already was well-established. The watershed event that year was the drastic deterioration of Russia’s relationship with Europe and the United States. This was the start of what some have described as a “new Cold War” with the West, but there was relatively little new about Russia’s relationship with China, which by that time had already matured into a strategic partnership.39 There was therefore no pivot. Moreover, by 2014, Russia’s strategic partnership with China had developed, but Moscow had cultivated no such ties with other Asia-Pacific countries. This unbalanced Russian approach to the Asia-Pacific has intensified since then, and the relationship with China remains by far the most important, even dominant, priority on Russia’s agenda in the region.  Not an Asian Military Power  Russian forces in the Asia-Pacific are centered around its Eastern Military District (MD). They are postured mainly for strategic deterrence—for example, defending Russian ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) and strategic bomber forces, dominating the airspace and seas around the disputed Kuril Islands, and safeguarding the land border with China. Although there has been a modest increase in its long-distance force-projection capabilities, Russia lacks the assets and infrastructure to sustain high-intensity conventional operations at long ranges and is no match for the air and naval forces of the United States, especially if combined with the forces of U.S. allies and partners in the region.  The quadrennial Vostok military exercises always generate a lot of headlines—some of them overly dramatic.40 Although they are important to Russia for operational and symbolic reasons, they are intended to bolster its defensive positions in the region against potential attacks, however unlikely, from China, the United States, and Japan. They are also meant to guard against possible contingencies in the event that Moscow were to get embroiled in a conflict between China and a U.S.-led coalition.41 Nonetheless, the main military threats to Russia are in the west, not the east, and the modest forces Russia has deployed in the Eastern MD reflect its low threat perceptions in the Asia-Pacific.  Force Structure  Not surprisingly, the evolution of Russia’s military posture in the Asia-Pacific and its military capabilities in the Eastern MD mirror the country’s relatively modest interests and position in the region and the district’s low priority relative to others west of the Urals. Historically, the modernization of Russian ground, air, and naval forces in the region has lagged considerably behind force improvements in and around what Russia sees as its sphere of privileged influence in the former Soviet Union. Overall, as table 1 shows, there has been little quantitative growth in the force structure of the Eastern MD over time.42  Modernization has proceeded at a steady but unspectacular pace. Although there was a spike in the number of combat aircraft in the Eastern MD’s order-of-battle early in the 2010s, this resulted from the repurposing of naval aviation fighter-attack aircraft. The MD’s most significant acquisitions over the past ten years—such as the Iskander ballistic missile systems, the Su-35s, and the new generation of medium- and long-range air defense systems, including the S-400s—underscore the emphasis on replacing Soviet-era legacy weapons with more modern equipment and new technologies.  More importantly, the pattern of weapons acquisition in Siberia and the Far East over the past five years suggests that priority has been given to army formations responsible for defensive operations along the Sino-Russian border and the upgrading of anti-access/area-denial capabilities and infrastructure around the Kurils and Russia’s SSBN bastions. The military, for example, has fortified the Kurils with the deployment of surface-to-ship missiles and Su-35 fighters as well as the construction of more air bases. But Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu’s efforts to improve the maneuverability and reach of forces stationed in the Far East have been constrained by the Russian defense industry’s declining output, the demands of military operations in Ukraine and Syria, and concerns over NATO’s Four 30s readiness initiative.43 As a result of these factors, the Eastern MD is assigned a much lower priority level within the Russian armed forces than the Western and Southern MDs, which remain the center of attention for Russia’s military leadership.  Operations  Over the past decade, the naval forces assigned to the Eastern MD have received the same treatment as the armed forces overall with improved training, exercises, and more and better equipment.44 They have significantly intensified their combat training and operational activity, especially since 2012, when a noticeable qualitative leap took place and snap inspections of the combat readiness of units, army groups, and operational-strategic commands were introduced. The military placed a major emphasis on improving operational flexibility and maneuverability within and between different theaters. Military exercises in the region have also increased. Over the past decade, Russia has expanded the number of large-scale military drills it conducts around Japan as well as the frequency of incursions by its bombers into Japanese airspace.45  The Vostok exercises in 2010, 2014, and 2018 were the largest since the Cold War and involved forces from the Central and Eastern MDs. (Troops from China and Mongolia also participated in 2014 and 2018.46 Invariably attracting a lot of public attention and media headlines, these exercises are intended primarily to verify the combat readiness and mobilization capabilities of units in the Far East and to signal that, as one military expert put it, while Russia may not be an Asian power, it remains a power in Asia.47 This show of force has assumed greater significance now that a new shipping route may open in the Arctic between Europe and Asia as a result of the warming climate.  Annual Russian-Chinese military exercises—part of a broader effort to improve naval cooperation with China as called for in Russia’s 2015 Maritime Doctrine—have also captured headlines.48 In recent years, the two countries have continued to expand military cooperation in areas such as combined exercises, technology, and high-level exchanges. The exercises are not structured, however, to strengthen combined war-fighting capabilities but rather to improve Russia’s ability to execute its missions in and around the Eastern MD in such areas as amphibious operations, air defense, and anti-submarine warfare. They also serve to improve strategic-level military-to-military communications with China. But, according to Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military, these exercises and other drills are not viewed as intended “to increase interoperability, or tactical level cooperation, so much as operational or strategic deconfliction.”49  While the scope and pace of Russian military activities in the region have increased over the past decade, it is important to see them in a broader context. Russia’s strategic orientation in the Far East is largely defensive. Its military establishment, like any other, has to plan and prepare for worst-case contingencies, which in this case would be principally a large-scale conventional conflict with China, the United States, Japan, or a U.S.-led coalition50 scenarios, however remote, would present formidable operational and logistical challenges because of the distance and lack of extensive transportation infrastructure to connect the Eastern MD to the rest of Russia and limits on the inter-theater mobility of wartime reinforcements from other military districts.  Many Russian military exercises are designed to help the military command test its new brigade-size military formations and joint command-and-control structures for fighting a large-scale war as well as test a national military mobilization system in which military and civilian authorities must work together in a “whole-of-government” effort.51 The Eastern MD is unique. Unlike other Russian military districts, it must plan to fight alone—and for as long as possible—until reinforcements arrive from the Central MD; furthermore, it must carry out this task without the kind of robust infrastructure that is common in military districts west of the Urals. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Eastern MD is home to many self-sufficient ground-force formations and missile brigades.52  Naval Capabilities  Russian naval forces in the Western Pacific have received new equipment, such as cruise missiles and more modern corvettes and patrol boats, to improve their combat capabilities.53 But as table 2 illustrates, the Pacific fleet in the Far East still plays second fiddle to other fleets in areas that have been assigned a higher geographic priority. It is, in effect, a small brown-water coastal navy. The fleet is configured for close-in defense missions to protect SSBN bases and the nearby waters in which they operate (for strategic deterrence), the maritime approaches to its major installations, the Arctic Sea, Russia’s exclusive economic zones, and nearby waters that contain a wealth of mineral resources. In other words, the focus of the Pacific Fleet is mainly on sea denial rather than sea control missions in open-ocean operations. Further, the small number of major surface combatants assigned to it precludes a significant forward-deployed peacetime naval presence beyond its immediate waters.  Russia’s 2015 Maritime Doctrine also makes clear that the Pacific Fleet serves important geopolitical purposes, including presenting Russia as a more influential actor in Asia and as an alternative to states in the region that remain wary of Chinese and U.S. hegemony.54 In addition, the Maritime Doctrine states that the navy will try to avoid open conflict with China and the United States, as well as escalation of tensions in the South China Sea, and that its show-the-flag operations will take the form of small deployments that do not require massive blue-water capabilities—positions that underscore Russia’s priority of boosting its naval presence on its western and northern flanks.  In sum, the improvements in the force-projection capabilities of the Russian Navy in the Asia-Pacific are starting from a very low baseline and have registered only modest growth over the past decade—they require continued monitoring by the United States but should not be a cause for concern. Moscow’s improved anti-access/area-denial capabilities in and around the Eastern MD would only present problems if the U.S. military is planning to conduct large-scale conventional operations against Russia in its own backyard, which is hard to imagine under any circumstances.  Russia’s Japan Misfire  Aside from its partnership with China, Russia’s other critical relationship in the Asia-Pacific is with Japan. The country has the potential to serve as a counterbalance to Russia’s seemingly relentless tilt toward China in the region and more broadly on the world stage. It is the world’s third-largest economy, a technological powerhouse, and a treaty ally of the United States.55 Japan and Russia share a maritime border, have fought two wars in the twentieth century, and still have an unresolved territorial dispute.  The most important feature of the relationship between the two countries, however, is its unrealized potential, which puts in sharper focus the unbalanced nature of Russian diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific. Although the two countries’ economic relationship is rich with opportunities—Russia is uniquely endowed with natural resources and Japan is a global manufacturing and technological powerhouse—these complementarities have remained largely unfulfilled. Bilateral trade has not exceeded $30 billion annually, and in 2018 was only about $20 billion.56 Japanese investment in the Russian economy has been sluggish and focused largely on major energy projects. Keen to improve bilateral relations overall, the two governments have encouraged greater investment, but these overtures have been met with skepticism from a Japanese business community reluctant to commit funds to Russia’s unwelcoming investing environment.57  The two countries’ trade and economic relationship has long been a victim of geopolitics. The key obstacle has been the problem of the four Southern Kuril Islands occupied by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II, which were previously held by Japan. Successive Japanese governments have tried to reclaim them for over seventy years. The dispute over the islands, referred to in Japan as the Northern Territories, has stood in the way of the two countries concluding a peace treaty to finally put the legacy of World War II behind them.  The record of the Russian-Japanese relationship since the end of the Cold War is one of false starts, dashed hopes, and unrealized compromises on the fate of the islands that could have resulted in the full normalization of relations. Toward the end of the Soviet era and in the early post-Soviet era, Russian diplomats dropped hints that a compromise would be acceptable to the new government, based on a vague formula dating back to 1956, when the two countries restored diplomatic relations and agreed in principle on the return of two of the four islands.58 However, those hints remained unrealized, and the issue remains unresolved, standing in the way of better relations, despite repeated attempts by Japanese leaders to find a mutually acceptable solution.59  The most recent initiative to resolve the diplomatic problem of the Northern Territories has been pursued by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who has made relations with Russia a major foreign policy priority throughout his term in office beginning in 2012.60 Abe’s personal diplomacy with Putin, including multiple visits to Russia and less frequent visits by Putin to Japan, has yet to produce results on this issue.61 Abe’s apparent but largely unstated geopolitical goal—to encourage a more balanced Russian policy in the Asia-Pacific at the expense of Russian-Chinese relations—has not been realized either, as Moscow continues on its trajectory of a near-exclusive partnership with Beijing.62  In one-sided fashion, Russia and Putin have been the obvious beneficiaries of Abe’s diplomatic efforts. For Putin, engagement with Abe presented a welcome opportunity to chip away at the G7 leaders’ efforts to isolate the Russian president following the annexation of Crimea. Abe’s pursuit of better economic relations with Russia has enabled Putin to demonstrate that the Western sanctions imposed on Russia since 2014 are far from unanimous. His visits to Japan in 2016 and 2019 not only offered opportunities to reaffirm his standing as a major world leader but also served as a platform to make anti-American statements and throw jabs at the U.S.-Japanese alliance, making clear that the real target of Russian policy in the Asia-Pacific is the United States.63  The bleak prospects for a breakthrough in Russian-Japanese relations or even a modest rebalancing in Russian policy in the Asia-Pacific away from China have been underscored by the intensification of Russian-Chinese military cooperation, including joint air patrols, intrusions in Japanese airspace, and naval exercises in the South China Sea.64 In addition to these high-profile military activities, the Russian Ministry of Defense has announced its plans to beef up its anti-access/area-denial capabilities on the Kuril Islands.65  To add insult to injury, official Russian rhetoric on the subject has even turned offensive. For example, in 2015, Dmitry Rogozin, then deputy prime minister in charge of defense issues, responded to Japanese protests against a visit to the Kurils by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev by inviting Japanese officials to commit suicide.66 During his second visit to the islands in 2019, Medvedev casually dismissed Japanese objections and territorial claims as groundless.67  There is little, if any, chance of Russia changing its stance on the Kurils and vis-à-vis Japan in general. A meaningful rapprochement with Tokyo would require significant territorial concessions from Russia—something that great powers do not do in the Kremlin’s estimation. Moreover, those concessions would have to be made to a treaty ally of the United States, whose policies are viewed as an existential threat by the Kremlin.68 In the charged zero-sum geopolitical environment of the U.S.-Russian-Chinese triangular relationship, a Russian concession to Japan (and therefore the United States) would come at the expense of its relationship with China, which the Kremlin has long prioritized as the essential partnership in light of the adversarial relationship the two maintain with Washington.  China in the Lead on North Korea  In the early 2000s, there were high expectations that Russian–North Korean relations had a promising future. The two countries had historically close ties: North Korea was a major buyer of Russian arms, bilateral trade was growing, thousands of North Koreans were working in Russia, and ambitious plans were being drawn up to use the country as a trans-shipment point for Russian natural gas exports to South Korea and to connect the Russian Far East to Europe via the Trans-Siberian Railroad.69 Russia was opposed to North Korea acquiring nuclear weapons but believed that threats, sanctions, and efforts to isolate its regime would fail to alter the country’s behavior.  Today, these expectations remain largely unfulfilled, and the relationship involves a great deal of muddling through. North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un may be able to arrange symbolically important summit meetings with Putin, but there have been few tangible results. Due to Moscow’s own budget constraints, trade and investment links between the two countries remain weak, and Russia’s ambitious schemes for the development of regional infrastructure never got off the drawing board. Moscow has declined to subsidize the North Korean economy or invest in Pyongyang’s efforts to build infrastructure. Further, the two countries continue to spar over illegal North Korean fishing in Russian waters, and Pyongyang has been hurt economically by Moscow’s expulsion of North Korean workers in compliance with UN Security Council sanctions enacted in 2017.  Russia’s ties with South Korea have not fared much better. Russian designs for exporting liquefied natural gas to the country have foundered because of the poor investment climate in Russia and instability on the Korean Peninsula. More importantly, South Korea sees little benefit in forging closer relations with Russia, because only China has the leverage to influence North Korea’s behavior.70 When the government of President Moon Jae-in wants to cajole North Korea back to the negotiating table, it turns to Washington and Beijing for support, not Moscow. At the same time, Russian–South Korean two-way trade in 2018 was a modest $25 billion—only 7 percent of total Russian foreign trade.71  For most of the past twenty years, Russia has consistently pursued three outcomes with regard to North Korea: seeking denuclearization, preventing war on the Korean Peninsula, and preventing regime change. These goals are closely aligned with China’s preferred outcomes and priorities. However, since 2014, Moscow has pursued them within the broader context of its new strategic partnership with China, which has led to a major realignment of its approach to relations with North Korea. As one Russian expert on the country has observed, “Moscow seems to tacitly acknowledge the Korean Peninsula as China’s sphere of influence and generally follows Beijing’s lead in this region. North Korea is obviously not among the Kremlin’s top foreign policy priorities.”72  It is largely for these reasons that Russia has followed China’s lead in helping North Korea evade implementation of some UN Security Council sanctions (for example, ship-to-ship transfers of prohibited items) and since late 2019 has blocked the enactment of any new sanctions. As a result of this unified position, the two countries have severely undercut the United States’ campaign of maximum pressure. Short of a resumption of nuclear testing or unprovoked and highly provocative military actions by North Korea, Moscow and Beijing are unlikely to support new sanctions, even if Pyongyang resumes its testing of longer-range ballistic missiles. If U.S.–North Korean denuclearization negotiations resume, Russia and China would almost certainly back Pyongyang’s efforts to avoid immediate and complete denuclearization and an intrusive verification regime. They would instead favor capping and rolling back North Korea’s nuclear weapons program with minimal verification procedures as part of an incremental process of reciprocal North Korean and U.S concessions.  Russia’s perspective and positions on the North Korean nuclear issue are not a function of the economic, military, or commercial opportunities it sees in North Korea and on the peninsula more broadly. Rather, they are driven by the Kremlin’s fear that a U.S. military conflict with North Korea could have highly destabilizing consequences on Russia’s borders; the desire for Russia to be seen as a major diplomatic player on the peninsula; and a desire to prevent further nuclear proliferation and a buildup of U.S. forces in the region that it would find threatening. Thus, in contrast to conflicts in the South China Sea where it is largely a bystander, as discussed below, when it comes to North Korea, Russia will press vigorously for a seat at the table, with veto power, over any resolution pursued by the United States and other parties to the conflict in order to support its claim to superpower status.  In addition to concerns about prestige and recognition as a global power, Russia has several more tangible interests at stake on the Korean Peninsula, which overlap with China’s but are very different from those of the United States. Like their Chinese counterparts, Russian policymakers do not see North Korean nuclear weapons and missiles as a direct threat to their country’s security; instead, they view them as Pyongyang’s ultimate insurance policy against U.S.-engineered regime change. From Russia’s perspective, North Korea’s nuclear capability presents a threat only as a potential trigger for a crisis on the peninsula that would lead to a U.S.-North Korean confrontation or outright war and desperate actions by Pyongyang that would prompt a U.S. invasion to topple the Kim regime. Pressuring Pyongyang, as Moscow has repeatedly warned, is unlikely to deliver the results that Washington is trying to achieve and would only aggravate tensions—a position shared by Beijing that is unlikely to change absent a change in China’s overall strategic direction. Any future improvement in U.S.-Russian relations would not prompt Moscow to alter its stance on the North Korean problem either.  As Russia looks to the future, it probably would prefer the status quo to other potential end states. It would be extremely wary, for example, of peaceful unification, which it believes would be accomplished on South Korea’s terms and result in a significant expansion of U.S. influence and perhaps the deployment of U.S. troops closer to Russia’s borders. In this case, too, there is a convergence between Russian and Chinese interests in preserving North Korea’s status as a security buffer.  In sum, because the Korean Peninsula is of far less importance to Russia than it is to China, and because Beijing possesses far more leverage over Pyongyang than Moscow does, Russia is unlikely to allow any daylight to develop between its position and China’s stance on North Korea.  Russia Missing In Action on Southeast Asia  Despite much of the fanfare surrounding its Asia-Pacific pivot, the results of Russia’s more active engagement in Southeast Asia since 2016 have proven to be meager. The Kremlin has had some success in expanding arms sales, trade, and energy cooperation with several members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), but relations with the organization itself are largely devoid of substance, and bilateral relations with Moscow’s most important regional partners—Vietnam, Indonesia, and Myanmar—have yet to reach their full potential.  Since the creation of a Russian-ASEAN dialogue in 1996, the region has not loomed large in the Kremlin’s foreign policy, and Russia has been peripheral to ASEAN’s pursuit of its regional agenda, particularly the development of a security order based on multilateral cooperation among its member states and with outside powers.  The Russia-ASEAN Summit held in Sochi on the Black Sea in 2016 generated expectations that the relationship would be put on a more positive trajectory. Leaders agreed in the Sochi Declaration on the goal of building a strategic partnership and an action plan to strengthen and deepen ties over the following five years, especially in terms of combating international terrorism, drug trafficking, and crime as well as expanding trade and commercial opportunities.73 Putin spoke effusively about cementing Russian-ASEAN relations.74 Moscow certainly had incentives to broaden and deepen its ties to the region, including finding new markets for energy and arms exports to offset the economic effects of Western sanctions, demonstrating that Russia could not be isolated, and leveraging the region’s dynamism to help modernize its economy, especially in the Russian Far East. In fact, Southeast Asia and the development of Russia’s relations with ASEAN figured prominently in Russia’s turn to the Asia-Pacific.  But the Sochi summit was not the inflection point in the relationship that some observers had pinned their hopes on two years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and after the imposition of Western sanctions prompted the Kremlin to make its pivot to the Asia-Pacific. There was more symbolism than substance, and the “Spirit of Sochi” evaporated quickly. Tactically, the summit was a success. Russia was able to demonstrate that it was not isolated and that the countries of Southeast Asia were treating it like a great power. For its part, ASEAN exploited the opportunity to advance its aspirations for a central leadership role in developing a multilateral security architecture for the region.75  But six years after the invasion of Ukraine and four years after Sochi, Russia’s relationship with ASEAN remains underdeveloped. It carries little weight within the organization, even though it has been more actively engaged at the political level and, in 2018, upgraded the relationship to the level of a strategic partnership.76 Several stubborn realities have hindered the development of a more mature and productive relationship. Most fundamentally, institutional ties between Russia and ASEAN remain weak because neither side needs the other that much.  First, Southeast Asia is not a high priority for Russia, where it has no core interests. Russia sees itself as a European country and as a great power; it is, therefore, focused on its relations with Europe, China, and the United States and on preserving its dominant position in its near abroad. Even within the Asia-Pacific, Southeast Asia tends to take a backseat not only to China but also to Northeast Asia and India. Reflecting this hierarchy of priorities and its marginal interests in the region, Russia’s expertise and institutional mechanisms for diplomatic and economic engagement are tilted heavily toward Eurasia and not the Asia-Pacific.77 In addition, trade and economic relations with ASEAN have been slow to develop because Russia’s political elite and business leaders are Eurocentric and fixated on the United States (see figure 4).78 Moreover, though Russia’s foreign policy leadership is intent on accelerating movement toward a multipolar world, it does not see ASEAN as a counterweight to U.S. power.  Second, the value proposition for Russia in the region is its strong strategic partnership with China, which it has prioritized over expanding its influence in Southeast Asia. Moscow derives substantial economic, diplomatic, and geopolitical benefits from this partnership.79 Although Russian foreign policy officials have expressed growing interest in cultivating closer ties with ASEAN, Moscow is not about to put these equities at risk to side with ASEAN countries on their territorial disputes with China or to join them and the United States in an effort to contain the expansion of Chinese influence in the region. The meager benefits Russia accrues from its relations with ASEAN reinforce this caution. For all intents and purposes, the Kremlin has acknowledged China’s leading role in the region, and Beijing regards Southeast Asia as its sphere of influence.80 In effect, Russian policy in Southeast Asia is hostage to Chinese behavior.  Third, notwithstanding a long record of lofty pronouncements about developing a strategic partnership, Russia’s relationship with ASEAN has been hampered not only by its sensitivity to Chinese concerns but also by its ambivalent attitude toward the organization. Russia has made a clear calculation that its primary interests in the region—arms sales and expanded economic and energy ties—are best pursued through bilateral relationships rather than through ASEAN, which has a well-deserved reputation as a so-called talk shop that is incapable, for political and cultural reasons, of taking concerted collective action due to divisions among its members. This is as true of the organization itself as it is of its two premier offshoots, the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asian Summit.  Fifth, ASEAN recognizes that it cannot count on Russia to choose its relations with Southeast Asia over its partnership with China: the multilateral bloc realizes that it would not like the outcome if it tries to force Moscow to make a choice between the two. It is therefore not prepared to place a bet on Russia to check the growth of Chinese power or to restrain assertive Chinese behavior. Russia correctly sees ASEAN’s efforts to build a new security architecture as another form of containing China, an objective that it does not share in Southeast Asia. In addition, while Moscow would like to see a more multilateral and muscular ASEAN balance against U.S. power in the region, it will not risk antagonizing China by aligning more closely with the organization.  Simply put, Russia sees ASEAN as neither an opportunity nor a threat to its core interests, and cultivating closer relations with the bloc ranks very low on its list of foreign policy priorities. Moscow’s main goal is to raise its profile with the organization and, along with China, balance against U.S. power in the region. Unsurprisingly, therefore, there is a large gap between Russia’s rhetorical commitment to developing a strategic relationship with ASEAN and realities on the ground; it could not be otherwise, as neither side sees great potential in their relationship, and both are resigned to the fact that progress toward more productive ties will be slow and incremental. Even though Russia would like to enable ASEAN to become a more effective counterbalance to U.S. dominance, it will not do so at the expense of its much more important relationship with China. In this sense, Russia is China’s de facto junior partner in Southeast Asia and should not be seen as a truly independent regional actor. Over the next several years, the Kremlin will be preoccupied with more important and pressing challenges (such as Syria, Ukraine, relations with the United States, and dealing with the coronavirus pandemic).  Lackluster Bilateral Ties in Southeast Asia  Russia will continue to pursue its energy, trade, commercial, and military interests with individual members of ASEAN, but cooperation in these areas is likely to be limited not only by its strategic priorities but also by regional realities. Russia has exported arms, civilian nuclear technology, and hydrocarbons to Indonesia and Vietnam as well as invested in energy production ventures in these countries. But these deals have been relatively small and have failed to meet Russian expectations. Moreover, as Russia experts on Southeast Asia have noted, they do not provide a basis for a solid and sustained partnership.81  Figure 5 offers a more detailed look at two-way economic ties between Russia and ASEAN countries.82 Trade between Russia and the bloc’s members remains negligible. Between 2012 and 2018, Russian exports to and imports from these countries increased from $15.6 billion to $19.2 billion.83 In 2018, two-way trade represented only 2 percent of Russian global exports and 4.3 percent of Russian global imports.84 Vietnam is Russia’s best trading partner in the region, yet the total import-export dollar value of even their bilateral trade barely registers, and it is dwarfed by Vietnam’s bilateral trade with the China, the United States, and several other countries in the region.  The two-way flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) between Russia and ASEAN countries tells much the same story. In 2018, Russian FDI in ASEAN countries totaled $9.2 billion, while the latter’s FDI in Russia amounted to around $4.4 billion.85 Further, any progress that ASEAN countries hope to make in modernizing and diversifying their economies will depend on inputs from non-Russian foreign investment and technology.  Russia is an important source of military hardware for ASEAN members (see table 3). Between 2000 and 2019, members of the regional bloc accounted for 9 percent of Russia’s global arms exports, which amounted to 27 percent of ASEAN arms imports.86 Vietnam is Russia’s largest arms customer, purchasing over $6 billion in new military equipment from it since 2005.87 Between 2000 and 2016, it imported more than 80 percent of its arms from Russia.88 Most of these acquisitions were comprised primarily of combat aircraft and associated weaponry, training aircraft, attack submarines, helicopters, and surface combatants. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar have also made purchases of major military assets, including combat aircraft, tanks, and heavy-lift transport helicopters.  Over the past decade, Russia has signed a number of contracts with ASEAN countries for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas and refined products (see table 4). Vietnam and Indonesia are the primary destinations for its energy investments. Russia and Vietnam have signed several major contracts for joint ventures to explore, develop, and produce hydrocarbons; in recent years, their joint venture Vietsovpetro has generated annual revenues of nearly $2 billion.89 In 2017, Rosneft and Indonesia’s Pertamina inked a major agreement to invest $15 billion to develop a new oil refinery and petrochemical complex in East Java.90 Once completed, the facility is expected to become a major regional hub for distribution of Siberian oil throughout Southeast Asia. Russia has also concluded agreements for smaller energy projects with Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand.  From Russia’s perspective, expanded trade, energy, transportation, and investment relations were supposed to cement its new relationship with the members of ASEAN, but these ties have proven to be uneven. Since Russia and ASEAN upgraded their relationship from a dialogue to a strategic partnership in 2018, more agreements have been announced than implemented, and the progress that has been made is less impressive than meets the eye because—with exceptions like Vietnam and to a lesser extent Indonesia and Myanmar—Russia and ASEAN members started from a low baseline. The reality is that, in the five years since Russia and ASEAN concluded the Sochi Declaration, two-way, nonmilitary trade relations have been slow in developing.  Russian arms sales are the exception to this rule. They have increased substantially over the past fifteen years, largely as a result of three factors: a huge increase in ASEAN military expenditures, objections of ASEAN countries to human-rights conditions the United States attaches to its arms sales, and a desire to balance against China by developing improved ties with Russia. However, even though ASEAN members want to buy weapons and Russia wants to sell them, as one Russian expert on the region has noted, “Without meaningful economic or trade ties, no mutually beneficial relationship can develop.”91 These ties have yet to materialize. Russia has not concluded a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with any member of ASEAN, while the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union has failed thus far to sign one with ASEAN and has concluded only two bilateral FTAs, with Vietnam and Singapore. Tellingly, Russia is not yet a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a free trade agreement between the ten members of ASEAN and several other countries in the region.  Similarly, although Russia has seen ASEAN as a potentially lucrative market for its civilian nuclear power reactors, its expectations have yet to be fulfilled for several reasons. Some ASEAN countries, notably Indonesia and Malaysia, are energy producers and exporters, and they are thus competing for market share with Russia’s energy firms. Second, regional demand for civilian nuclear power has been slow to develop—Vietnam is the only country in ASEAN that has purchased a civilian nuclear plant from Russia. As one energy expert has noted, given the high cost and safety concerns, “Nuclear power will not feature soon in ASEAN’s energy mix for at least the next 20 years.”92 Finally, while there is growing demand among ASEAN countries for renewable energy sources other than nuclear power, Russia appears to have very little interest in pushing wind, hydroelectric, and solar power technologies that would undercut its exports of oil and natural gas.  Implications for U.S. Policy  These insights about Russian diplomatic strategy and foreign policy priorities in the Asia-Pacific have important implications for U.S. policymaking in the region.  China  The shift from the Global War on Terrorism that dominated U.S. national security thinking and policy for the better part of two decades following the attacks of September 11, 2001, to great-power competition with Russia and, increasingly, China, has cast into a sharper relief the strategic partnership between Moscow and Beijing. The break between Russia and the West has underscored the two countries’ diplomatic, economic, military, and geopolitical alignment. This shift has raised concerns in the U.S. strategic community that their emerging alliance poses a grave threat to U.S. interests.94 Some analysts, including some who were involved in developing the United States’ National Security Strategy, have argued for the adoption of a wedge strategy to prevent further Russian-Chinese alignment.95 This is an unrealistic and impractical proposition for the following reasons:  The strategic partnership between Russia and China is rooted in their domestic political, economic, and geopolitical complementarity and in the confluence of their interests and threat perceptions.  Both countries consider the United States the primary challenger to their interests. It would take a fundamental revision of U.S. policy to change that perception.  The partnership is reinforced by the personal commitments of the presidents of both countries.  The partnership predates Russia’s 2014 break with the West. It began with the country emerging from the Cold War greatly weakened and in need of a strategic realignment to concentrate on issues and regions at the top of its list of priorities.  Russia remains a European rather than an Asian nation. Its key interests are at stake in Europe rather than in Asia. Good relations with China are a strategic necessity for Russia, as they enable Moscow to focus on its key interests elsewhere; and its leaders see no alternative to this close partnership, which is increasingly looking like an alliance.  Even if Washington successfully pulled off a divide-and-conquer strategy with respect to Russia and China, the consequences for the United States would likely be disappointing. Russia is not a major force either in the economic and technological competition between the United States and China or in the Asia-Pacific where the principal U.S.-Chinese geopolitical competition is unfolding. In the area of defense and military technology, China is increasingly a more powerful actor than Russia. Over time, defense cooperation between them is likely to be of diminishing value to China. In Europe and the Middle East and North Africa, where Russia has reemerged as an active player militarily and geopolitically, China is not yet a major factor, though it is in discussions with Iran about forming a strategic partnership. A less cooperative relationship between them would be unlikely to prove consequential for Russia’s posture in these two regions.  Some aspects of the Russia-China partnership are potentially even beneficial for U.S. interests. For example, the complementarity of their two economies is a factor for stability in Eurasia, as it helps satisfy China’s demand for resources and Russia’s need to find a reliable market for its exports.  In addition, the key sources of tension between the United States and China, on the one hand, and between the United States and Russia, on the other, are mostly disconnected. They have little bearing on each other. Russia is a marginal actor in the geopolitics of the Asia-Pacific and thus is largely inconsequential to the regional competition between the United States and China. The same can be said about China in Europe and the standoff between Russia and NATO.  In sum, the main task for the United States in dealing with these two countries is to develop a viable strategy for each. Their partnership has little bearing on U.S. interests and runs the risk of becoming a distraction from what matters most for the United States, which is deftly managing its two distinct relationships with China and Russia.  The Korean Peninsula  The U.S. strategy for dealing with Russia’s approach to the Korean Peninsula should be one of co-optation rather than isolation. Russia wants to be—and wants to be perceived as—a major player on the peninsula. This is a historic role that it has played and, in broad terms, it has been supportive of U.S. nonproliferation objectives in North Korea, though there are differences over approaches, tactics, and priorities. Should Moscow and Washington ever resume a high-level strategic dialogue, preventing the further growth of North Korean nuclear capabilities should be a high priority in their broader nonproliferation agenda.  Russia will pursue its goals on the Korean Peninsula in lockstep with China, and Beijing will want Moscow to have a voice at the table. Both countries can be counted on to restrain belligerent North Korean behavior that would risk a large-scale war or precipitate additional U.S. military deployments that both would find threatening, such as negotiations on regional missile defense arrangements or the reintroduction of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on South Korean territory. Simply put, Russia can be part of the solution rather than part of the problem on the North Korea nuclear issue if the United States is willing to show flexibility on the issues of denuclearization and sanctions. Alternatively, along with Beijing, Moscow can be a spoiler, making it more difficult for Washington to achieve its preferred outcomes.  Southeast Asia  When it comes to Russia’s national security interests and pretensions to superpower status, there is not as much at stake in Southeast Asia as in Northeast Asia. Still, the United States faces the same geopolitical reality in both regions. The Kremlin will not allow any distance to develop between its positions and China’s, barring a change in the trajectory of Chinese policies that is detrimental to Russian interests. Accordingly, Russia is likely to be of little geopolitical value to the United States in its efforts to balance against China in the region, especially in the South China Sea. Moscow’s main priority in Southeast Asia is to avoid antagonizing China over the disputes that roil the region. This posture is reflected in its endorsement of China’s view that outside powers should not interfere in the territorial disputes over islands and maritime features in the South China Sea as well as in Russian-Chinese military exercises in the region. That said, Russia is a marginal actor at best in the South China Sea, and this is likely to remain the case for the indefinite future due to its limited interests there. Thus, any attempt by the United States to drive a wedge between China and Russia over Southeast Asia is doomed to fail and would only further aggravate tensions in the U.S.-China relationship.  In waging its great-power competition with Russia, the United States does not need to be overly concerned about countering every move Moscow makes to improve military and security cooperation with members of ASEAN. To be sure, Russia has enjoyed modest success in expanding its military presence in the region, concluding defense cooperation agreements with several countries that permit increased ship visits and logistics and operational support for Russian military operations as well as improved intelligence sharing. As a result of these arrangements, Russia’s naval and air forces are able to sustain a higher operational tempo, and its military has improved capabilities to keep a closer eye on U.S. forces operating in the region.  Nonetheless, these enhancements need to be put into perspective. First, they have only marginally improved Russia’s capacity for projecting military power in Southeast Asia, reflecting the overall deterioration of Russian forces in its Far Eastern MD. More importantly, Russia has not challenged the United States’ two core interests in the region: ensuring freedom of navigation and maintaining the capability to project power there should China threaten the security of Taiwan. Russia has not interfered with freedom of navigation in the Western Pacific and would likely adopt a position of neutrality in any conflict between China and the United States over Taiwan. The bottom line is that U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific continue to enjoy overwhelming conventional military superiority over Russian forces.  Moreover, Russian inroads in the region notwithstanding, most members of ASEAN continue to value closer commercial and military relations with the United States, primarily because they want to diversify their relationships to maintain a posture of nonalignment, create more room to maneuver among the three great powers in the region, and hedge their bets against an expansionist China. Consequently, successful Russian efforts to expand trade, investment, nuclear-reactor and arms sales, energy exports, and infrastructure cooperation in the region should not be cause for U.S. alarm or even concern. These Russian overtures are likely to produce only modest results. Although the ASEAN market encompasses 600 million people, U.S. commercial and economic stakes in the region are modest—annual exports to ASEAN countries total roughly $85 billion, or only 5.2 percent of all U.S. exports.96 Russia is not a major source of capital or technology for Southeast Asian countries; its trade with ASEAN countries, as previously discussed, is minuscule, and the region is not a major destination for Russian energy exports. Vietnam’s ties with Russia have not hampered the development of closer relations with the United States with expanded trade as well as social and diplomatic engagement. The same is true for Indonesia and Malaysia, the two other major regional powers.  Continuity or Change?  The one-sided nature of Russia’s policy in the Asia-Pacific and its embrace of China as a virtually exclusive partner on the world stage has sparked some controversy inside the country. Several academic and think-tank analysts have questioned the benefits and the wisdom of such a one-sided relationship since the so-called pivot of 2014.97 While few, if any, challenge the necessity of good relations with Russia’s ever-more powerful neighbor, some experts have pointed out that the partnership with China has delivered relatively little for Russia economically, diplomatically, or geopolitically.  The coronavirus pandemic has cast a shadow on the Russian-Chinese partnership. Anti-Chinese sentiments have long been present in parts of the Russian Far East and Siberia.98 The spread of the virus from China to Russia has contributed to these feelings. In a rush to limit the pandemic, the Kremlin took steps targeting Chinese nationals in Russia, which prompted complaints from the Chinese authorities.99 Russia closed its border with China in January—a move that China reciprocated in April to prevent the reverse spread of the virus from Russia.100  But these voices and incidents are highly unlikely to significantly change the relationship. Some analysts have even argued that Russia and China could become even closer as a result of the pandemic.101 The prospect that China may have a more rapid and robust economic recovery indicates that Beijing could become an even more important market for Russian exports, while Europe—home to many of Russia’s other principal trading partners—may lag behind. China’s technological dominance, including in such spheres as 5G and artificial intelligence, which have great potential not only as engines of economic development but also of domestic societal control, are already proving highly attractive to the Kremlin as it looks ahead to years of slow economic growth, declining standards of living, and the possibility of popular unrest.  Moreover, Russia’s partnership with China is a personal priority for Putin and is undoubtedly one of the great accomplishments of his two decades at the helm. A major adjustment, let alone a reversal of that relationship, would constitute an admission on the part of the Russian leader of a fundamental mistake in his foreign policy. With Putin poised to remain in office until at least 2036 and probably for the rest of his life, Russia’s ever-closer partnership with China is here to stay.  Russia’s top priorities in the Asia-Pacific lie beyond the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia, and Moscow does not have much to offer these potential partners. In both respects, Russia is content to serve as China’s de facto junior partner. Thus, all roads the United States may pursue for gaining Moscow’s support for or acquiescence to U.S. policies toward North Korea and in Southeast Asia run through Beijing. Because Russian and Chinese interests and priorities in both regions are highly convergent, any notion that the United States could drive a wedge between the two countries on these issues represents magical thinking.  The geopolitical geometry of great-power competition in the Asia-Pacific will not be triangular. China and the United States will be the main players in the contest for regional supremacy. Russia will be an interested but not terribly influential bystander, ready to take advantage of openings created by U.S. mistakes and miscues. This does not mean that Washington should or can ignore Moscow, but it does mean that U.S. leaders, experts, analysts, and politicians should not obsess about Russia stealing a march on the United States and eroding its influence in the region.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Act East Policy (AEP), built on PV Narasimha Rao’s Look East Policy, stands on the proverbial shoulders of thousands of emissaries who, over millennia, forged robust bonds with India’s eastern neighbours.  Sustainability of regional multilateralism — a well-recognised necessity in a post-Covid-19 and post-Galwan world — hinges on not just building alliances of political convenience, but also sharing a common world view. This view is a function of a multiplicity of factors — socioeconomic, geopolitical and geostrategic — underlying which is a cultural foundation dating back over 1,000 years. The subtle recognition of the Dharmic moorings of large parts of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) bloc and beyond has kept people-to-people contact warm since Independence.  Yet, in a post-Nehruvian consensus era, India would be well placed to take it a step further by reimagining itself as the cultural homeland for the region’s nearly half a billion Buddhists, whose philosophies and practices remain deeply intertwined with what is known as “Hinduism”. It is in this context that the Ramayana and Buddhist circuits — a part of the Indian government’s thematic tourist circuits — will play valuable roles, acting as pillars of the Act East Policy, while simultaneously giving a fillip to the domestic economy.  From time immemorial, pluralism has held primacy in Indic thought. The knowledge that universalist philosophies can be debated on and experienced across ethnic and linguistic groups, yet be assimilated into the wider Indic fold, is ostensible not just within the boundaries of modern India, but also as far as Japan and the regions between. What enabled this is the fact that the abstract commitment of an individual to truth-based principles found humanisation within each community’s cultural crucible. A thread of unity weaves across Jambudvipa and Dvipantara — terms used for India and a group of Southeast Asian nations respectively — from the time of their earliest reference in the millennia-old Matsya Purana to the 13th century, when they prominently appeared in Javanese royal proclamations, and on until the present. This continuum has been characterised not by colonisation but by the empowerment of local communities on a foundation of Indic tenets in the spheres of spirituality, administration, architecture, literature and the arts, originally using Sanskrit as the lingua franca.  From Angkor Wat, Cambodia, to Taipei, Taiwan, and from Ayutthaya, Thailand, to Quang Nam, Vietnam, the apparent boundaries between Buddhism and Hinduism are evidently blurred. For many, both Lord Buddha and Lord Rama are expressed as manifestations of Lord Vishnu. In a similar vein, a vast pantheon of Hindu deities is venerated and epics are retold not only across the predominantly Buddhist region of mainland Southeast Asia, but also in Shinto-majority Japan and Muslim-majority Indonesia.  The Archaeological Survey of India has been active in Vietnam where, in May this year, it excavated a pristine monolithic Shiva Linga on the premises of the Mỹ Sơn temple complex. India’s relationship with Vietnam dates back over 2,000 years and the 60,000-strong Balamon Cham Hindu community in the Southeast Asian country continues the traditions of their ancestors. Meanwhile, defining the skyline of the Yogyakarta-Central Java border in Indonesia is the 9th-century Prambanan Compound, a 240-temple complex dedicated to Lord Shiva, hosting an array of motifs depicting the Ramayana. For communities from near and afar who explore India’s Ramayana and Buddhist circuits, the values India stands for get highlighted in perhaps a deeper way than through traditional diplomatic interactions.  Into the Hindi heartland  Tracing Lord Buddha’s footsteps on the civilisational map under the tourism ministry’s Swadesh Darshan Scheme, promoting tourist circuits, the Buddhist circuit’s rail route stretches from Lumbini, his birthplace, to Kushinagar, where he attained nirvana. Meanwhile, the Ramayana circuit covers Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama, weaving its way through 15 sites of importance across nine states, and ending in Rameshwaram, from where the Ramsetu Bridge extends to Sri Lanka.  Air connectivity is the key to the neighbourhood outreach plan. For this, international airports are being developed at Kushinagar and Ayodhya, the respective nodal centres of the Buddhist and Ramayana circuits. From the former, the sites of Kapilvastu and Sravasti, where Lord Buddha spent much of his monastic life, are easy to reach. The Ayodhya airport will provide access to the to-be-constructed Ram Mandir on the banks of the Sarayu while also connecting to nearby Nandigram, where, according to the Ramayana, Prince Bharat spent years as a caretaker-in-exile while Lord Rama was away. The Prayagraj airport will serve the pilgrimage destinations of Shringverpur and Chitrakoot, connecting to Madhya Pradesh’s Ram Van Gaman Path, which traces Lord Rama’s footsteps during his exile to the forest. Chhattisgarh has proposed a similar path, which is set to cover nine key locations, starting from Raipur.  Road improvements have already cut travel time by over 20 per cent on several routes through Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Buddhist circuit-specific $1.5 billion investment to improve infrastructure, land acquisition and road connectivity, along with a pooled 200-acre land bank, has given titans of the hospitality industry, such as The Oberoi Group and the IHG Group, adequate confidence to greenlight projects along the orbit. Additionally, many of the $1.1 billion city-wide infrastructure developments in Varanasi will make it easier for visitors to explore nearby Sarnath, the place where Lord Buddha gave his first sermon.  The World Bank, too, has stepped in, allocating $15 million for upgrading Sarnath’s pedestrian ways and roads linking over two dozen monasteries and heritage sites to the railway station. Japan is involved in the construction of Varanasi’s “Rudraksh” convention centre at a cost of $20 million. Built under the Kashi-Kyoto Partner City Agreement through the Japan International Cooperation Agency, it seeks to create a platform for cultural and knowledge exchange.  Bihar is not far behind in its plans, although it faces copious challenges to make the state conducive for increased tourist footfall. Bodhgaya, where Lord Buddha attained enlightenment, should undergo a facelift with chief minister Nitish Kumar’s push to turn it into a major hub of the circuit following the Union government’s construction of a 2,000-seat cultural convention centre. However, much needs to be done if Rajgir and Nalanda — ancient international seats of learning — figure prominently on Bihar’s tourist trail. Better waste management is also required to raise the sanitation standards of the nearest city, Gaya, which currently ranks the lowest out of 382 cities in the Central government’s Swachh Survekshan 2020 survey (ranking cities and towns on cleanliness) in the 1 lakh-10 lakh population category. In contrast, although on a different metric, Varanasi ranks the highest out of 46 cities along the Ganga, pointing to the growing disparity in development between the two regions. Gaya airport is yet to accommodate wide-bodied aircraft, and what should take an hour and a half on the 100-km NH-38 stretch to Patna currently takes nearly four hours. That said, the Ramayana circuit’s Sitamarhi, Buxar and Darbhanga, important sites associated with Goddess Sita, Maharishi Valmiki and King Janaka, are easily accessible from Patna and the hope is that these cities will gain from the hospitality infrastructure that is being laid out.  Regional hubs  With the systematic erasure of Buddhist heritage in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the world’s westernmost bastion of Buddhism is now Ladakh. Home to a plethora of monasteries, it offers visitors a window into Tibetan culture due to its historic linkages with Lhasa. These linkages extend through Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh and leveraging the Centre’s scheme for regional airports and low-cost flights to smaller towns to bring these areas within the broader Buddhist circuit can strengthen the AEP. The recently announced plan for setting up a Central University in Ladakh with a Centre for Buddhist Studies will be noteworthy in this context, especially if it were to provide scholarships to students and thought leaders from the Asean region. The Tibetan cause, long held captive by bureaucrats and governments, can be furthered organically. Empowering the community, highlighting the importance of monasteries including Tawang’s Gaden Namgyal Lhatse and Ladakh’s Thiksey, and bringing the Tibetan message to the world, are undoubtedly a part of India’s civilisational responsibility.  Transforming India’s frontier states into gateways for collaboration with its neighbours will also hasten the progress of the AEP’s trilateral highway project connecting Manipur — a Vaishnav stronghold with cultural similarities across the border — to Thailand via Myanmar. Besides facilitating tourist access to the Buddhist and Ramayana circuits, it stands to improve bilateral trade and act as a strategic counterbalance to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).  It is notable that much of the Hindu culture, literature and architecture seen to the country’s east has been influenced by South Indian empires that engaged extensively in both cultural exchange and trade. Broadly speaking, to support increased tourist footfall, Nasik, Nagpur, Bhadrachalam, Hampi and Rameshwaram have better infrastructure than their northern counterparts. Despite that, Bhadrachalam received $8 million from the Union government for developing its heritage sites, while the temple town of Hampi, associated with Kishkinda, is receiving $140 million from a private trust for building a temple complex and statue dedicated to Lord Hanuman. Interestingly, it is from here, according to the Ramayana, that Sugriva left for Jawadvipa (modern-day Java, Indonesia) in search of Sita. Going further south, pilgrims will reach Rameshwaram, from where the limestone bridge to Sri Lanka is visible.  The road ahead  While constitutional purists may argue that selective, government-driven religious revivalism could impinge upon the idea of secularism, there is a strong case for rebuilding cultural bridges with Southeast and East Asia from a commercial and foreign policy standpoint. Ably supported by quality infrastructure, hospitality and education, the economic benefits of religious tourism are estimated to be over $50 billion. As partnerships develop in the face of rising regional authoritarianism, reinvigorating age-old bonds between Jambudvipa and Dvipantara involves an astute awareness and comprehensive understanding of Indic liberalism. The benefit of cementing ties is not merely derived from an extension of India’s “arc of influence” and “soft power”, but from the value inherent in reviving 2,000 years of international interaction and confluence of liberal ideas, centred in India. History is replete with examples of how this has acted as a bulwark against anti-liberal, expansionist empires of yore.  Building on the cultural intersectionality with the nations in the neighbourhood, the Ramayana and Buddhist circuits will highlight the overarching themes of righteousness and Dharma, which are central to the lives of both Lord Rama and Lord Buddha. With India aspiring to take a leadership role in regional affairs, these circuits will act as pillars of strength and symbols of unity for the nation and its neighbours as the AEP evolves in the years ahead.

As the world strides forward in the search for an effective coronavirus vaccine, Southeast Asia is set to become the focus of outside powers eager to win the region’s support and neutralize China’s own efforts to claim the mantle of global public health leadership.  In the new game of “vaccine diplomacy,” in Southeast Asia and further afield, much of the early movements have been made by Beijing. Extending its earlier campaign of “mask diplomacy,” which saw it shower its Southeast Asian neighbors with masks and personal protective equipment to combat COVID-19, China and some of its top drug-makers have begun assuring the region of access to a successful Chinese vaccine.  On August 24, Premier Li Keqiang promised the lower Mekong countries — Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar — priority access to vaccines produced by Chinese companies. The following day, state-owned drug maker Sinovac announced that it had partnered with Indonesia’s PT Bio Farma to develop the distribution of a vaccine that is currently undergoing trials in the country. The Philippines has also been offered early access to a Chinese vaccine, and Malaysia is currently in negotiations for a similar arrangement.  Despite the recent assurances by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that any COVID-19 vaccines produced in China will be made available as “global public goods,” there are reasons for Southeast Asian governments to tread cautiously. Reports have suggested that Beijing could use the promise of access to extract concessions on important issues, from China’s controversial damming of the upper reaches of the Mekong River to its extensive maritime and territorial claims in the South China Sea.  Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter  Yet if the region is wary and agile in its approach to Chinese offers, it stands to benefit from the intense competition that Beijing’s campaign of “vaccine diplomacy” is likely to prompt. One sign of this emerged late last month, when the Australian government announced a $58 million injection into the GAVI international vaccine alliance, which helps coordinate the COVAX scheme designed to secure rapid and fair global access to COVID-19 vaccines.  Specifically, Canberra’s down payment was intended to ensure access to vaccines for Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Timor Leste, and Vietnam, in addition to eight Pacific Island nations. Coming a few days after Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed to help the nation’s “Pacific family” get access to a proven vaccine, the Australian commitment should be seen in the context of its growing consternation about China’s inroads in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.  Russia also recently approved the limited distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine, trollishly dubbed Sputnik V, after the Soviet satellite that beat the United States into orbit in 1957. Vietnam, which is also in the early stages of developing its own vaccine, has already committed to purchase up to 150 million doses of Sputnik V. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte also offered to have himself injected with the new Russian vaccine, despite the widespread skepticism about its safety and efficacy.  Despite all of its concerns about China’s growing clout in Southeast Asia, the United States has been slower off the mark. Last month, Duke University and the American pharmaceutical company Arcturus announced a partnership with Singapore to develop another vaccine (known as Lunar-Cov19), which is currently in its first phase of clinical trials. Another U.S. company developing a vaccine, Novavax, announced a deal in early August to partner with the Serum Institute of India. In general, however, the Trump administration has taken an “America First” approach to the COVID-19 vaccine question, while spurning multilateral forums like the World Health Organization that are trying to coordinate global access and distribution. Even as research labs based in the U.S. press forward with vaccine trials, Washington has turned its back on the global coalition fighting the disease.  Advertisement  Still, there is plenty of time for the U.S. to reverse course. As a recent commentary from the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed out, after a slow start in the provision of pandemic-related support to Southeast Asia, Washington quickly caught up with Beijing’s efforts. In June, Washington quadrupled its COVID-19 funding commitment to Southeast Asia from $18 million to $77 million, making it the largest individual donor country to the region, at least in terms of monetary value. All this suggests that the U.S., where pharmaceutical companies are currently trialing a number of potential vaccines, will eventually emerge as an important partner of Southeast Asian countries in their quest to secure access to the life-saving jabs.  As the world’s researchers close in on a lasting inoculation against the novel coronavirus, the Southeast Asian countries will likely come under pressure from China, the U.S., and other governments to “pick a side” in the game of competing vaccines. But they are also in a position to play these powers off against one another, thus spreading their risk and ensuring access to effective vaccines when they finally emerge. “Vaccine diplomacy” is a reminder that while geopolitical tensions carry undeniable risks for Southeast Asia, they also bring opportunities — if the region’s governments are canny enough to seize them."

For the first time, India and Bangladesh were in the “extreme risk” category, joining China and Myanmar in a group of 32 countries with the worst risk of slave labour, the Modern Slavery index by risk analytics company Verisk Maplecroft found.  The risks faced by workers in Cambodia and Vietnam also rose to their highest in four years, taking 32nd and 35th places in the ranking of 198 countries that identified North Korea, Yemen and Syria as the three worst nations for slave labour.  “What makes the situation even more alarming is that modern slavery risks are set to intensify as countries grapple with the economic fallout of the pandemic,” said Sofia Nazalya, a human rights analyst at Verisk Maplecroft.  “As more workers are pushed into the informal sector, they will be at greater risk of facing more exploitative forms of work, some of which could amount to forced labour conditions,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments.  Asian garment workers supplying global fashion brands lost up to $5.8bn (£4.4bn) in wages from March to May, the Clean Clothes Campaign pressure group said last month, as the Covid-19 pandemic led to store closures and cancelled orders.  About 60 million people work in Asia’s garment industry and falling sales have put many jobs at risk. Laid-off workers are likely to turn to exploitative jobs or may put their children to work to cope with the loss of earnings, industry experts say.  “Even in the same jobs, the conditions have become more exploitative,” said Apoorva Kaiwar, regional secretary for South Asia at IndustriALL Global Union, a federation that represents workers in 140 countries.  “Our affiliates have reported wage cuts in existing jobs as well as removal of facilities such as transport and canteen with subsidised food. For those who have lost jobs, they are unable to find jobs with comparable wages and benefits.”  Travel restrictions and measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19 have made it harder for companies to carry out audits to ensure ethical working practices in their supply chains, said the slavery index, which aims to help businesses identify risk.  “The reputational risk to brands from association with modern slavery is ... now higher than at any other time over recent years,” said Ms Nazalya."

He insisted on the urgency of the quarantine, then chastised those Peruvians who disregarded it and the local authorities who didn’t enforce it “with the strictness this situation requires.” … In the next few days, TV news showed images of residents on their apartment balconies cheering on police and public health enforcers in the streets. … Peru’s swift shutdown of intercity travel is likely to help reduce the spread of the virus. The government’s actions, the nation’s solidarity and seriousness of its approach have raised our hopes that the quarantine will expire as planned on March 31, and the disaster will be controlled enough to permit limited travel for folks like us to return home. … At least the measures here mesh with the lessons The New York Times drew from a study of Italy, the new epicenter of the virus: “that steps to isolate the coronavirus and people’s movement need to be put in place early, with absolute clarity, then strictly enforced.” U.S. infections have surged each day yet the federal government has remained reluctant to impose drastic actions. Other countries such as Italy and Spain have enforced quarantines, but too late to stop COVID-19 from ravaging them. … When we do get out, what scares us most is the life we may encounter when we get to the U.S.  From June, Christian Science Monitor:  Peru set a global example of quick action in the face of COVID-19, implementing a nationwide lockdown March 16, soon after its first confirmed case. The government invested in respirators and hospital beds, and offered bonuses to medical professionals. It designed an economic relief package that not only offered low-interest loans to businesses and helped employers keep workers on payrolls, but also targeted the poor, vulnerable, and self-employed with vital cash transfers.  In other words, the country did everything right thanks to effective leadership. However…  Despite Peru’s lauded response efforts, it now [in June] has one of the world’s longest lockdowns, and the second-highest tally of COVID-19 cases in Latin America, with more than 264,000 cases and more than 8,000 people killed. In the region, Peru ranks only behind Brazil, which has taken a decidedly less deliberate approach to halting the pandemic. Where things went wrong, experts say, was in misunderstanding the dynamics of poverty in a country that has gained “middle-income” status over two decades of growth.  Peru took the same kind of muscular action that was credited with keeping Covid-19 deaths in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam to 0. But the virus went in a different direction in Peru, suggesting that humans do not control the virus. The WHO dashboard shows Peru having the world’s highest COVID-19 death rate, having surpassed (female-led) Belgium, Spain, the UK, Chile, the wicked scoffers in Brazil, the unfortunate Italians, the wicked Swedes with their anti-lockdown anti-mask MD/PhDs, and we Americans, so sorely lacking in the national leadership that would intimidate the virus.  Peru has had a lot of problems with drug-resistant tuberculosis. Maybe it is a place where microbes infecting the lungs happens to flourish?  Readers: What do we know about Peru right now? Can it be said that the God of Shutdown is a fickle god and is punishing truly righteous Peruvians for reasons that we will never understand?  Related:"

Extra! brings us more news on abuses of power at all different levels of the criminal justice system. We also take another look at some of the situations we’ve been following in Belarus, Ethiopia, and the Uighur detention camps in China, and an update on the climate crisis and the pandemic.  How the People in Power Abuse It to Avoid Responsibility  Breonna Taylor’s ex-boyfriend: Plea deal tried to get me to falsely incriminate her  Himani: As we covered previously, Breonna Taylor was killed in her sleep by police. There are so many utterly fucked up things that created this devastating tragedy, from the illegal no-knock warrant to the glossed over history of misconduct of the officers involved to the continued lack of accountability. Taylor’s murder has shed light on so many aspects of the criminal justice system that exist entirely to uphold the current structures of power and, ultimately, white supremacy.  And here we have the latest. As Natalie has covered here before, cops are notorious liars. And they tried to get Taylor’s ex-boyfriend to corroborate their lies so they could cover up the fact that three officers murdered her. As Ben Crump, the civil rights lawyer representing Taylor’s family, observed in a statement:  “This is why the Black community has no trust in America’s justice system. It’s enormously ironic that the accused drug dealer here acted with honor, refusing to falsely discredit Bre after her death — even when offered the temptation of no prison time for lying, while prosecutors and police acted in the most egregiously dishonest and dishonorable way possible.”  Natalie: This is the state trying to excuse their egregious and deadly behavior. It’s so despicable.  Appeals court lifts order reining in feds in Portland  Natalie: I just want to note that the two judges that lifted the injunction — which thwarted efforts to shield police actions from view — are both Trump appointees: Eric Miller and Daniel Bress. As I’ve noted in this space before, this administration’s reshaping of the American judiciary will haunt us for years… and for that reason alone, I hope we aren’t faced with another four years of his picks.  But this goes beyond the White House: Miller’s presence on the federal bench is the direct result of the erosion of norms in the Mitch McConnell-led Senate. His nomination was pushed through despite a long-standing, bipartisan Senate tradition known as the “blue slip,” which allows home state senators to put a hold on a nomination. Miller’s nomination earned a hearing and Senate approval over the strong objections of his home state Senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell.  Prosecutor Fights Cop’s ‘Bad Faith’ Bid To Usurp Authority In Confederate Statue Cases  Press Conference:  “It’s wrong to target our leaders, particularly our African- American leaders. This is about justice!”  – Lt. Gov. @FairfaxJustin @WAVY_News pic.twitter.com/Bm9f0kD3I1 — Kiahnna Patterson (@KPattersonWAVY) September 4, 2020  Natalie: We’ve been watching this story unfold in the last few weeks here in “Extra! Extra!” and everytime I think this story can’t possibly get any crazier, it absolutely does. Because today, as the Portsmouth courts hosted arraignments for the black leaders, including a sitting state senator, NAACP leaders, and city public defenders, the city’s police chief was ousted. The ouster may be temporary — it’s for 30 days with pay, according to another news reports — as the city investigates the handling of the Confederate monument case.  To be clear, the Police Chief should, at the very least, be suspended, without pay, for allowing the officer in the case, Kevin McGee, to file spurious charges when she knew he was the subject of an Internal Affairs investigation. But I do wonder: how is it that Kevin McGee has now forced not one but two black women from their perch as police commissioner but he still has a job? Qwhite interesting.  Republican senator, swarmed by protesters after Trump speech, calls for FBI probe  Natalie: The idea that someone who owes their political success to the Tea Party would complain about how crowds are behaving is laughable.  What Law Enforcement Actually Does  LASD Whistleblower Says Deputy Who Shot Andres Guardado Was Trying to Join Compton Station Deputy Gang  Natalie: We hear from politicians on both sides of the aisle that there are “good cops” and there are “bad cops” but, as we take in these stories, I keep wondering: “where are these good cops I keep hearing so much about?”  Even in this story, I want to celebrate Deputy Art Gonzalez and the three other whistleblowers who have come forward with stories about the “violent clique” inside the Compton Sheriff’s station, but I’m stuck wondering how a gang sprung up in a sheriff’s department and it took this long for anyone to say anything. It took Andres Guardado being gunned down for anyone to say something.  “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,” the old saying goes but if you’re on the sidelines, watching evil happen and doing or saying nothing, you are no longer one of the good men; you are as evil as those that tattoo “Executioners” on their skin.  Rachel: Would like to second Natalie in my gratitude to Art Gonzalez and the other whistleblowers; I’m frustrated by the reality of how little is often done in response to whistleblower testimony (especially given the grave personal and professional risks to whistleblowers of doing so), and at the same time am enormously grateful for what their risks provide us with; incontrovertible and contextualized evidence of the systems of harm we’re working against. I think it’s useful for us to think about how best to value and act on this kind of testimony; when someone has done the work to try to act as a ‘good cop’ and divest from and publicly expose the violence they were party to, what’s the most effective and powerful ways we can use that information to enact change? We have to ask ourselves that because the unfortunate truth is that the information being out there on its own won’t make a difference; we are seeing in countless ways right now that it takes a great deal of concerted effort, not just intention or awareness, to really shift things.  In thinking about this I’m reminded of an infamous Village Voice scoop, “The NYPD Tapes“: “Two years ago, a police officer in a Brooklyn precinct became gravely concerned about how the public was being served. To document his concerns, he began carrying around a digital sound recorder, secretly recording his colleagues and superiors… They reveal that precinct bosses threaten street cops if they don’t make their quotas of arrests and stop-and-frisks, but also tell them not to take certain robbery reports in order to manipulate crime statistics. The tapes also refer to command officers calling crime victims directly to intimidate them about their complaints.” I revisited the piece this week because I couldn’t remember when, exactly, the story had come out, and what impact it had had. This piece was published in the Village Voice in 2010, a full decade ago; as you likely know, stop and frisk did not end ten years ago; police intimidation and coercion of data and information hoarding/manipulation, even just in the NYPD, is arguably more prevalent than ever. I say this not to discount the brave and necessary actions of the NYPD officer who made that story possible, but to remind the rest of us that we owe it to the whistleblowers here and more importantly, to Andres Guardado, to make sure we take action on this reveal.  Dana Larsen: Top antiprostitution cop was abusing sex workers  Rachel: I keep starting to try to say something about this and stopping and starting again – partially because (as I know we all are, and most of you much more deeply than I, I know) I’m so tired, and the events of the past few weeks (months/years) have somewhat left me at a loss for words. But also because it feels challenging to even start to untangle the threads of interlocking forms of violence that are happening here – I guess maybe the most important thing to say is that there’s absolutely nothing shocking or ironic about this; “antiprostitution” policing, this man’s official and state-approved job, was already categorically abusive to sex workers; as we are all in the process of learning in a very hands-on way, police power is inherently about control & power over civilians, not about protecting or serving them; and as has been well documented, gender-based violence and abuse (as is generally a side effect of near-absolute power) is also rampant among police forces. Sex workers, especially Black and/or trans sex workers and street-based and/or drug using sex workers, live at the nexus of all these truths. This is I guess a long way of trying to say what I am so often saying in this column, a variation on ‘cruelty is the point’ and ‘the system isn’t broken, this is the system working as it was meant to:’ this isn’t a shocking aberration from the role police are supposed to play when it comes to sex work; criminalization of sex workers is about facilitating exactly this situation.  Police watchdog would be silenced under Baltimore scanner encryption plan  Nine Boston Police Officers Arrested for Overtime Fraud Scheme  D.C. crackdown on gun crime targeted Black wards, was not enforced citywide as announced  And More Accounts of Police Brutality  A Black man pinned to the ground by NY police died two months before George Floyd  Natalie: There is an outcry about this as another example of police brutality and, of course, that outcry is warranted, but one thing I don’t want overlooked in all of this: Daniel Prude’s brother called the police for help. His brother’s quoted as saying, “I placed a phone call for my brother to get help, not to get lynched.”  Los Angeles: sheriff’s deputies fatally shoot Black man stopped for riding bicycle  Himani: So this is horrifying, as is every account of police brutality. So many things about this are just wrong. But as someone who does not own a car and whose primary mode of transit is walking, this news hits a really particular spot with me. On a daily basis I witness multiple instances of drivers breaking the law and nobody bats an eye. If I call them out on it I get yelled at or worse. I have seen cars park and stop and completely block bike lanes. I have seen cops do all this and more. And, few people, including law enforcement, are actually aware of what the traffic laws on the books are.  An extensive Propublica analysis from a few years ago proved that, not only do law enforcement officers not know what the traffic laws actually are, but they use them to disproportionately target Black and Latinx people. And that’s the thing: Black, immigrant and Native American households are the latest likely to own cars, therefore relying on other modes of transit like… riding a bicycle, to go about their days.  So to see this all come together in this way in the murder of Dijon Kizzee is incredibly heartbreaking. There are already so many things, so so many things working against anyone who is trying to just get by as a pedestrian or a cyclist, even though — as far as this planet is concerned — it is the only socially responsible thing to do (more on this below). And then to add on top of it the very real threat of getting shot at by the police because you’re a Black person riding a bicycle — it’s really upsetting beyond words.  And Still, with the Police Reform  Chicago Police Will Now Get Free Mental Health Care, City Says  Himani: On the one hand, I do think that law enforcement officials would benefit from mental health care. On the other, I think everyone would benefit from mental health care. The fact that this is how Chicago is opting to spend its limited resources — ie putting more money in the police budget — is just appalling. Instead of the city footing the bill for police officers’ mental health this undisclosed amount of money could be invested in the community by providing more funding for community health centers and public schools. I mean, it is unfortunate that there’s been this surge in suicides in the police department, but there are so many public health crises facing Chicago right now, not least among them police brutality. Policy moves like this send clear messages as to whose concerns and whose wellbeing and, ultimately, whose lives matter.  Rachel: There’s so much to be outraged about that like, in some ways why spend neurons on this, but on the other hand, it is so infuriating on a limbic system level to see these resources being provided to police when so many low-income folks are working day and night to provide extremely bare-bones mental health support to Black queer & trans folks during this impossible, unbearable time. Anyways, what a great day to donate to the Nina Pop Mental Health Recovery Fund if you have the means!  NYPD’s New “Discipline Matrix” Would Recommend, For The First Time, Specific Penalties For Misconduct  Himani: This is again one of those situations where I’m like, “well, it’s like a quarter of a step in the right direction.” I mean, first of all the fact that they didn’t have a discipline matrix previously is a little bit appalling. But at the end of the day, the NYPD Commissioner makes the decision about whether or not to issue the recommended punishments and penalties or to simply ignore them. As Michael Sisitzky of the New York Civil Liberties Union observed, “The NYPD has rarely taken it upon themselves to enforce discipline for misconduct in the past.”  And, Christopher Robbins writing for The Gothamist notes, the matrix does little for the problem of police lying. Which, I feel like I can’t say this enough, is a real fucking problem.  Because There Truly Is Nothing More Important to Do Right Now  Exclusive: GOP Senators Ask the FDA to Classify the Abortion Pill as Dangerous  Himani: So they can’t and won’t figure out a meaningful Coronavirus Relief Package but they have the time to find more ways to police the bodies of people with uteruses. Natalie said this in the context of a different situation but I think it applies here as well: “Small government conservatism being proven for the farce that it is!”  A Quaker School Promoted Liberal Values. Then Its Teachers Unionized.  Natalie: We’ve seen this happen far too often to count: group espouses liberal values but ultimately refuses to live up to them when asked.  Rachel: I agree with Natalie, of course, and as someone also who was raised a liberal Quaker, this rings true to me as a problem endemic to both modern Quakerism and liberalism: the abstract values espoused by a group are one thing, but actually materially executing them in terms of shifts in our communities and looking at how those abstract values map onto the ground-level concrete is another, and that second step is often a real hurdle. In the Quaker communities I grew up in, peace and pacifism were of course core values in terms of very high-level ideals like “stopping war” or “no nukes,” but no conversations were had around the violence of poverty or incarceration or police violence or how we could work for peace in those contexts. Similarly, equality and truth are core Quaker values, both of which unions uphold and defend — but here we are!  US imposes sanctions on top international criminal court officials  Himani: It’s news like this that makes me feel like: no wonder law enforcement in America will do everything they can to avoid accountability for their actions because clearly that is the modus operandi of the country as a whole…  Important News from Around the World  Belarus authorities strip accreditation from foreign journalists  Natalie: I must admit, I’ve been feverishly consuming the news coming out of Belarus for fear that it portends America’s future: a rigged presidential re-election for Alexander Lukashenko, widespread condemnation and calls for a new election from countries around the globe, fervent civilian protests met by met by state-sanctioned violence, an internet shutdown and now this: the stripping of accreditation from foreign journalists.  The BBC responded to the actions, saying, “We believe it is vital for the people of Belarus to have access to impartial, independent information about events in their country,” but surely that information is also vital to leaders across the world who are considering sending in human rights monitors and imposing new sanctions. The world requires impartial and independent information as well.  Comrade Duch, Khmer Rouge chief executioner, dies in Cambodia  Himani: Duch’s death is pretty monumental because of his role in the mass killings that happened in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge regime’s power. Like so many atrocities that have happened and continue to happen around the world, it’s hard to imagine the people who decided to commit those atrocities. Like seeing Derek Chauvin’s knee on George Floyd’s neck, like seeing Daniel Pantaleo strangling Eric Garner, like seeing multiple officers pin down Daniel Prude until he died — how do you just decide, “today I will torture someone and then send them to be killed, and I will do it again and again and again and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow through the foreseeable future.” It’s incredible — and horrifying, mostly horrifying — the things people will do in order to secure their own power, their own position above another person.  What They Saw: Ex-Prisoners Detail The Horrors Of China’s Detention Camps  Natalie: So much for “never again?”  Abe Shinzo, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, steps down over health concerns  Himani: Sometimes, it can be incredibly difficult to understand the significance of something that’s happened in another country when you lack the connection or the context. I’m really not sure what to say about this. Abe did a lot while he was in power, he changed a lot, for better or for worse, and the ramifications of that will be felt for years to come. At the same time, the conservative party he is part of will maintain its rule and continue the policies that preceded his tenure as Prime Minister.  Ethiopia falls into violence a year after leader’s Nobel peace prize win  Himani: This is another incredibly fraught situation where it’s hard to know what exactly is going on. Like who is responsible for all these deaths of Oromo activists? It’s hard to say, but the government’s response… leaves something to be desired, to say the least. It’s hard not to feel like this situation in Ethiopia is starting to go in the direction of Myanmar under nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi’s leadership…  The Climate Crisis  “It just looks like a bomb went off:” Louisianians on recovering from Hurricane Laura  Natalie: It’s so dispiriting how quickly our news cycle moves now… usually, a hurricane the size and strength of Laura would’ve merited wall-to-wall coverage. Those news reports would be overflowing with human interest stories that make the disaster less about the physical destruction and more about resilience, grief and finding joy in the worst moments. Anderson Cooper would’ve been on the ground in Louisiana. Some waders-wearing reporter would’ve told the story of a daring rescue while standing in flood waters. As hokey as those stories sound, they are often what spurn our fellow citizens to action…and it’s how relief organizations fill their coffers. But, with the pandemic and the upcoming election taking up all the oxygen in the room, the stories of those impacted by Hurricane Laura and Tropical Storm Marco go largely unheard.  As of this writing, Hurricane Laura has claimed 24 lives and given that 200,000 people are still without power in Louisiana — just as the Bayou State’s heat and humidity reach its annual peak — I expect that number to go up. If you can spare money to support relief efforts, please consider doing so…Charity Navigator has a list of vetted organizations working to help storm victims recover.  Amazon tragedy repeats itself as Brazil rainforest goes up in smoke  Himani: I’ll be honest. I read this headline and I did not have the heart to read this article. And yet this feels like incredibly important news that I didn’t see covered anywhere else.  The appallingly bad neoclassical economics of climate change  Himani: I really can’t say I’m surprised by this, exactly. Last year, Andrew Simms wrote an op-ed in The Guardian that observed that a lauded economic model allowed for global temperature increases of 3 degrees Celsius — a rise in temperatures that would cause unimaginable devastation in the world and probably make it largely uninhabitable. As Simms wrote at the time, “For anyone outside economics that might seem bewildering, but the blase disregard of the economy being a wholly owned, and utterly dependent, subsidiary of the biosphere is perfectly symbolic.”  And well, here we are, with further evidence that economics is bullshit. Steve Keen, the author of the current article repudiating the work of that same lauded economist, writes of the economic models being applied to climate change: “‘making up numbers to support a pre-existing belief.'”  How SUVs conquered the world – at the expense of its climate  Himani: I’m not sure why it would come as a surprise to anyone that SUVs are horrible for the environment and the climate. They’re also horrible because they kill pedestrians and cyclists at appalling rates. And yet, as with so many things in America, no matter the consequences, we gotta have our big, gas guzzling murder machines because they sure are convenient!  E.P.A. Relaxes Rules Limiting Toxic Waste From Coal Plants  COVID-19 Update  FEMA Says It Will Stop Paying For Cloth Face Masks For Schools  Natalie: The federal government will urge public schools across the country to return, despite all evidence indicating that it’s not safe for the students, teachers or the families they return home to…but now they want to shirk on the responsibility of providing reusable cloth face masks for students?! This is deplorable.  U.S. says it won’t join WHO-linked effort to develop, distribute coronavirus vaccine  Rachel: I’m thinking of these stories — which are familiar to us all now, as they bring further evidence of the now-clear reality that the US federal government is largely abandoning its citizens during this pandemic, and in particular has decided that Black and brown citizens dying is an acceptable loss — in line with the “suckers and losers” Trump scandal from above. Not because I’m interested in pinning the federal failure entirely on Trump as a person, we have to be clear-eyed about the fact that it goes much deeper than that, but because it’s a moment where it’s so clear that Trump’s personally warped ideology is one expression of the GOP’s underlying philosophy: that some human life is valuable, but much is not; that one has to earn the privilege of being allowed to live, or even mourned after death, and many of us haven’t. It can feel impossible to process or conceptualize how such harmful and generationally catastrophic decisions are being made, but honestly when you keep in mind the paradigm that says some of our lives are worth it but most aren’t, and that designation can change at any time depending on our utility or profit, they become pretty chillingly clear!

Facebook Moves to Limit Election Chaos in November  Himani: This is far too little, far too late."

The risks faced by workers in Cambodia and Vietnam also rose to their highest in four years, taking 32nd and 35th places in the ranking of 198 countries which identified North Korea, Yemen and Syria as the three worst nations for slave labour.  ""What makes the situation even more alarming is that modern slavery risks are set to intensify as countries grapple with the economic fallout of the pandemic,"" said Sofia Nazalya, a human rights Analyst at Verisk Maplecroft.  ""As more workers are pushed into the informal sector, they will be at greater risk of facing more exploitative forms of work, some of which could amount to forced labour conditions,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments.  Asian garment workers supplying global fashion brands lost up to $5.8 billion in wages from March to May, the Clean Clothes Campaign pressure group said last month, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to store closures and cancelled orders.  About 60 million people work in Asia's garment industry and falling sales have put many jobs at risk. Laid-off workers are likely to turn to exploitative jobs or may put their children to work to cope with the loss of earnings, industry experts say.  ""Even in the same jobs, the conditions have become more exploitative,"" said Apoorva Kaiwar, Regional Secretary for South Asia at IndustriALL Global Union, a federation that represents workers in 140 countries.  ""Our affiliates have reported wage cuts in existing jobs as well as removal of facilities such as transport and canteen with subsidised food. For those who have lost jobs, they are unable to find jobs with comparable wages and benefits.""  Travel restrictions and measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have made it harder for companies to carry out audits to ensure ethical working practices in their supply chains, said the slavery index, which aims to help businesses identify risk.  ""The reputational risk to brands from association with modern slavery is ... now higher than at any other time over recent years,"" said Nazaly"

Distance covered will be 93 km through river Gumti or Gomati.  The route will connect Tripura with Bangladesh using the inland waterways for the first time.  It will greatly enhance connectivity between Bangladesh and the North Eastern states of India boosting bilateral trade with Bangladesh.  The opening of the new route follows the signing of the 2nd addendum to the Protocol for Inland Water Trade & Transit (PIWTT) in May 2020 which opened two new routes.  Do you know?  The PIWTT was signed between India and Bangladesh in 1972 to connect the two countries through inland waterways.  Part of: GS Prelims and GS-III- Energy resources  In news  The Union Coal Ministry organised a webinar on Coal Gasification and Liquefaction recently.  Key takeaways  India aims for 100 million tonnes (MT) coal gasification by 2030 with investments worth over Rs. 4 lakh crores, said Pralhad Joshi, Union Minister of Coal and Mines.  For encouraging use of clean sources of fuel, the government has provided for a concession of 20% on revenue share of coal used for gasification.  This will boost production of synthetic natural gas, energy fuel, and urea for fertilisers and production of other chemicals.  Do you know?  For development of Surface Coal Gasification in India, a Steering Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Dr. V.K. Saraswat, Member, NITI Aayog comprising members from the Ministry of Coal.  CIL has also planned to set up at least 3 gasification plants (besides Dankuni) on BOO basis (Build-Own-Operate) through global tendering and has signed an MOU with GAIL for marketing synthetic natural gas.  Important value additions  Coal gasification  It is the process of producing syngas—a mixture consisting primarily of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, natural gas, and water vapour —from coal and water, air and/or oxygen.  Coal liquefaction  It is a process of converting coal into liquid hydrocarbons: liquid fuels and petrochemicals.  Part of: GS Prelims and GS-II- Centre-state Relations; Policies and interventions  In news  Recently, the Punjab Assembly passed a resolution and rejected the Centre’s recent farm ordinances and the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020.  Key takeaways  The ordinances include:  Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020  Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020  Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020.  These ordinances are expected to allow free movement of agricultural produce between states and let the farmers decide to whom they want to sell their crops.  The Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020 centralizes the power sector through establishment of Electricity Contract Enforcement Authority.  Recognition of franchisees and sub- licensees under the Bill might open the sector to private players.  Punjab’s Stand:  Entry 14 of List II of the Constitution comprises agriculture as the subject of the states.  Therefore, the three ordinances passed by the Centre are against the Constitution of India.  These ordinances are a direct encroachment upon the functions of the states and against the spirit of cooperative federalism enshrined in the Constitution.  Important value additions  Article 246 adopts a threefold distribution of legislative power between the Union and the states.  The subject-wise distribution of this power is given in the three lists of the Seventh Schedule of the constitution:  List-I- the Union List  List-II- the State List  List-III- the Concurrent List  Part of: GS Prelims and GS-II- Judiciary; Education  In news  The Supreme Court ruled that the states are empowered under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DM Act) to override University Grants Commission (UGC) exam guidelines in order to protect human lives amid the Covid-19 pandemic.  Key takeaways  It held that universities and other institutions of higher education will have to conduct the final-year exams and cannot promote students on the basis of internal assessment or other criteria.  In case of a disaster, the priority of all authorities under the DM Act is to immediately combat the disaster and contain it to save human life.  In future, if any State found it impossible to conduct the exams by the deadline given by UGC and wanted to postpone them, it could apply to the UGC.  The States and universities cannot dismiss UGC guidelines as being merely advisory.  SC rejected the argument that compelling attendance by holding physical examination is a violation of the ‘Right to Life’ under Article 21.  Part of: GS Prelims and GS-III- Energy resources; Renewable sources of Energy  In news  On the 6th Foundation Day (27th August 2020) of the Association of Renewable Energy Agencies of States (AREAS), the government has launched a website and telephone directory for AREAS.  Important value additions  AREAS  Agenda Behind AREAS : State Nodal Agencies (SNAs) for Renewable Energy (RE) interact and learn from each other’s experiences and also share their best practices and knowledge regarding technologies and schemes/programmes.  Members : The Union Minister for New & Renewable Energy (NRE) is the Patron of the Association and Secretary, MNRE is the ex-officio President of the Association. All SNAs are members of the Association.  Formation : It got registered under Society Registration Act, 1860 on 27th August 2014.  Part of: GS Prelims and GS-III- Entrepreneurship; Innovation  In news  A brochure featuring Entrepreneurs in Residence (EIR) was recently launched.  Launched under: National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI) programme.  Concerned department: Department of Science & Technology (DST) Secretary.  The brochure details what the EIRs are working on and some highlights about them.  It is also meant to be a directory of all EIRs.  Important value additions  NIDHI supports aspiring entrepreneurs for pursuing a promising technology business idea over a period up to 18 months with a subsistence grant up to Rs 30000 per month with a maximum cap for total support of Rs 3.6 lakh to each EIR over a maximum of 18 months.  The NIDHI-EIR programme provides tremendous opportunities for innovative entrepreneurs to expand their networks and get critical feedback on their ventures in order to promote their entrepreneurial career goals and aspirations.  Part of: GS Prelims and GS-II- Global Groupings; International relations & GS-III – Trade  In news  Recently, the 8th East Asia Summit Economic Ministers’ Meeting (EAS-EMM) was held virtually.  Attended by: 10 ASEAN members and eight other nations, including India, the USA, and China.  Key takeaways  The importance of strengthening regional supply chains to make them resilient in times of Covid-19 pandemic and to increase economic growth was highlighted.  Any trade-restrictive emergency measures put in place to address the impact of Covid-19 must be consistent with the WTO rules.  They must not create unnecessary barriers to trade.  Support for the necessary reforms in the WTO was also discussed.  Facilitating the essential movement of people across borders.  Commitment to facilitate supply chain connectivity and inclusion of essential goods.  Harness the opportunities of the digital economy to overcome the challenges posed by restricted movement.  Important value additions  East Asia Summit  It was established in 2005.  It is a forum of 18 regional leaders for strategic dialogue and cooperation on the key political, security, and economic challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region.  India is one of the founding members of the East Asia Summit.  Membership : ASEAN members and 8 other countries namely Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and USA.

Challenges to Education Sector due to Pandemic  Suspension of Learning Centres : Most schools and colleges campuses will be closed through 2020 due to an increasing number of COVID cases. This could even extend to 2021.  Safety and security of students, teachers and staff will be challenging whenever educational institutes reopen  Increased Maintenance Cost : Schools and Colleges need to ensure hygiene to check the COVID-19 spread and this involves increased usage of disinfectants and sanitizers  Redesign Classrooms : Some of the educational institutes have started online classes to ensure continuum of learning. When these institutes reopen they need to upgrade their school digital infrastructure to deal effectively with future such breaks  Financial Difficulties : Institutes are finding it difficult to pay teachers without students and parents are finding tough to pay fees without work  The answer to the education crisis during the pandemic has been to offer online education. However, there are serious issues related to it, some of which are  Internet Access : It is estimated that only about 25 per cent of Indian households have an internet facility. For rural households, that number drops to 15 per cent.  Teacher Training: Teachers are not adequately trained to impart education through online mediums.  Underprepared : Government schools and colleges do not have the resources to provide digital education.  Regulation : In India there is lack of a proper policy on digital education, infrastructure and multiple languages.  Parenting Issues : Additional burden on parents to ensure that their Children attend the online classes and this impacts the productivity of their work  Students Discipline : There is inadequate space and peace at home for students to concentrate on learning.  Logistical Issues : Digital education requires uninterrupted broadband connectivity for several hours a day  Lacks Holistic Approach : Digital education is not about videos of lectures on blackboards by teachers on the internet. It is about appropriate platforms, technology, tools, interactivity, curation, content and a lot more.  Government Initiatives in past to help digital education  NOFN — National Optical Fibre Network (Now called Bharat Network )  The objective of this programme is to connect all 2,50,000 panchayats at the cost of over Rs 40,000 crore  It was conceptualised as a bulk broadband common infrastructure for the country. Overlaying education and health services up to panchayats and villages was an important component of the strategy.  It has reached many rural areas telecom operators did not want to serve due to lack of profitability. The Universal Service Obligation (USO) fund was used to build NOFN.  However, the NOFN is still not completely operational, after almost eight year  National Knowledge Network (NKN)  The NKN was established as a high bandwidth, low latency network to connect all knowledge-creating organisations comprising IITs, IIMs, universities, research labs and other e-governance institutions up to the district level.  It was aimed at encouraging collaborative development and building a repository of knowledge in all fields.  This network exists and is fully functional.  However, only a few institutions take full advantage of it because of a lack of understanding, local facilities, funding and technical expertise.  Way Ahead  The driving force behind NOFN and NKN was to build an IT-based teaching system, which could address the shortage of quality teachers and school infrastructure at the bottom of the economic pyramid  There is need to relook at the NOFN and make it a core component of digital education ecosystem of our country.  Connecting the dots:  POLITY/ GOVERNANCE  Topic: General Studies 2: Parliament and State legislatures—structure, functioning, conduct of business, powers & privileges and issues arising out of these.  Context: The Union Government has announced that in the forthcoming session of Parliament (monsoon session that starts on September 14) there will be no Question Hour. The stated reason for this is the situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic  What is Parliamentary Form of Government?  A parliamentary form of government in the one in which the executive is accountable to the electorate through a legislature which in turn is periodically elected by the electorate.  This accountability lies at the heart of democratic government and is implemented through procedures put in place by the legislature whose functions include Lawmaking Controlling the national finances Approving taxation proposals Having discussions on matters of public interest and concern  Each of these functions is discharged, daily or periodically, during sittings of the legislature and cover questions, adjournment motion, calling attention, half-an-hour discussion, motion of no confidence, questions of privilege, etc  What is Question Hour?  The first hour of every parliamentary sitting is slotted for the Question Hour where Members of Parliament raise questions about any aspect of administrative activity.  In a starred question , a member seeks an oral answer from the concerned minister and this can be followed by supplementary questions, whereas in the case of unstarred questions, a written answer is provided, and no supplementary question can be asked  Short notice question is one that is asked by giving a notice of less than ten days. It is answered orally.  Ministries receive the questions 15 days in advance so that they can prepare their ministers for Question Hour .  The presiding officers of the both Houses (Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha) are the final authority with respect to the conduct of Question Hour.  Question Hour is regulated according to parliamentary rules  Question Hour in both Houses is held on all days of the session . But there are two days when an exception is made (Day of President’s address & During Budget presentation)  With the broadcasting of Question Hour since 1991, Question Hour has become one the most visible aspects of parliamentary functioning  Significance of Question Hour  Instrument of Accountability : During the Question hour, Members of Parliament (MPs) ask questions to ministers and hold them accountable for the functioning of their ministries.  Regularity : The daily ‘Question Hour’ has an unmatched criticality on account of its regularity and its availability on a basis of equality to every Member of the House, Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha.  Broad Scope : It has a special significance in the proceedings of Parliament since it covers every aspect of government activity, domestic and foreign.  Leads to Wider Debate: Though questions are pointed & specific, our parliamentary history records instances of answers given to questions leading to wider debates, inquiries, and even administrative scandals.  Public Awareness : The information made available through Question Hour adds to public information essential to informed debates on matters of interest or concern.  Stance of Executive: The advantage of Question Hour to the government is that its position in the matter is authoritatively explained  What is the criticism of government’s move to suspend Question Hour?  Reduced Space for Opposition : The rest of the business of Houses was tightly controlled and set by the government, leaving only Question Hour to hold the government accountable.  Against the Spirit of Democracy: Suspension of Question Hour is not good sign in democratic principles especially in a parliamentary democracy.  Bad Precedence: Parliament is the beacon of legislative functioning and its functioning will set the precedent for Vidhan sabhas to follow in the future.  Lacks Consensus: The move to suspend Question Hour due to pandemic and to find alternate options was not discussed with leaders of political parties and groups  How has government responded to above criticisms?  The government has later clarified that the Unstarred Questions will continue to be received and answered and that the change will relate only to Starred Questions and the Supplementary questions emanating from them that require to be answered orally.  Conclusion  The test of a functioning democracy is its ability to face crises — social, economic, political — and seek correctives premised on institutions of democracy. A resort to what has been called ‘the politics of avoidance’ does not help the process.  Value Addition  Zero Hour  Zero Hour is an Indian parliamentary innovation. It is not mentioned in the parliamentary rules book.  Under this, MPs can raise matters without any prior notice.  The zero hour starts immediately after the question hour and lasts until the agenda for the day (i.e. regular business of the House) is taken up.  In other words, the time gap between the question hour and the agenda is known as zero hour.

There are 334 million acres of arable land, of which roughly 37 million acres are non cultivable.Since 1949, China lost one fifth of its arable land to urbanisation and industrialisation and currently only about 10 to 15 per cent of the land is left good for agriculture (compared to 1 percent in Saudi Arabia, 50 percent in India, 20 percent in the United States, and 32 percent in France).There is 545,960 square kilometres of irrigated land in China and about 40 per cent of China's crop land is irrigated. The average yield per acre in China is high as China uses more fertilizer that any other country in the world.The mismatch between agricultural (grain) supply and demand in China, is high. China has struggled to feed its 1.4 billion people, amidst recurrent natural calamities (floods, draughts), shrinking arable land, severe water shortages, depleting workforce, etc. China estimates that by 2030, when its population is expected to reach 1.5 billion, it will need to produce an additional 100 million tons of food grains each year.As per China's Ministry of Emergency Management, this year rain-triggered floods and draught earlier, have threatened China's Three Gorges Dam, disrupted rice, wheat and other crops production in South China, and in the Yangtze River basin. Floods have affected 54.8 million people, causing economic loss of US$ 20.8 billion.Another serious problem that threatens China's food supply is insect infestations. The fall armyworm (FAW), which feasts on corn, has been detected in five Chinese provinces this year, pushing corn prices to five-year highs, despite the release of 1.4 billion bushels of corn from the country's reserves.China's real threat to food security comes more from food wastage than epidemic or floods. Per capita food waste in China is 93 grams per person per meal, with a waste rate of 11.7 percent. According to a survey data, Chinese consumers wasted roughly 17 to 18 million tons of food each year from 2013 to 2015, enough to feed 30 to 50 million individuals annually.Outside China, the pandemic had an impact on global grain production and trade. Vietnam and India have suspended rice exports and other countries have also done so subsequently. Further as per, China's Commerce Ministry in June 2020, Brazil, Canada, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Russia and other key producers of wheat, soybean and rice have cut their exports, including to China, to first replenish their own stocks. And this is indeed hurting China the most, as being the world's largest food importer.The coronavirus, locust swarms and severe floods across much of China's key farming areas are all putting pressure on supplies. At the same time, worsening security disputes with key import sources such as the U.S. and Australia have raised new questions about the nation's long-term food security.China's food prices climbed about 13.2per cent in July 2020 from a year earlier, while pork prices surged 86per cent, as per the National Bureau of Statistics. Surging prices prompted China to buy a record volume of meat, and China boosted wheat imports to a seven-year high in June 2020. During the first part of 2020, Chinese agencies resorted to release of more than 60 million tons of rice, about 50 million tons of corn, and over 760,000 tons of soybeans, (surpassing the volumes released during the whole of 2019), to arrest the rising food prices. And consequently the price of rice remained stable temporarily.The problem of food security has been the focus, when Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed (Aug 11) on putting an end to wasting food and called for promotion of thrift. Xi highlighted the need to maintain a sense of crisis on food security, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not the first time China has launched an anti-food waste campaign. In 2013, the 'operation empty plate' was launched and thus this campaign may be considered as 2.0 version. Following Xi's assertion, the Legislative Affairs Commission of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee set up (Aug 13) a special group to start legislative work to stop food wastage and various ministries followed suit. Xi's initiative sparked speculation by some media over whether China is in a food crisis.The evidence for China facing food crisis is reflected in the decline in the state's purchase of summer harvests of wheat - an important grain for Chinese households. According to data released by China's National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration (NFSRA), China's state grain reserve system purchased 41 million tonnes (45 million short tons) of fresh wheat from June 1 to July 31, a drop of 17.2 per cent from a year ago. Experts attribute this decline to the coronavirus pandemic forcing farmers to hold 20 to 30 per cent more grain in reserve.The food crisis could be gauged by China resorting to increasing grain imports of 74.51 million tons in the January-July period, (up 22.7 per cent from a year ago), as per data from the China General Administration of Customs. In June 2020, China resorted to massive imports of food grains. China imported 910,000 tons of wheat (197per cent increase year-on-year), 880,000 tons of corn (23per cent increase year-on-year), 680,000 tons of sorghum and 140,000 tons of sugar.While China and the US are reviewing the Phase-one trade deal, Beijing has been boosting purchases of soybeans, corn, cotton and pork from the U.S. to cool prices and as part of its commitments under the pact, but its purchases of American farm products in the first half of 2020 were still about 20per cent of the 2020 target.China is resorting to massive imports of food grains this year. On the surface indicates that the country is buying grains at cheap global prices for stock piling grains to deal with impending food crisis. This panic imports further suggest China feeling the heat on being isolated in the world, because of its aggressive foreign policy. China has opened many fronts of confrontation simultaneously in the world, which includes the US, Australia, Canada, India, Taiwan, many SCS countries etcChina, in order to meet growing domestic food consumption, resorted to buying agricultural land abroad. China targeted many countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa. Chinese companies in the agricultural sector invested in cereals, soybeans, orchards and livestock breeding in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Mozambique, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Cambodia and Laos. As per an estimate Chinese investments in agriculture abroad is $ 94 billion in this decade.Later China targeted Australia, the US and Europe. In Australia, the largest ranch in the world passed in Chinese hands in 2016, acquired by the real estate company Shanghai CRED. In New Zealand, Chinese companies bought dozens of milk and dairy farms. Ukraine, leased 3 million hectares of agricultural land to a Chinese company in 2013 and in France, China bought vines and acquired 1,700 hectares of cereal crops in central France.Xi's assertion on the campaign against 'food waste' comes at a time when China has made tall claims of its total annual grain output exceeding 1.3 trillion kilograms, with the per capita grain supply approaching 500 kilograms, in the past five years. Countering the media hype of China facing grave food crisis, Zheng Fengtian, Professor at Renmin University, asserted that China's food security was not seriously impacted by Covid-19 and its grain reserves are ample, with self-sufficiency rate of rice and wheat, being about 100 percent with current stock exceeding one year's annual output.While China is taking corrective measures to mitigate the food shortages through domestic and international sources, the large scale damage caused due to the floods, COVID, global backlash, economic meltdown, demographic/migration factors are likely to impact China's food security."

In January 2019, NPR reported on a Mongolian heavy metal band whose epic music videos were racking up millions of views on YouTube. Eight months later The Hu released their first album, which blends the screaming guitars of heavy metal and traditional Mongolian guttural singing. We caught up with two band members on a video call to Mongolia, where they have been waiting out the pandemic.  toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR  The Hu's first two videos, in which band members sing in a guttural way known as throat singing while throwing heads back and forth reminiscent of the headbanging of '80s heavy metal bands, picked up 7 million views soon after their release in late 2018. The all-male quartet's combination of leather jackets and skull rings alongside intricately carved Mongolian horsehead fiddles inspired enthusiastic comments from both Western and Eastern audiences. The videos now have over 93 million views combined.  Meanwhile, the band has taken things even further – to another universe. In February The Hu released the single ""Sugaan Essena"" for ""Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,"" a video game produced by Disney, Lucasfilm, EA and Respawn Entertainment. The song was created for use in the game and can be heard when players first meet the main character, Cal Kestis.  ""That we became part of this [Star Wars] universe is just unbelievable,"" says lead singer TS. Galbadrakh, who goes by ""Gala"" and spoke through an interpreter.  YouTube  The band also includes B. Enkhsaikhan (""Enkush""), G. Nyamjantsan (""Jaya""), and N. Temuulen (""Temka""). Band manager Tuga Namgur, who is Gala's older brother and the band's interpreter, says additional Star Wars collaborations are coming.  About This Series Goats are curious animals and ""Goats and Soda"" is a curious blog. Over the next week, we'll be looking back at some of our favorite stories to see ""whatever happened to ...""  While The Hu may not have envisioned performing for distant galaxies, they have always wanted to create music for listeners outside of Mongolia. They chose ""hu"" as a name because it is the root word for human being in Mongolian and that is who they wanted their audience to be – all human beings. Their goal is to incorporate as much of Mongolia's musical culture as they can into a rock style, the band's producer and songwriter B. Dashdondog, who goes by ""Dashka,"" explained in an earlier interview.  YouTube  The result is Mongolian folk rock, a genre that combines traditional Mongolian instruments, like a horsehead fiddle (morin khuur), Jew's harp (tumur khuur) and Mongolian guitar (tovshuur), with the pounding bass and drums of rock. The two-stringed horsehead fiddle is not only shaped to resemble a horse with the carving of a horse head and strings and bow made of horsehair, it also can be used to imitate the sound of a herd of horses.  Then there is throat singing, a technique associated with pastoral herders in Central Asia. The singer produces a low constant sort of drone at the same time as a series of higher tones.  The band named their first album, The Gereg, for a diplomatic passport used during the time of Genghis Khan. The legendary Mongol leader is also mentioned in a line about how he was fated to bring nations together in their first song ""Yuve Yuve Yu"" (What's going on?). It was the video for that song – with its dramatic scenes of Mongolian nature – and a second song, ""Wolf Totem"" – which starred a Mongolian motorcycle gang – that originally attracted viewers. While the imagery and instruments might seem foreign to those outside of Mongolia, the throbbing rock beat is not.  toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR  This unique cultural combination of Eastern and Western began appearing during Mongolia's transition from a satellite of the Soviet Union to a democracy late last century. In recent years it has proved popular with an international audience. Folk metal band Tengger Cavalry played at Carnegie Hall and the music of Altan Urag was featured in the 2007 film Mongol and in the Netflix show Marco Polo. The Hu are now topping billboard charts. In April 2019 ""Wolf Totem"" reached number one on Billboard's Hard Rock chart according to Billboard.com.  Nick Laviers, the audio director at Respawn who invited the band to perform for the Star Wars video, was among those who heard it.  ""The music had otherworldly-sounding vocals and unfamiliar ethnic instruments that could be alien, all on top of a classic-rock backbone,"" Laviers wrote in an email.  The combination was perfect for Star Wars. In ""Sugaan Essena"" the band sings in a unique ""Star Wars Hu language"" they invented. The Hu, wrote Laviers, ""put together a track that really hit the mark on everything we were looking for."" Since its debut in February the song's music video has collected more than 7.7 million YouTube views.  Gala believes the band's appeal comes from their message: ""The importance of being together and protecting nature and respecting each other is something we need in this world. That is why this message is received widely, because everybody wants it.""  Nevertheless, even Gala is sometimes surprised by how much the band is loved. On Facebook fans post pictures of tattoos they have gotten; at least one showcases Gala's face.  ""It's unbelievable,"" says Gala. ""When you see your own face on somebody.""  Like his bandmates, Gala, who is 30, trained on traditional Mongolian instruments at the Mongolian State Conservatory. Also like his bandmates he favors black t-shirts, tattoos and long hair. Yet The Hu's fanbase is not limited to a particular type of person, says Jaya, who in addition to throat singing plays the jaw (or Jew's) harp, tsuur (a Mongolian flute without a mouthpiece) and flute. Through an interpreter Jaya describes a scene at a sold-out concert at Le Trianon theater in Paris in February of this year when the audience began chanting with the band.  ""So many different types of people, who don't even understand the language,"" he says. ""But together at this moment enjoying the music and being together as a family of human beings.""  Performing on stage that night the band felt as if they had achieved something greater than themselves.  ""We always wanted to unite people, we felt like we were just doing it,"" says Jaya, who at 37 is the band's oldest member.  There has been some controversy. Early on there were negative comments about how a symbol on the band's instruments and rings resembled a swastika. In a Facebook message the band explained that the swastika shape has been a sacred symbol in their culture for thousands of years, but out of respect for their fans they would stop displaying it.  The pandemic has raised other complaints. Some in Mongolia say that the Mongolian government favors the band, flying them home from an international tour while Mongolians abroad remained stranded after Mongolia closed its borders. Jaya says they did not receive special treatment and waited 45 days in Australia before being flown back to Mongolia.  Further complaints came when the band's COVID-19 fundraiser for the government's emergency office was scheduled one day before parliamentary elections, a legal non-campaign day for all parties. Gala says the band had no political intention. They ended up changing the date, he says, and raising 55 million tugrik ($19,292) for first responders when the concert aired on national television.  YouTube  With their world tour cut short by the pandemic, The Hu have been focusing on a second album, which they plan to release next year. They have also been filming more episodes of their YouTube cooking show ""Hu's in the Kitchen."" Tuga the tour manager came up with the idea for the show while the band was playing in Detroit. Their 14th episode, which came out in late July, has more than 66,000 views. While earlier episodes feature a variety of foods, later episodes focus on Mongolian fare.  ""As an ambassador of Mongolian culture, we wanted to share every aspect of Mongolian culture and lifestyle, and not only play Mongolian music,"" says Gala.  In the most recent episode, they make huushuur, Mongolian fried meat pies – and joke around.  ""It's not easy to make dough for eight men,"" says Jaya, repeating a sentiment another member expressed in an earlier episode. (On tour the band includes four additional members.)  On the video as he fries the pies Jaya explains that huushuur is associated with summer in Mongolia along with Naadam, a summer festival that includes wrestling, archery and horse racing. Now that The Hu are back in Ulaanbaatar, they plan to cook more exotic Mongolian dishes. Jaya won't reveal what is on the menu next, but there are plenty of unusual meals to choose from, including marmot barbecue.

They also resolved to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability and resilient supply chain connectivity.  The report of the ASEAN India Business Council (AIBC) was placed.  It was also recommended that the ASEAN India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) be reviewed for mutual benefit.  Discussions on review of the ASEAN India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) took place.  Important value additions  ASEAN India-Business Council (AIBC) was set up in March 2003 as a forum to bring key private sector players from India and the ASEAN countries on a single platform for business networking and sharing of ideas.  The AITIGA is a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) among ASEAN countries and India which came into force in January, 2010.  ASEAN countries : Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Thus, Japan has mooted the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) as a trilateral approach to trade, with India and Australia as the key-partners.  Important value additions  Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI)    The initiative aims to reduce the dependency on a single nation (at present China).  SCRI is a direct response to individual companies and economies concerned about Chinese political behaviour and the supply chain disruption.  The initiative also potentially sees other Asian and Pacific Rim nations later.  Objective :  To attract foreign direct investment to turn the Indo-Pacific into an “economic powerhouse”.  To build a mutually complementary relationship among partner countries.  To work out a plan to build on the existential supply chain network.  Part of: GS Prelims and GS-III- Defence and Security  In news  The Special Frontier Force (SFF) unit, referred to as Vikas Battalion, was recently in the news.  It had been said to be instrumental in preventing Chinese occupation on the LAC in Ladakh.  Important value additions  Special Frontier Force (SFF)  SFF was established on 14th November 1962 in the immediate aftermath of the 1962 Sino-India war.  It falls under the purview of the Cabinet Secretariat.  It is headed by an Inspector General who is an Army officer of the rank of Major General.  They are highly trained special forces personnel who can undertake a variety of tasks.  Women soldiers, too, form a part of SFF units.  The SFF units are not part of the Army  However, they function under operational control of the Army  Do you know?  Major Operations of SFF:  Operation Eagle (1971 war with Pakistan)  Operation Bluestar (clearing Amritsar’s Golden Temple in 1984)  Operation Meghdoot (securing the Siachen glacier in 1984)  Operation Vijay (war with Pakistan at Kargil in 1999)  Part of: GS Prelims and GS-III- Biodiversity; Climate change  In news  The annual migration of butterflies from the hill ranges of the Eastern Ghats towards the Western Ghats has been observed earlier in 2020 (in the months of July and August).  Usually, these butterflies breed during the southwest monsoon season on the eastern areas of South India and their progeny migrate back to the Western Ghats in October- November.  Key takeaways  The Eastern Ghats complex of the Yercaud hills (Shevaroy hills), Pachamalai, Kolli hills, Kalvarayan are major originating places for the migrating species.  Possible Reasons for Early Migration : Change in rainfall pattern, a considerable increase in the number of sunny days and a population outburst of butterflies.  Do you know?  Four species of milkweed butterflies belonging to the Danainae subfamily are mainly involved in the migration — the Dark Blue Tiger, Blue Tiger, Common Crow and the Double-branded (commonly known as tigers and crows).  The Ferns Nature Conservation Society (FNCS) initiated a citizen science project in 2018 to study the migration ecology of milkweed butterflies in south India,  Important value additions  Butterflies  Butterflies are insects from the order Lepidoptera of phylum Arthropoda which also includes moths.  Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight.  Abundance of butterflies in any area represents the rich biodiversity.  Part of: GS Prelims and GS-I- Social issues & GS-II – Health  In news  Indian Vice President recently released ‘The State of Young Child in India’ report.  It is a comprehensive account of the challenges related to early child development in India.  Key takeaways  Prepared by : Mobile Creches. It is a policy advocacy organisation which works with the underprivileged children across India.  Out of 159 million children aged below 6 years in India, 21% are undernourished, 36% are underweight and 38% do not receive full immunization.  Huge returns on investment in Early Childhood Development (ECD) at the individual, household and country levels were also reported.  Top performers : Kerala, Goa, Tripura and Tamil Nadu.  States with scores below the national average – Assam, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.  Miscellaneous  Poshan Maah  Under Poshan Abhiyaan, the month of September is observed as Poshan Maah i.e. Nutrition month every year, since 2018.  ‘Agricultural Fund of India’ is being created to have complete information about the crops that are grown in each district and their related nutritional value.  It includes a month-long activities focussed on antenatal care, optimal breastfeeding, anaemia, girls education, right age of marriage, etc.  The activities focus on Social and Behavioural Change Communication (SBCC) and are based on Jan Andolan Guidelines.  A food and nutrition quiz as well as meme competition will be organized on the My Gov portal.  A unique kind of Nutrition Park has been created at Statue of Unity (Gujarat), where one can witness nutrition related education along with fun and frolic.  Shetrunji and Bhadar Dams of Gujarat  Due to heavy rains, Shetrunji and Bhadar dams have overflowed simultaneously.  These are two largest reservoirs in the Saurashtra region (Gujarat).  The two dams are across Shetrunji and Bhadar rivers.  These rivers flow in opposite directions.  These two dams have different catchment areas.  Sardar Sarovar Dam, also called Narmada Dam, is the largest reservoir in Gujarat  BIPOC  The term BIPOC became popular on the internet during the Black Lives Matter movement.  It stands for “Black, Indigenous and People of Color.”  The BIPOC movement urges to acknowledge the diversity in skin color, race, and hair.  It advocates for inclusivity and representation across all areas of life, from politics to skin care.  It is been seen as a substitute to degrading and offensive terms like negro, african-american and minority  (MAINS FOCUS)  INTERNATIONAL / ETHICS/ SCIENCE & TECH  Topic: General Studies 2,4: Effect of policies and politics of developed and developing countries on India’s interests  Ethical issues in international relations and funding  Context: Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the ‘approval’ of Russian COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V  Three Stages of Clinical Trials to test the safety & efficacy of drug  Phase I : with an average sample size of less than 100, it is the preliminary study of safety, where the objective is to find the acceptable dose level which will not cause serious side-effects.  Phase II is a study of safety and efficacy together, with a few hundred people or even fewer.  Phase III- It is a detailed evaluation of effectiveness in comparison to some existing treatment or some similar-looking treatment having no effect (called placebo). This involves hundred to thousands of people. This stage even allows scientists to look for rare side-effects that can’t be spotted in smaller, earlier stage trials  What happens after three phases of Clinical Trials?  After the three phases, if the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, the study report is forwarded to the regulatory agency, which, if convinced, permits its usage en masse.  Phase IV is the postmarketing surveillance stage. Such surveillance can only be conducted after the drug is marketed.  Concerns with Russian Vaccine  Standard Procedure not followed: The approval came before phase III of the required clinical trial was even started.  Inadequately vetted vaccine: Russia has claimed to have tested its vaccine on just 76 people in the first two phases.  Lack transparency: No research article is available in the public domain about the Russian vaccine. Researchers worldwide who are developing vaccines for COVID-19 publish their studies in peer-reviewed journals, which are constantly scrutinised by the relevant scientific community. The community, in effect, enhances the credibility of these studies.  Short Duration: Russian vaccine is dangerously rushed — it got approval in less than two months of starting the trial. Top scientists and even WHO have repeatedly maintained that a vaccine is not expected before 12-18 months. Durability of Vaccine unknown : Nobody knows the durability of the antibody created by the Russian vaccine — is it durable for a few years or a few weeks?    Impact on different segments of population untested:  A carefully conducted clinical trials might even show that a vaccine could be harmful for a section of the population. For example, a new type of measles vaccine in the early 1990s was found to be detrimental to baby girls, and so it was never licensed for the general population.  Lacks Support of Russian Doctors : In a survey of 3,040 Russian doctors and health specialists, conducted by the Doctor’s Handbook app, 52% said they were not ready to be vaccinated; only 24.5% said they were A leading respiratory doctor in Russia has quit the Health Ministry citing “gross violations” of medical ethics in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.    Consequences of Russian Vaccine  It is potentially dangerous for the people who receive it  It could also impede global efforts to develop quality COVID-19 immunisations.  Reduces the trust factor in vaccination programmes.  Leads to Vaccine Nationalism (dealt in separate Article)  People taking the Russian vaccine at this stage would effectively be part of a grand phase III clinical trial.

She is currently writing a book about textile artisans.  We’re on the eve of the U.S. Labor Day, traditionally the day beyond which one was never supposed to wear white, and we moved from enjoying summer’s bounty into the finish of the typical western food harvest season.  I was just talking to my mother, the avid home vegetable and flower gardener, and learned that my musings about food security are having some effect. She’s following her bumper summer harvest of tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli, spinach, and other assorted vegetables up, by planting for the first time an autumn vegetable garden – brussels sprouts, cabbage, spinach, and other assorted things. I’ll report back over the next couple of months on how this experiment works out.  This is as good a time as any to invite the commentariat to share their latest reports on their 2020 harvest so far. As well as to pass along any plans anyone may have for autumn planting (and for all you veteran gardener’s Mom is eager to take on board any advice or suggestions for her autumn North Carolina vegetable garden).  She also had some success with the blueberry bushes I sent her – not so much with fruit produced this year, although she did get enough berries to supplement some breakfasts. But the plants have settled in nicely, and she expects to reap a decent harvest next growing season.  I also pass along a plea that we all plant something from a Guardian opinion piece on farming, Enough with ‘local’ and ‘organic’. We’ll begin to eat well when we farm well:  As a first step, I would urge everyone to try to grow something of their own to eat, at least once. Of course, not everyone is lucky enough to own a field, or even a garden, but just growing something like a packet of lettuce on a windowsill can help to appreciate the beauty, the challenge and the sheer miracle of growing food. It helps us to start to think about the soil, about the life we’re nurturing, about the elemental processes that sustain us all. As you do so, you might start to think of the British countryside as your garden. You wouldn’t walk into it and expect to eat something from it that you couldn’t actually grow, or something out of season, or something that trashed your garden. Instead, you would look at what was available in each season and try to eat accordingly. Beyond this, if you can, get your food direct from a farmer with a sustainable farming system and environmental values (quite a lot of them can be found on social media and, yes, they often home deliver). Or try being a nuisance and ask more questions in shops and restaurants about where the food came from. If it doesn’t have an origin, a story you can understand, don’t buy it. And then be noisy. Demand changes to our laws that raise our standards and encourage progressive change on farms via environmental schemes. Above all, right now we should all raise our voices against the proposed US trade deal that would drive things to be much, much worse.  The focus of the Guardian article is sustainable agriculture, and not food security. But the remedy is the same. And yes, dear commentariat, I am aware that the herb garden I cultivate when I am parked anywhere for a long period is not going to keep me from starving. But it does help me meet my some of my alimentary needs and also puts me in touch with the agricultural cycle. For those who stay put longer, their ambition can exceed a basic herb garden.  Never have I so much not wanted my musings to come true as I am with my worries that COVID-19 will eventually threaten the food security of much of the world.  FAO Meetings and Warm Fuzzies  The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) 35th session of the Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific (APRC 35), finished successfully last week in Bhutan,as reported by Geo, FAO discusses food security, nutrition challenges amid virus crisis:  Representing Pakistan at the Ministerial Session of the Regional Conference, Federal Minister for National Food Security & Research, Syed Fakhar Imam said, “During these difficult times of COVID-19 and locust invasion, we are trying to sustain particularly those people living below the poverty line.”  Food security news at the moment is more optimistic than the general dire world situation, due to COVID-19, might suggest. The accounts I saw of the meetings were fulll of warm fuzzy reports, and let us hope that food security remains intact, for much of the world, despite widespread concern. This is one situation where I would prefer to be painted as an alarmist, and not have my concerns over food security come to pass, although there are worrying whisperings. From Geo:  On the third day of the FAO Regional Conference for Asia-Pacific, the FAO Director-General QU Dongyu, government ministers as well as civil society and private sector representatives voiced concern over COVID-19’s impacts on the food security and livelihoods of millions of people, and urged for greater action to overcome the food and agriculture challenges facing the region.  I must say the buzzwords reported made me very uneasy: although I admit there are no reports of starvation or even shortages. According to this report by Scoop World, Asia-Pacific Countries Pledged Bold And Innovative Action For Food Security And Livelihoods:  Innovation, solidarity, coherence and strong partnership among and within countries of Asia and the Pacific are required for the region to rebound from the damage caused by COVID-19 and the ongoing effects of chronic undernourishment. That was a call made by more than 40 member countries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations concluding a four-day regional conference. About 750 participants, including representatives of the private sector and civil society, pledged to work to transform food systems, making them more sustainable, productive and resilient, and to feed a hungry world in a way that is profitable for farmers yet produces healthy food that is accessible to all. “To transform food systems for sustainable healthy diets we must have coherence, partnerships and solidarity to reduce the costs of production,” FAO Director-General QU Dongyu said on the final day of the35th Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific, hosted by the Government of Bhutan. “Big data, a digital economy and mobile technology will help producers achieve that.” Today, mobile technology is leading innovation “and a smartphone in the hands of a smallholder farmer is his new farming tool,” the Director-General added.  Chinese Food Shortages?  More serious than the FAO meeting reports is the news currently coming out of China, as reported by Farmers Guardian, China may face food shortage,  Does this suggest Chinese food shortages may be imminent?  Or is is this just more China bashing?  If you’ve been paying attention to Links, you know that China has faced a swine flu virus, which has killed many of its pigs. Plus one is aware of its ongoing trade spats with the U.S., many of which concern U.S. food exports. China has also recently suffered widespread flooding. And of course, COVIV-19 seems to have originated there. Taking these things together, no one would be unduly surprised if food shortages were soon to be on the domestic agenda.  Over to the Farmers Guardian report:  The Chinese government has launched the ‘clean plate’ campaign, which was targeting wasteful diners and the livestreaming of extreme eaters. The message from the government has come at a time when the country faces not only the coronavirus pandemic, but tensions with the US, a major trading partner. General Secretary Xi Jinping called the phenomenon of food waste ‘shocking and distressing’ and signalled a clampdown on popular videos of binge eating on social media. The warning seems to have come with a sense of urgency, sparking speculation as to the motives behind it. Diners at restaurants were also urged to order less to waste less, with reports of restaurants placing electronic scales at the entrance for customers to weigh themselves before ordering. Speculation But the campaign has raised speculation China could be facing a food shortage, although state media outlets were quick to try and stop the panic of imminent food shortages, reporting that China had recently seen consecutive bumper grain harvests and record high grain output. As living standards have raised, so has consumption. Obesity levels have soared and China was estimated to waste enough food in a year to feed a country the size of South Korea. But with the pandemic already cutting consumption levels, China’s options to quell any shortages domestically were limited. Subsidising production could fall foul of World Trading Organisation rules which could heighten tensions with the US. This would mean China, already the world’s largest importer of food, would need to look to increase imports to meet demand. This could then have a ripple effect on prices all around the globe.  The Indian press has been quick to jump in and predict a possible crisis – and even the reputable Economic Times, a pink paper that would like to see itself as India’s FT has recently joined. This alarmism may be part of the current anti-China climate arising from the recent border disputes. And also because, unlike duding past crisis, COVID-19 has yet to see widespread starvation in India. I’d like to think that A.K. Sen is correct and that contemporary democratic India may manage to dodge famine – whereas colonial India under the Raj was not so lucky.  Can the same be said for concetmporary China? It’s perhaps too soon to tell – and China may be swept up in larger, world COVID-19 food security trends.  According to the Economic Times. With rising population and declining arable land, China may be staring at a major food crisis:  The mismatch between agricultural (grain) supply and demand in China, is high. China has struggled to feed its 1.4 billion people, amidst recurrent natural calamities (floods, draughts), shrinking arable land, severe water shortages, depleting workforce, etc. China estimates that by 2030, when its population is expected to reach 1.5 billion, it will need to produce an additional 100 million tons of food grains each year. As per China’s Ministry of Emergency Management, this year rain-triggered floods and draught earlier, have threatened China’s Three Gorges Dam, disrupted rice, wheat and other crops production in South China, and in the Yangtze River basin. Floods have affected 54.8 million people, causing economic loss of US$ 20.8 billion…. China’s real threat to food security comes more from food wastage than epidemic or floods. Per capita food waste in China is 93 grams per person per meal, with a waste rate of 11.7 percent. According to a survey data, Chinese consumers wasted roughly 17 to 18 million tons of food each year from 2013 to 2015, enough to feed 30 to 50 million individuals annually. Outside China, the pandemic had an impact on global grain production and trade. Vietnam and India have suspended rice exports and other countries have also done so subsequently. Further as per, China’s Commerce Ministry in June 2020, Brazil, Canada, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Russia and other key producers of wheat, soybean and rice have cut their exports, including to China, to first replenish their own stocks. And this is indeed hurting China the most, as being the world’s largest food importer. The coronavirus, locust swarms and severe floods across much of China’s key farming areas are all putting pressure on supplies. At the same time, worsening security disputes with key import sources such as the U.S. and Australia have raised new questions about the nation’s long-term food security.  Am I calling a food shortage in China? No, it’s too soon for that. Nor do I have any special knowledge of the Chinese situation, nor any first-hand observations. The last time I visited the mainland was 2008 (and Hong Kong in January).  But a Chinese food shortage is certainly something that one needs to keep an eye out for – alongside the looming food security issues that COVID-19 has spawned and that will no doubt persist until the pandemic crisis is over or at least under competent management by many countries in the world."

That is the World Bank’s “International Poverty Line (IPL).” If your income is at or below that figure, you are living in “extreme poverty.” In fact, it’s a political benchmark, low enough that the Bank can claim global poverty has been reduced significantly. Which also means that if you’re making two or three times that amount per day, you’re supposed to be overcoming poverty.  From a critical and human-interest perspective, the IPL is nonsense. Anyone living on $1.90 a day—the World Bank for many years used $1 a day to define extreme poverty—cannot possibly live a meaningful life no matter how defined. A figure even double or triple $1.90 cannot possibly address inadequate nutrition, schooling, and health care, for example. By setting the figure so low, the Bank, other international lending agencies, and governments can pretend that citizens making the Bank’s next levels of income, $3.20 and $5.50, are poor but still better off than their poorest cousins. In short, the figure evades responsibility to act on behalf of the billions of people living in extreme poverty, including those in rich nations.  Fortunately, we have an impeccable source for calling out the World Bank’s claim: Philip Alston, who recently left his post as the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. In his final report to the UN in early July, Alston said:  Even before COVID-19, we squandered a decade in the fight against poverty, with misplaced triumphalism blocking the very reforms that could have prevented the worst impacts of the pandemic. COVID-19 is projected to push hundreds of millions into unemployment and poverty, while increasing the number at risk of acute hunger by more than 250 million. But the international community’s abysmal record on tackling poverty, inequality and disregard for human life far precede this pandemic. Over the past decade, the UN, world leaders and pundits have promoted a self-congratulatory message of impending victory over poverty, but almost all of these accounts rely on the World Bank’s international poverty line, which is utterly unfit for the purpose of tracking such progress.1  The reality about global poverty, which the World Bank would prefer that we forget, is that extreme poverty has hardly improved at all in recent decades. “Even before the pandemic,” Alston says, “3.4 billion people, nearly half the world, lived on less than $5.50 a day. That number has barely declined since 1990.” Alston called the Bank’s $1.90 poverty line, which it uses to claim that over 1.1 million people were lifted out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2015, “scandalously unambitious.” “The best evidence shows it doesn’t even cover the cost of food or housing in many countries,” he said. “The poverty decline it purports to show is due largely to rising incomes in a single country, China. And it obscures poverty among women and those often excluded from official surveys in many countries, such as migrant workers and refugees.”  The COVID Connection    In the spring 2020, the World Bank estimated that 40 million to 60 million people will fall into extreme poverty (under $1.90/day) in 2020, compared to 2019. Again, the Bank used the same flawed measurement, which means we have to add in (by the Bank’s account) anywhere from 70 to 180 million more people in the $5.50 a day category.2 These dire conclusions are consistent with trade trends. Two analysts write in Foreign Affairs that it will probably take several years for the global economy as a whole to recover from the contraction brought on by the pandemic. They cite a massive decline in exports (2020 will be “the worst year for globalization since the early 1930s”), very high unemployment, and an especially harmful impact on low-income people, who lack the education, job security, and health to survive without government support that will not be available in struggling economies. In the less well off countries, there are no stimulus payments because they are going to be even more debt-ridden than ever.3 So far, it seems that only China has avoided this prediction on export decline.  Just as Alston charged, women will bear a particularly heavy burden because of COVID-19. An Oxfam report notes:  Although the virus appears to be killing men at a higher rate than women, cutting down on child and elderly care and public health systems traps women at home, a home that is not always safe: girls who are forced to stay home from school are at increased risk of sexual violence and early pregnancy women will suffer more in other ways. Some 70% of the world’s health workers – the most exposed to the virus – are women. Women workers are most likely to have precarious jobs without labour protections. In the poorest countries, 92% of women workers are employed informally. Women also provide 75% of unpaid care, a burden that is expanding exponentially in the face of stay-at-home orders. The problem will also be compounded if this pandemic were to be followed by austerity, as with the 2008 financial crisis. Reports are already showing that domestic violence has doubled in provinces in China where restrictions have been imposed– and this pattern is being repeated all over the world.4  Enter the Climate Crisis    The process of scientific discovery seems unable to keep pace with the crisis before us. As the world scientific community warned in November 2019: “we declare, with more than 11,000 scientist signatories from around the world, clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency.”:  Despite 40 years of global climate negotiations, with few exceptions, we have generally conducted business as usual and have largely failed to address [the climate crisis]. The climate crisis has arrived and is accelerating faster than most scientists expected. . . . It is more severe than anticipated, threatening natural ecosystems and the fate of humanity. . . . Especially worrisome are potential irreversible climate tipping points and nature’s reinforcing feedbacks (atmospheric, marine, and terrestrial) that could lead to a catastrophic “hothouse Earth,” well beyond the control of humans. . . . These climate chain reactions could cause significant disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies, potentially making large areas of Earth uninhabitable.5  As environmental security worsens, so does human security. The reason is simple: the intersection of worsening climate conditions and the pandemic. Flood, drought, and other calamities compound the vulnerability of populations already hit by the virus, especially the poor, the elderly, the unemployed, ethnic minorities, and health care workers.6 Governments are put under intense pressure in terms of emergency preparedness, public health facilities, long-term unemployment, and internal security.  Food security is likely to be especially hard hit by the combination of climate change and COVID-19. Arif Husain, chief economist for the World Food Program, writes that “the pandemic could drive 130 million more people [beyond the tens of millions already facing ‘acute hunger’] into that state by December. More than a quarter of a billion people are likely to be acutely hungry in 2020.”7 People working in the informal economy and export industries; people dependent on remittances from relatives working abroad; people in the fossil fuel sector—these are among the groups whose access to food will be deeply affected by COVID-19. And if they also happen to live in conflict zones, or areas hard hit by climate change, they face insecurity that goes well beyond food.8  The East Asia Picture    In general, the East Asia region’s economic development, measured by human development indicators, was improving somewhat before COVID-19. I chose nine countries at various levels of economic development to represent the region (see Table 1). Most of the nine improved their human development index (HDI) ranking between 2009 and 2019—for example, Thailand, from 87 to 77; China from 92 to 85; and Malaysia from 66 to 61.9 (Australia and Japan slipped, while Vietnam and Philippines hardly changed.) Poverty, reflected in the rich-poor gap, remained a serious problem, however, despite the overall fairly low Gini coefficient.10 The income share of the richest 10 percent of populations was much greater than the poorest 40 percent (Table 1, columns 2, 3 and 4), with the gap rising in four countries and falling in five.11  COVID-19 has severely impacted East Asia as it has every other region. The East Asia and Pacific region (fifteen countries and territories, including six added to those in Table 1) has had its share of infections and deaths, though as a proportion of world totals (as of mid-August 2020), the numbers are very low: about 2.6 percent of cases and 2 percent of deaths.12 But infection and death tolls do not display the links between a health crisis and poverty. For East Asia and the Pacific, the World Bank estimates that COVID-19 will have a devastating effect on regional economic growth and therefore on poverty rates. The last five years of gains will all be erased, it says. Specifically, the Bank reports that whereas before the pandemic 35 million people in East Asia and the Pacific would have escaped poverty (at $5.50), now some 25 million additional people will fall into poverty, plus another 11 million if economies continue to go downhill.13Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand are all predicted to experience major economic contractions before recovering in 2021.14  In East Asia specifically, average life expectancy and schooling were improving before the pandemic. As the last column in Table 1 shows, every country experienced growth in the HDI between 2010 and 2018, with China leading the way and the emerging middle-income countries such as Indonesia and Thailand also improving significantly. Even so, we are all aware that average figures may obscure as much as they reveal. Improvements in human development typically are not evenly distributed in any society because political elites allocate resources to favored groups and locales, which are expected to return the favor in loyalty to officials. When the next Human Development Report is published, we can expect that income gaps will widen and other human development indicators for all countries in the region (with the possible exception of China) will reflect the pandemic’s impact on everything from public health and childhood education to overseas remittances and small businesses. It is already clear that food and income poverty in particular have worsened. A World Vision survey in 2020 of nine Asian countries, for example, found that “currently the most serious effects [of the pandemic] are increased food insecurity and poverty for vulnerable children and their families impacted by the pandemic. As families are struggling to cope with loss of income and livelihoods, meeting basic household needs is a growing challenge.” The survey found that over 60 percent of households—an estimated 85 million—in those countries were in deep trouble finding food, work, and income.15  Winners and Losers    A major omission from the World Bank’s assessment is indicators of who benefits from poverty.  The fortunes of the richest 1 percent and 10 percent never fall, nor do the tax havens that enable multinational corporations to hide a large percentage of their profits disappear. Again, Philip Alston, in his final report: “Instead, multinational companies and investors draw guaranteed profits from public coffers [such as through tax havens], while poor communities are neglected and underserved. It’s time for a new approach to poverty eradication that tackles inequality, embraces redistribution, and takes tax justice seriously. Poverty is a political choice and it will be with us until its elimination is reconceived as a matter of social justice.”  Alston’s parting shots resonate with critical scholarship on globalization. For example, a recent study done for the Asian Development Bank affirmed Alston’s conclusions on rising poverty even before COVID-19. The three authors found that although income in Asia generally was rising, its potential benefits were being undermined by growing inequality in income distribution; that globalization was mainly benefiting people with skills, education, and regional resource advantages; and that inequality was adversely affecting economic growth, mainly by limiting productivity and consumption among low-income households, and by increasing the likelihood of social unrest.16 Clearly, these trends were, and are, the result of political decisions.  We in the United States understand the politics of poverty very well. Robert Reich, the former labor secretary who often writes on inequality in America, says: “Over the last four decades, the median wage has barely budged. But the incomes of the richest 0.1% have soared by more than 300% and the incomes of the top 0.001% (the 2,300 richest Americans), by more than 600%. The net worth of the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans almost equals that of the bottom 90% combined. This grotesque imbalance is undermining American democracy.”17  It does not take much imagination to come up with solutions to the current wave of poverty. Oxfam, for example, advocates direct cash grants to the poor, debt relief, subsidies to small businesses, and taxes on both private and corporate wealth. Similarly, the Asian Development Bank study urges government targeting of poor populations and poor districts within countries for educational, health, and work opportunities. But if “poverty is a political choice,” as Alston says, redistributing wealth and providing the ingredients of human security will require nothing short of a political revolution. Quick fixes and “reforms” cannot correct the “grotesque imbalance” that is truly global in scope.  *  Note to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

All these factors are creating an air of uncertainty among the diamond trade. We are looking at newer Far Eastern markets to boost our sales.""Besides, diamond traders are uncertain about the Chinese market ahead of the US presidential election as they feel US President Donald Trump might take some tough stance against China as part of his election agenda.India’s diamond trade witnessed a revival in Chinese demand in July and August. “Since China had lifted lockdown much earlier, the demand for diamond went up,” said Mavji Patel, managing director of Kiran Gems, a leading diamond exporter.However, Patel too said that if the tension between India and China escalates it will have an impact on diamond exports. He also said that since international exhibitions and shows are not taking place, it is becoming difficult to showcase products. “Sales are happening online. In gems and jewellery trade it is important that buyers see the products physically before placing orders,” he said.Meanwhile, gems and jewellery exports are projected to fall 25-30% year-on-year in this financial year as the first quarter was a “complete washout” due to the lockdown imposed to curb the outbreak of Covid-19, according to the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council.Exports of gems and jewellery from the country nosedived 41.85% in the first four months of this fiscal to Rs 25,797 crore. Exports of cut and polished diamond fell 41.66% while exports of studded gold jewellery plummeted 60.65% in April-July."

Nguyen Cong Hoan, deputy CEO of Hanoi Redtours, said that flights to these destinations will mostly serve businesspeople, workers and students and not tourists.  ""Although this shows that the Vietnamese government is opening up the doors to other countries, tourism will not see immediate benefits because the mandatory 14-day quarantine policy will discourage tourists,"" he said.  Hoan was commenting on a plan by Vietnam aviation authorities to resume commercial flights to Guangzhou (mainland China), Seoul (South Korea), Tokyo (Japan), Taipei (Taiwan), and Cambodia and Laos as early as later this month.  The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) said this plan, if approved, will bring in about 5,000 passengers a week to Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Can Tho City.  Phan Dinh Hue, CEO of Ho Chi Minh City-based tourism firm VietCircle, said people only travel when they feel safe, and amid the ongoing pandemic, not many are willing to take the risk contracting the virus on a flight.  People also do not want to be ""trapped"" in a destination if it is locked down, as happened to many last month when there was an outbreak in Da Nang City, he added.  What tourism companies want now is a chance to reboot domestic travel. Nguyen Quoc Ky, chairman of leading tourism company Vietravel, said authorities need to establish a map of safe travel destinations in the country to boost demand and help tourism companies survive.  Hoan of Hanoi Redtours proposed that authorities in each locality assess the Covid-19 situation in their area and make appropriate decisions.  If there was no Covid-19 cases recorded in a locality, tourism and entertainment activities should be allowed, he said.  He added that in the long run, if the resumption of international flights does not result in a surge of community transmissions of the novel coronavirus, the government could remove the 14-day quarantine policy. Only then would tourism companies be able resume their international operations.  The Covid-19 pandemic has seriously damaged Vietnam's tourism sector. Tourism revenues in the first eight months fell over 54 percent year-on-year to VND13.1 trillion ($569 million), according to the General Statistics Office.  Foreign arrivals fell 67 percent to 3.77 million in the period.  Last year, Vietnam welcomed 18 million foreign tourists, up 16.2 percent year-on-year."

The idea is to promote the areas of Pathumwan, Sam Yan and Banthat Thong as a living space where people of all ages can come to admire artworks, learn about the history and enjoy the rich cultural diversity of food together.  ""The James HW Thompson Foundation has operated the Jim Thompson House Museum, William Warren Library and Jim Thompson Art Center and our businesses have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic for the past several months. Our income has dramatically decreased after 90% of foreign tourists have disappeared. Now, we are shifting our target from tourists to local folks and foreign expats so that we can survive in this crucial time. But we can't do it alone, which means we need to have alliances. This is a good chance to build a strong network in our art community,"" said Ghitiya Gaweewong, artistic director of Jim Thompson Art Center.  ""Pathumwan isn't only a commercial district.

Conveniently located from the Pathumwan Intersection Skywalk, those without much time can arrange a half-day sightseeing tour starting from the BACC to enjoy a string of contemporary art exhibitions by local artists.  Now, its main attraction is the ""Glass Plate Negatives: Stories That Transcend Time"" exhibition with a showcase of 102 reprinted photographs of Thai kings, royal court members, palaces, historical sites and trading hubs that will be on show until Sept 20.  Jim Thompson House Museum. Photo courtesy of Jim Thompson House  All glass plate negatives were taken during the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV) to King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) and are now being displayed under four themes, allowing visitors to travel back to the mid-19 century to explore the land of Siam and observe how locals adopted Western innovations to develop the infrastructure structure network.  Back in 1960, King Chulalongkorn captured the limelight when a huge crowd of people sitting on numerous boats greeted him during a visit to Wat Lai in Lop Buri. Another glass plate negative illustrates a sunset over the river during his return to the provincial gendarmerie station in Pak Nam Pho.  Also on view are some images of the Chao Phraya River with a backdrop of Wat Arun and the intersection of Charoen Krung and Maha Chai roads that was once home to B.Grimm Pratu Samyot branch and the Thewarat Sapharom Throne Hall before it was converted into the Phaya Thai Palace Hotel.  A few minutes walk from the BACC to Kasemsan 1, the old warehouse has been transformed into the multi-functional Yelo House, home to hip cafes, design studios and shops selling a wide selection of vintage film cameras and other collectable items.  Until the end of the month, the ""Unformative"" exhibition takes over the art gallery's second floor to showcase a collection of striking paintings and wood sculptures created by local artists Gumsak Atipiboonsin, Duenchayphoochana Phooprasert, Sukanya Sornbun, Seni Chaemdet and Anurot Chanphosri. Their works talk about a relation between humans and nature.  Behind the Yelo House, visitors can cross Klong Saen Saep to explore the 200-year-old Baan Krua community, home to Cham migrants from Cambodia who brought silk weaving expertise. Back in the 1950s, Jim Thompson found this canalside Muslim hamlet and hired villagers to produce the finest colourful silks for his brand.  Yelo House. Photo courtesy of Sarakadee Lite  ""Baan Krua was once the biggest Muslim community in Bangkok. Now it seems like a living museum for young generations to learn about the history and the local way of life. We have been famous for high-quality silk and tempting Muslim cuisine,"" said Woothinan Nahim, a lecturer from the Baan Krua learning centre.  While the young generation has shifted their paths to become office workers, the 72-year-old uncle Niphon Manuthas is the only one running the silk factory to maintain unique traditions and local wisdom.  ""We've adopted silk weaving culture from China. Initially, we used silk in making pa khao ma and sarongs before Jim Thompson taught us how to dye silk in vivid shades. In 1957, silk production was booming and our community could earn up to 200,000 baht a month,"" Niphon said.  ""After Thompson's mysterious disappearance, we spent 10 years weaving silk to finish his orders before many skilful villagers moved to work with the Thai Silk factory by Jim Thompson. Today, our silk is available at five-star hotels like Shangri-La and Mandarin Oriental as well as the annual Otop fair, where we meet customers from the US, Australia and Japan. We also provide custom tailoring services, starting at 2,000 baht.""  Veteran artisan Siriporn Rawangnam is in charge of an old wooden loom and catches visitors' attention by using two-toned silks to create a unique turtle scale-like motif called Kred Tao. Recently, Niphon has gained notoriety by developing techniques to produce Sirindhorn silk that is light and transparent.  The tour comes to an end at Jim Thompson House Museum, located on Kasemsan 2. The home showcases over 200 antiques and artwork from Thompson's private collection which transports visitors back to the old days.  The highlights include Bencharong porcelain crafted by Chinese artisans to use in the royal court between the Ayutthaya and early Rattanakosin periods, an 800-year-old U-thong style Buddha head, venerable carved wood sculptures of Nat spirits from Myanmar and the 200-year-old Pha Phra Bot, the powdered colour painting on white cotton recounting the life of the Buddha and the Vessantara Jataka."

Today a startup that’s building microinsurance and healthcare services specifically targeting emerging markets is announcing a round of funding to meet a surge in demand for its services.  BIMA, a startup that provides life and health insurance policies, along with telemedicine to support the latter, all via a mobile-first platform targeting consumers in emerging markets whose primary entry point to online services is via phones, not computers, is today announcing that it has raised $30 million in funding, a growth round that the Stockholm/London-based startup plans to use to double down on its health services in the wake increased demand around COVID-19.  The company currently provides telemedicine as a service connected to its health insurance, and it has expanded to include health programs for managing illnesses and offering discounts for pharmacies, and the plan seems to be to bring more services into the mix.  This is the same approach we’re seeing from other insurance startups targeting emerging economies, including China’s Waterdrop, which recently raised $230 million. Looking at the network of services Waterdrop is building, including crowdfunding, gives you an idea of what else BIMA might potentially look to add in, too.  The round is being led by a new investor — China’s CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund (CEFIF) — with previous backers LeapFrog Investments and insurance giant Allianz (who were in BIMA’s previous, $97 million round) also participating.  The startup is not disclosing its valuation this time around, but in its previous round the company was valued at $300 million, and it has grown considerably since then.  BIMA has now clocked up 2 million tele-doctor consultations and has some 35 million insurance and health policies on its books, growing its customer base by some 11 million people in the last two years. It’s now active in 10 countries — Ghana, Tanzania and Senegal in Africa; and Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka across Asia.  At a time when we have seen a number of insure tech startups emerge in the US and Europe — with some, like Lemonade, growing into publicly-listed companies — BIMA is very notable in part because of who it targets.  It’s not higher economic brackets, or necessarily segments with disposable income, or those in developed markets with stable economies. Rather, its focus is, in its words, underserved families that typically live on less than $10 per day and are at high risk of illness or injury, with 75% of its customers accessing insurance services for the very first time, BIMA notes.  “Telemedicine and insurance are needed more than ever and COVID accelerated awareness and acceptance for these types of products amongst emerging consumers and government. They’ve gone from ‘nice to have’ to a necessity,” said Mathilda Strom, who co-founded the company with CEO Gustaf Agartson, in an interview. “Utilisation nearly doubled in our telemedicine services.” BIMA covers COVID and pandemics in general in its policies, she added. “We have paid out COVID-related claims to families of people who suffered or passed away from the illness.”  It’s also working with health authorities that have been overwhelmed in the pandemic. Pakistani government and Indonesian government now use BIMA to off-load their health services by providing teledoctor consultations or doctors chats to customers.  Aiming at developing economies where middle classes are still only materialising, currencies are potentially unstable, and there is still a lack of infrastructure means that BIMA is contending with a combination of factors that makes the bar high for entry, but it’s also potentially more rewarding because of the lack of competition and tapping a demand that is still rapidly growing.  “The onset of COVID-19 has brought home the value of telemedicine, to help prevent the spread of disease, and the importance of insurance, for peace of mind,” said Agartson in a statement.  “Through digital solutions, and a human touch, we’ve been able to serve hard to reach communities with tools and services that bring them a sense of security at such a challenging time. The funds we have raised will allow us to expand our operations and further invest in our product offering that will help us scale quickly to meet the unprecedented demand for our services.”  It’s interesting to see CreditEase, a Chinese investor, as part of this round: the idea of all-in, full service health services companies banked around the insurance proposition has been one cultivated in the Chinese market. But even with the development of HMOs in the US, it’s interesting that there have been relatively few startups around the world trying to develop similar models. BIMA stands out in part because of that.  “We are very impressed by BIMA’s innovative integration of micro insurance and tele-doctor services, which provide critical coverage to meet large unmet demand in emerging markets, and whose value is accentuated further by the current pandemic,” said Dennis Cong, managing partner at CEFIF, in a statement. “We are very happy to have the opportunity to join this meaningful journey, along with the established leading shareholders, and support the company to grow its business and expand its leadership position in its served markets.”  “The market that BIMA is serving is vast and demand for health services is tremendous,” added Stewart Langdon, a partner at LeapFrog Investments. “BIMA’s unique digital capabilities empower emerging market consumers to access many health and insurance services on a single, easy to use platform. That includes protection for millions of first-time buyers of insurance who would otherwise remain unprotected and at risk.”  “We are happy to continue our partnership with BIMA and jointly deliver telemedicine and remote healthcare services in developing markets,” said Nazim Cetin, CEO at Allianz X, in a statement. “We believe the demand for these services will continue to increase and want to manifest BIMA’s leading position in the market by providing support with our experience and network.”"

ASSAWIN PINITWONG  The Ministry of Public Health is still worried about Covid-19 infections in Myanmar following predictions that the virus could reach the Thai-Myanmar border in the next two weeks.  The director of the Division of Communicable Diseases, Sophon Iamsirithavorn, said the Covid-19 situation in Myanmar was a great concern as the country was now reporting more than 100 cases per day in many cities.  The disease had started to spread from Rakhine state on the west coast to the central region, he said, and although Myanmar's Covid-19 hotspots were still far from Thailand, it was forecast that the virus would spread to the border areas in two weeks' time.  Dr Sophon said stringent measures had already been put in place along the border.  Regarding South Korea's report of a 50-year-old infected man who had just returned from Thailand, he said officials in Bangkok had requested the person's details from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea so they could investigate the infection.  Col Akekapong Krittayakiatchuti, Commander of the 12th Ranger Forces Regiment Control Group, on Monday led a team of officers to at-risk patrol areas along the Thai-Cambodia borders in Aranyaprathet district, Sa Kaeo, including the famous Rong Kluea Market, in an effort to prevent Covid-19 entering Thailand.  Three Cambodian men were arrested while crawling under razor wire fences from Poipet in Cambodia and all were immediately screened for the virus.  They admitted trying to sneak into Thailand to sell goods at the market, saying they used to be stall vendors there but the pandemic had prevented them from reentering Thailand for more than four months.  The Department of Disease Control on Monday reported the results of Covid-19 investigations after a male inmate tested positive for the virus on Sept 3, saying that 520 of 990 people who had been in contact with him had tested negative for the virus.  Bangkok governor Aswin Kwanmuang said the Department of Health of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration had dispatched a team to the condominium where the infected man lived and found that 149 people there had been in close contact with him.  Six people in his family tested negative, however, and were now staying in a local quarantine facility. The other 143 also tested negative and had self-quarantined.  The inmate works as a DJ at two bars, on Rama III Road and Khao San Road. The authorities have shut both places until further notice.  The government on Monday reported one new case of the coronavirus over the past 24 hours, a returnee from India, as total cases rose to 3,445.  The Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration said the Thai worker, aged 27, arrived last Tuesday on the same flight as a previously confirmed case.  He has been quarantined in Bangkok and the infection confirmed in his first test on Saturday, even though he was asymptomatic.  So far, the infection rate among more than 3,000 people who have arrived from India stands at 10.1%. Of Thailand's 3,445 cases, 95.2% have recovered and 106 are in hospital."

""Now it's getting a little crowded again,"" he said. ""It's great to see new faces.""  For colleges and universities across the country, the challenges related to international students – helping them obtain visas, enter the country and, if necessary, leave it again – are among the most complicated in an already difficult task.  The federal government has not helped, issuing confusing and sometimes contradictory guidance on students' rights to travel and study in the United States during the pandemic.  An estimated 1.1 million international students attend college in the United States each year, according to the Institute for International Education, about 6% of all students in higher education.  The proportion is much larger at research institutions such as the University of Rochester, where about a third of undergraduate and graduate students come from China, India, South Korea and other places around the world.  Those countries, too, have their own regulations to be followed, further complicating the process for American schools trying to welcome students from abroad.  ""What applies to one student doesn’t apply to another,"" said Ravi Shankar, assistant vice provost and director of the International Services Office at UR.  Story continues  ""It’s so contextual and so dependent on an individual student’s circumstances.""  Trump administration order sows fear  Signs have been put up around the dorms at the University of Rochester reminding students to take steps to stop the spread of COVID-19.  The school year for countless international students nearly ended before it even began this summer after President Donald Trump's administration announced their visas would be revoked if their schools did not offer at least some in-person learning.  ""If they’re not going to be a student or they’re going to be 100% online, then they don’t have a basis to be here,"" said Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security.  Leading private universities, many of them increasingly dependent on international students for revenue, protested the decision as misguided and contrary to public health concerns.  Lea Thome, a junior political science major from Germany and president of the University of Rochester's Undergraduate Political Science and International Relations Council, created an online petition protesting the policy. Within days, it exceeded 440,000 signatures.  ""Many international students come to the United States for the opportunities, resources, financial aid and scholarships that are not accessible to them in their home countries,"" she wrote.  ""Returning home would force many international students to pause their studies because they might not have access to the resources they need such as the internet, electricity, or other.""  The policy was eventually rescinded in the face of a legal challenge, meaning current students could return to the U.S. to finish their classes. New students, such as incoming first-year undergraduates, still are unable to secure visas if their classes are fully online.  Shankar said the lack of clear federal guidance has led to a flurry of wasted energy.  ""Most of the battle we’re fighting is with the promulgation of these proclamations that have created a tremendous amount of pressure,"" he said. ""There is a slight sense now that we may be stabilizing. But you never know what’s going to happen.""  Quarantines, pit stops in other countries  Koko Chaumia, of Malawi, heads into the Susan B. Anthony Residence Halls during the annual move-in day for incoming students at the University of Rochester.  Amid all the institutional rushing about, students like Koko Chaumia, a senior from Malawi, were watching television.  Chaumia stayed in the U.S. after the spring semester but returned to Rochester from a state that necessitated a quarantine.  ""It was odd,"" she said of her two-week isolation. ""I finished all of Netflix.""  Many graduate students who live off campus or work at the University of Rochester Medical Center never left. But there were plenty who did manage to return to their home countries, not to mention incoming first-year students.  The University of Rochester strove to get most of its 4,000 or so international students back on campus early in order to complete 14 days of quarantine before other students arrived.  They were offered free housing on campus if they arrived early enough.  The greatest number of the college's international students are Chinese, and those coming from China had an especially taxing itinerary.  The U.S. has banned people coming directly from China, so many students spent two weeks in Cambodia or Vietnam before flying to the U.S and quarantining for another two weeks here, Shankar said.  ""I can’t even begin to imagine what that would look and feel like and the anxiety and stress levels that would cause,"" he said.  ""What if they got stuck in Cambodia or Vietnam and couldn’t leave? It’s a testimony to the enormous resilience expat students have in pursuing their goals to get here.""  Many students, particularly from China, have deferred their arrival until the spring.  Beyond the students, the university also must attend to the work visas of its hundreds of international staff and faculty, in particular at the medical center.  ""There's a whole smorgasbord we've had to deal with,"" Shankar said. ""There are no real quiet days for us over here.""

Today a startup that’s building microinsurance and healthcare services specifically targeting emerging markets is announcing a round of funding to meet a surge in demand for its services.  BIMA, a startup that provides life and health insurance policies, along with telemedicine to support the latter, all via a mobile-first platform targeting consumers in emerging markets whose primary entry point to online services is via phones, not computers, is today announcing that it has raised $30 million in funding, a growth round that the Stockholm/London-based startup plans to use to double down on its health services in the wake increased demand around COVID-19.  The company currently provides telemedicine as a service connected to its health insurance, and it has expanded to include health programs for managing illnesses and offering discounts for pharmacies, and the plan seems to be to bring more services into the mix.  This is the same approach we’re seeing from other insurance startups targeting emerging economies, including China’s Waterdrop, which recently raised $230 million. Looking at the network of services Waterdrop is building, including crowdfunding, gives you an idea of what else BIMA might potentially look to add in, too.  The round is being led by a new investor — China’s CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund (CEFIF) — with previous backers LeapFrog Investments and insurance giant Allianz (who were in BIMA’s previous, $97 million round) also participating.  The startup is not disclosing its valuation this time around, but in its previous round the company was valued at $300 million, and it has grown considerably since then.  BIMA has now clocked up 2 million tele-doctor consultations and has some 35 million insurance and health policies on its books, growing its customer base by some 11 million people in the last two years. It’s now active in 10 countries — Ghana, Tanzania and Senegal in Africa; and Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka across Asia.  At a time when we have seen a number of insure tech startups emerge in the US and Europe — with some, like Lemonade, growing into publicly-listed companies — BIMA is very notable in part because of who it targets.  It’s not higher economic brackets, or necessarily segments with disposable income, or those in developed markets with stable economies. Rather, its focus is, in its words, underserved families that typically live on less than $10 per day and are at high risk of illness or injury, with 75% of its customers accessing insurance services for the very first time, BIMA notes.  “Telemedicine and insurance are needed more than ever and COVID accelerated awareness and acceptance for these types of products amongst emerging consumers and government. They’ve gone from ‘nice to have’ to a necessity,” said Mathilda Strom, who co-founded the company with CEO Gustaf Agartson, in an interview. “Utilisation nearly doubled in our telemedicine services.” BIMA covers COVID and pandemics in general in its policies, she added. “We have paid out COVID-related claims to families of people who suffered or passed away from the illness.”  It’s also working with health authorities that have been overwhelmed in the pandemic. Pakistani government and Indonesian government now use BIMA to off-load their health services by providing teledoctor consultations or doctors chats to customers.  Aiming at developing economies where middle classes are still only materialising, currencies are potentially unstable, and there is still a lack of infrastructure means that BIMA is contending with a combination of factors that makes the bar high for entry, but it’s also potentially more rewarding because of the lack of competition and tapping a demand that is still rapidly growing.  “The onset of COVID-19 has brought home the value of telemedicine, to help prevent the spread of disease, and the importance of insurance, for peace of mind,” said Agartson in a statement.  “Through digital solutions, and a human touch, we’ve been able to serve hard to reach communities with tools and services that bring them a sense of security at such a challenging time. The funds we have raised will allow us to expand our operations and further invest in our product offering that will help us scale quickly to meet the unprecedented demand for our services.”  It’s interesting to see CreditEase, a Chinese investor, as part of this round: the idea of all-in, full service health services companies banked around the insurance proposition has been one cultivated in the Chinese market. But even with the development of HMOs in the US, it’s interesting that there have been relatively few startups around the world trying to develop similar models. BIMA stands out in part because of that.  “We are very impressed by BIMA’s innovative integration of micro insurance and tele-doctor services, which provide critical coverage to meet large unmet demand in emerging markets, and whose value is accentuated further by the current pandemic,” said Dennis Cong, managing partner at CEFIF, in a statement. “We are very happy to have the opportunity to join this meaningful journey, along with the established leading shareholders, and support the company to grow its business and expand its leadership position in its served markets.”  “The market that BIMA is serving is vast and demand for health services is tremendous,” added Stewart Langdon, a partner at LeapFrog Investments. “BIMA’s unique digital capabilities empower emerging market consumers to access many health and insurance services on a single, easy to use platform. That includes protection for millions of first-time buyers of insurance who would otherwise remain unprotected and at risk.”  “We are happy to continue our partnership with BIMA and jointly deliver telemedicine and remote healthcare services in developing markets,” said Nazim Cetin, CEO at Allianz X, in a statement. “We believe the demand for these services will continue to increase and want to manifest BIMA’s leading position in the market by providing support with our experience and network.”"

It evaluates all active citizenship by investment (CBI) programmes in the world and ranks them against nine pillars deemed most important to individuals seeking second citizenship by means of investment.  2020 CBI Index - A Guide to Global Citizenship - www.cbiindex.com  Of all existing 14 programmes worldwide, the report found that the Commonwealth of Dominica and the Federation of St Kitts and Nevis top the 2020 CBI Index ranking. Dominica succeeded at balancing straightforward processing and wider eligibility of dependants with reliable due diligence and an excellent overall reputation. Meanwhile, St Kitts and Nevis remains unchallenged as regards speedy processing times and longevity, with a focus on appealing more to families. Its new limited-time offer — whereby a family of up to four can obtain citizenship for US$150,000 via the fund option — addresses investors' need for more family-friendly solutions.  Similar to last year, fellow Caribbean nations — Grenada, St Lucia, and Antigua and Barbuda — join Dominica and St Kitts and Nevis in occupying the top five positions of the 2020 CBI Index. Vanuatu, Malta, Cyprus, Montenegro, Turkey, Bulgaria, Austria, Cambodia, and Jordan complete the ranking.  The 2020 CBI Index introduces two new pillars — Family and Certainty of Product — to the previous seven, and integrates settlement rights into the Freedom of Movement pillar. The family pillar considers how easy it is to include immediate and extended family members in a primary application. Certainty of product looks at the Programme's stability in five key areas: longevity, popularity and renown, stability, reputation and adaptability. These major adjustments reflect the shifts in the investor immigration industry towards more family inclusiveness and the need for trustworthy programmes. The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent closure of borders made many investors prioritise health, safety, a pleasant environment, and welcoming communities over global mobility.  Story continues  ""By blocking international travel, the Covid-19 pandemic has had the effect of reminding investors and the wider world of the fundamental importance of 'home',"" the researcher explains. ""Home and citizenship are closely intertwined, as only citizenship can give certainty that a person will be able to settle somewhere indefinitely. […] And, as the CBI Index highlights, there are few options for citizenship that are as expeditious and straightforward as citizenship by investment.""  ""The current global crisis has led investors to explore alternative citizenship and residence options with a focus on healthcare and standard of living,"" comments Micha-Rose Emmett, CEO of CS Global Partners — a leading industry firm and government advisory headquartered in London. The co-head of global wealth planning at UBS, Anna Brugnoli, echoes Ms Emmett's assessment. She adds that high-net-worth individuals seeking relocation evaluate how effectively a country responded to the health and economic crises — which the Caribbean excelled at. ""What we see is the question of 'do I have the right citizenship?',"" Ms Brugnoli told PWM.  Yuri Bender, PWM Editor-in-Chief, comments: ""Covid-19 has proved the catalyst for many trends which private banking teams witness in daily practice. One of these is the use of Citizenship by Investment (CBI) programmes to help global families manage both their structures and expectations.""  Click here to download the full report.  About the CBI Index  Released yearly by Professional Wealth Management, a publication from the Financial Times, the CBI Index is the only independent study that comprehensively evaluates and compares all active citizenship by investment programmes in the world. Created in 2017 by independent researcher James McKay, founder of McKay Research, the CBI Index aims to bring value to the investor immigration industry, and provide a practical, decision-making guide to individuals and families considering citizenship by investment.

Students across the nation were unhappy with the government’s decision to go ahead with entrance tests during the crisis and their anger only grew after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of holding the exams in under four minutes of the hearing. Repeated rescheduling and looming uncertainty made the situation even more stressful for students. The aspirant, hailing from a lower middle class family, found the lack of arrangements especially jarring as the family had to arrange for private transport which came at a huge cost. For him, as for thousands of aspirants around the country, the JEE journey has been one characterised by turmoil for reasons entirely out of their control.

Women from the area who previously worked as domestic helps for Mumbai’s affluent residents are now finding it incredibly difficult to land a job. This experience was echoed by other residents, albeit in different settings. Factory workers, for example, were not allowed to join their workplaces even as colleagues from other areas went back to work.

This has led to a rise in viral illnesses across the state. But since the symptoms of a normal flu overlap those seen in Covid-19, this is causing much confusion in the state. This becomes especially serious when people resort to self-medication assuming they're suffering from common cold and cough, which then leads to late reporting of Covid-19. If the virus is discovered too late, doctors can no longer manage the situation. Symptoms like gastrointestinal issues and a complete loss of sense of smell and taste can help distinguish Covid-19 from commonplace illnesses, say some experts.

This took an ugly turn for some Goans as they were also refused treatment by doctors at the Goa Medical College. This behaviour, the columnist argues, has been noted in past outbreaks as well. This stigmatisation is akin to the behaviour meted out to HIV-positive patients as well. Containing a viral outbreak, experts argue, is a task that can be undertaken effectively by governments. However, the burden falls squarely on the public and especially those who live in poor housing conditions and are thus more susceptible to infection. As a port town, Vasco is known for hosting a wide range of migrants and was the target of state intervention for contains HIV spread as well.

Further, they say, that uncertainties about the efficacy of vaccines still loom large over the medical fraternity. They say that combatting the pandemic will be possible when a complete understanding of the virus, including its epidemiological and clinical dimensions are arrived at. Till date the duration of immunity persistence against Covid-19 remains unknown. It has been assumed so far that vaccines are the way ahead in battling the virus. However, this assumption can be tested only a few months after the vaccine has been used on different populations. Further, they note the fact that the pandemic has hampered the progress towards Millennium Development Goals which aimed at halting the spread of other diseases such as HIV/AIDs and Tuberculosis. Read more here  On vaccines: Although many vaccines, including Russia’s Sputnik V, have yet to clear the phase 3 clinical trials, it seems like we will soon have multiple vaccines to choose from. It’s also important to understand what each vaccine’s objectives are and what our need is. Among different aims of a Covid vaccine are preventing the disease, cutting the transmission rate and also protecting a vulnerable section of the population. No vaccine should try to achieve all these objectives and the successful vaccines will be able to achieve only some of them. Which endpoint is desirable varies according to region and demography. An effective vaccine with a lower safety profile might be suited for a largely young population like that of India’s while this could be devastating for the ageing populations in the West. To understand the efficacy and need for a particular type of vaccine, it’s also extremely necessary that the trials are ethnically and racially representative of the local population. Read more here"

Dominica succeeded at balancing straightforward processing and wider eligibility of dependants with reliable due diligence and an excellent overall reputation. Meanwhile, St Kitts and Nevis remains unchallenged as regards speedy processing times and longevity, with a focus on appealing more to families. Its new limited-time offer — whereby a family of up to four can obtain citizenship for US$150,000 via the fund option — addresses investors' need for more family-friendly solutions.  Similar to last year, fellow Caribbean nations — Grenada, St Lucia, and Antigua and Barbuda — join Dominica and St Kitts and Nevis in occupying the top five positions of the 2020 CBI Index. Vanuatu, Malta, Cyprus, Montenegro, Turkey, Bulgaria, Austria, Cambodia, and Jordan complete the ranking.  The 2020 CBI Index introduces two new pillars — Family and Certainty of Product — to the previous seven, and integrates settlement rights into the Freedom of Movement pillar. The family pillar considers how easy it is to include immediate and extended family members in a primary application. Certainty of product looks at the Programme's stability in five key areas: longevity, popularity and renown, stability, reputation and adaptability. These major adjustments reflect the shifts in the investor immigration industry towards more family inclusiveness and the need for trustworthy programmes. The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent closure of borders made many investors prioritise health, safety, a pleasant environment, and welcoming communities over global mobility.  ""By blocking international travel, the Covid-19 pandemic has had the effect of reminding investors and the wider world of the fundamental importance of 'home',"" the researcher explains. ""Home and citizenship are closely intertwined, as only citizenship can give certainty that a person will be able to settle somewhere indefinitely. […] And, as the CBI Index highlights, there are few options for citizenship that are as expeditious and straightforward as citizenship by investment.""  ""The current global crisis has led investors to explore alternative citizenship and residence options with a focus on healthcare and standard of living,"" comments Micha-Rose Emmett, CEO of CS Global Partners — a leading industry firm and government advisory headquartered in London. The co-head of global wealth planning at UBS, Anna Brugnoli, echoes Ms Emmett's assessment. She adds that high-net-worth individuals seeking relocation evaluate how effectively a country responded to the health and economic crises — which the Caribbean excelled at. ""What we see is the question of 'do I have the right citizenship?',"" Ms Brugnoli told PWM.  Yuri Bender, PWM Editor-in-Chief, comments: ""Covid-19 has proved the catalyst for many trends which private banking teams witness in daily practice. One of these is the use of Citizenship by Investment (CBI) programmes to help global families manage both their structures and expectations.""  Click here to download the full report.

In 2019, the travel and tourism industry contributed 12.1% of the region's GDP and approximately one in 10 people are employed within and around it, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).  Nationwide lockdowns and international border closures imposed to contain the pandemic have been detrimental for the industry across the region. There are, however, some small green shoots of recovery with a focus on domestic tourism and local spending.  Popular tourist destinations like Thailand are poised to re-open and other destinations are also considering bilateral ""travel bubbles', 'green lanes"" and ""travel corridors"". Sojern, a tourism data analytics company, recently reported that online searches for Bali hotels have almost reached pre-pandemic levels based on potential re-opening early next year.  There is significant pent-up demand from the consumer, and government and industry need to work hand in hand to shape safe reopening plans.  The industry has benefitted from economy-wide stimulus packages, with many governments introducing tourism specific relief measures. Thailand issued a domestic tourism stimulus package worth US$718 million to reinvigorate domestic tourism, whereas Cambodia announced new safety guidelines and codes of conduct for tourism businesses.  Malaysia has seen a surge in domestic travel packages, while Vietnam has launched a tourism promotion campaign called ""Vietnamese People Travel in Vietnam"", and Singapore announced a US$$233 million voucher programme to increase domestic consumption across the sector.  While these initiatives are welcomed by the industry, they cannot go on forever and reopening in a planned and careful way is crucial to enabling this sector to be a growth engine for Southeast Asian economies, as it was pre-Covid-19.  The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) strongly believes that further coordination among Asean governments, as well as partnerships with industry will determine and map the pace of tourism recovery. Working hand in hand with industry will help accelerate the return and also drive new innovations that can be hallmarks across the industry moving forward, and establishing Asean as a role model to other parts of the world in terms of bi-lateral cooperation and industry-government engagement to plot the path forward.  The current situation is a public health crisis, but also a crisis of confidence at its very core. A key component of returning confidence to the travel and tourism economy is the requirement for coherent policies that enable the digital economy and foster innovation, underpinned by a commitment to security and safety.  Every traveller will be required to provide an increased level of personal data in order to travel. Now is an opportune time for Asean to focus on developing a consistent framework for personal data protection and cybersecurity. As technological advancements continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, so do the threats. It is now critical to protect individual data, and travellers will demand assurance that digital interactions with government and the industry remain secure.  Multiple touchpoints across the journey will also derive confidence that it is safe to travel. The first crucial interaction with the traveller will be online. According to Condor, 82% of global travel bookings in 2018 were completed via a website or mobile app. Companies such as Expedia Group and Booking.com have implemented online innovations that make it easier to cancel your trip if circumstances change, making it easier to plan and change your mind. In addition, short-term rentals in whole homes where groups can self-distance provides another level of reassurance. The booking process has been adapted to reflect these new innovations.  The decision making for the traveller will also in part be informed by initiatives across government and industry in raising health and safety standards. For example, the ""Amazing Thailand Safety and Health Administration: SHA"" project that was recently launched is a mark of quality certification of the service standards of tourism-related establishments. Airbnb has implemented enhanced procedures and guidance on cleaning procedures for rentals, and travellers will be able to identify and book accommodations that adhere to these standards. These partnership approaches are important for the traveller.  Once a journey begins, confidence will also come from increased health, safety and privacy across physical touchpoints. This involves two critical needs -- a contactless experience from the moment you leave your home to arriving at your destination, and the ability to securely protect traveller information such as identity, health and travel history.  Travellers will seek out destinations that have enabled and supported digital payments and commerce across all levels of the economy, with a focus on enabling contactless payment. The ability to be able to transact with a local merchant digitally reduces some of the hygiene concerns attached to physical currency. As more tourism related transactions go digital, it will be vital that SMEs accelerate the integration of digital capabilities into their business. There has never been a more important time to focus on bridging the digital divide.  People working in the travel and tourism industry have been hard hit. One of the biggest challenges for travel and tourism employees is what lies ahead and the likely requirement for new skills to be able to succeed. Reskilling and training to be better able to interact with the digital economy, expanded health and safety qualifications, and adapting to different customer service requirements will be part of the mix of skills required in the future.  During the pandemic, beyond its numerous customer and partner focused support and recovery efforts, Expedia Group launched a new ""Expedia Group Academy"" to upskill all travel and tourism workers across the sector. This free programme is designed to help displaced or furloughed travel workers expand their skill sets and professional networks. Booking.com focused its efforts on bringing accommodation partners the tools and tailored insights they need to respond to the evolving travel environment, capture new bookings and rebuild their business.  In the Philippines, the Department of Tourism launched an online training program for tourism stakeholders to stay relevant and learn to cope with the new normal. These efforts work both ways -- equipping employees to evolve and adapt, and helping instil confidence for travellers.  In an increasingly polarised world, travel brings people together. It breaks down barriers and builds cultural understanding and connectedness. More importantly, travel and tourism are inextricably linked to economic well-being. It is therefore important to work towards a rapid and efficient recovery of the sector.  With the right political will and fast moving partnerships, the industry will bounce back. The AIC and its member companies stand ready to help."

There are only nine weeks to go before Nov 3 when American voters decide on their new president. If former vice president Joseph Biden wins, Thailand must prepare a new strategy to ""renew"" and ""reinvent"" engagement with the US that will take be tougher on issues related to China, human rights and democracy. The Biden administration's approach could be a boon or bane for Thailand, one of its five allies in the Indo-Pacific, depending on the country's diplomatic pathway and strategic preparedness. With a new administration under the Democrats, the US State Department would again shape overall policy towards its benign ally.  Reading through the 91 pages of the 2020 Democratic Party Platform, one can easily figure out the Biden administration's plans for foreign relations and advancement of American interests overseas. On the overall policy towards the Asia-Pacific, seven out of 11 paragraphs on US foreign relations zeroed in on China. Among several pledges, this one stands out: ""Democrats will be clear, strong and consistent in pushing back where we have profound economic, security, and human rights concerns about the actions of China's government.""  Regarding other countries, Mr Biden will more or less maintain the legacies and practices of his predecessor and former president, Barack Obama. It must be mentioned here that Asean was given one distinctive reference on page 78. ""We will reinvigorate our commitment to robust engagement with regional multilateral institutions like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which will help us promote the rule of law and sustainable, inclusive economic growth on both sides of the Pacific."" The 32-word policy description gives a broad insight into what a Biden presidency would do to engage Asean.  In addition, if Mr Biden is to win the presidency, the US-Thai alliance would be given an extra boost which could have wider ramifications. On page 88, the platform states clear that: ""Rather than denigrate our partners and encourage tensions between our allies, the United States will work to strengthen ties with and between our key allies in the region, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia, and we will work to ensure that our alliances with Thailand and the Philippines live up to the values that our peoples share.""  All in all, it is not wrong to say that Mr Biden would follow President Donald Trump's templates without saying so on China. Indeed, Mr Biden cannot appear to be soft on China, especially at this critical juncture. The US status as the most powerful country in the world has been severely challenged by China. It also happens at a time when Mr Trump's global leadership continues to falter as he continues to damage US credibility with his personal style of diplomacy and unpredictability.  Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have come to terms with the rise of China, which they perceive as a threat to America's post-World War II dominance. Bipartisan support will be a powerful factor in keeping the Biden administration's China policy more assertive as he would be more consistent and respectful. American politicians could not bear to see China become the world's No.1 power. It is rare these days for the divided Congress to share common views but so far China's rise has united them. Therefore, China currently is no longer a partner but a rival for the US, a huge turnaround from the past.  Mr Biden will lead the US to compete with China in a more concerted way by calling on friends and allies to form a coalition of the willing on issues that Beijing displays weakness or is perceived as lacking creditability on. If this trend happens, the countries that have close ties with China, especially among the 10 members of Asean, would be affected. The repercussions could be great or small depending on the perceived damage caused to their ties with China by US strategies or on specific issues.  Under a Biden presidency, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia will be high on the American agenda as the key countries in continental Southeast Asia that have close relations with China. They are also the riparian countries of the mighty Mekong River. Washington will continue to reinvent its policies toward the resource-rich subregion with special emphasis on US-Vietnam strategic relations.  The current US administration has failed to make substantive progress in this region due to Mr Trump's transactional approach based on improving trade deficits and other news-generating headlines. More broadly, Mr Trump has focused too much on the Korean Peninsula and the Middle East, which has further dampened his and America's reputation as the outcomes were different from his expectations.  Within the region, Mr Trump has left Mr Obama's Asean policy untouched. He could get away with the US-Asean ties but being Mr Trump, he has forgotten to appoint an Asean ambassador to the Jakarta-based Asean Secretariat, a big insult to the grouping for the country which often states that Asean matters to the US. Currently, 93 countries have ambassadors accredited to the Asean Secretariat. For nearly four years, the US has gone without an Asean ambassador.  Issues related to China are multifaceted and could easily upset the ties Thailand has with the two superpowers. For instance, the Democrat platform explains broadly how the Biden administration would protect human rights around the world. If Washington decides to pressure Bangkok to act on key rights issues in the region, it could spell trouble. The crisis in Xinjiang involving the Uighurs could be a case study. In August 2015, due to the country's policy towards the repatriation of Uighur refugees, Thailand suffered one of its biggest terrorist attacks which resulted in the deaths of 20 people at the Erawan Shrine in downtown Bangkok. If this sensitive issue is on the Thai-US agenda, it will certainly impact bilateral relations in unexpected ways.  For Thailand's future, it is imperative that the US and China have a stable relationship. From the Thai perspective, their relations would not be able to return to past affinity, especially those during the 1980s. The most important issue for Thailand is how to manage the two most powerful countries in the world to avoid any miscalculated risks. Healthy competition between China and the US will allow Thailand to balance its ""win-win"" approach more efficiently.  Truth be told, with the Trump administration, Thailand has been able to cope with dual pressure from Washington and Beijing. Bangkok has collaborated with Washington as part of an international campaign to isolate Pyongyang. Thai-North Korean trade was cut off in early 2018 following strong pressure from the US. But Bangkok also supports continued dialogue with Pyongyang which Beijing advocated. Unlike the US, Thailand cannot adopt adventuristic diplomacy at will as Mr Trump has tended to do.  Recently, Washington has also pressed Bangkok for more visible positions on the South China Sea conflict. For decades after the maritime disputes were thrust onto the Asean agenda, Thailand managed its policies and approaches in a very well-balanced way, without alienating concerned claimants or jeopardising the Asean position. In responding to the US pressure, the Thai government has recently formulated five positions on the South China Sea quagmire: supporting freedom of navigation and overflights; adopting a balanced approach with major powers; promoting stability and strategic trust via the Asean-China framework; promoting cooperation benefitting all sides; supporting an effective COC that encompasses mutual interest and sustainable development for all.  Most importantly, given the intensified conflicts between claimants in the past few months, Thailand has repeatedly called for ""self-restraint"" -- meaning halting all assertive military activities -- among concerned parties. Thailand has proposed a series of best practices and non-binding guidelines to promote mutual trust and ensure stability in the disputed sea at the height of maritime tension.  Under Mr Biden, US diplomacy would also be based on values on top of its national interest. If Mr Biden overplays these American values it could backfire on overall US diplomatic objectives, especially in the post-Covid-19 world. It is incumbent on Mr Biden's team of foreign advisers to moderate the US approach to balance both values and national interests when dealing with the region.  Southeast Asian countries, individually or under the Asean flag, cannot afford to become anti-Chinese as the United States has often been inclined to be. What the future US administration could do is to help the region to become more resilient and prosperous, so that these countries can engage their giant neighbour in the most efficient and beneficial way."

In May WHO Health Emergencies Programme executive director Dr Michael Ryan praised New Zealand for its ""very systematic"" response to Covid-19.  Adhanom Ghebreyesus went on to urge countries to invest in public health.  Covid-19 vaccine could be available in Australia early next year  ""Public health is the foundation of social, economic and political stability. That means investing in population-based services for preventing, detecting and responding to disease.  ""This will not be the last pandemic. History teaches us that outbreaks and pandemics are a fact of life. But when the next pandemic comes, the world must be ready – more ready than it was this time.    ""In recent years, many countries have made enormous advances in medicine, but too many have neglected their basic public health systems, which are the foundation for responding to infectious disease outbreaks.    Joe Biden's Covid-19 plans would 'destroy this country', Trump says  ""Part of every country’s commitment to build back better must therefore be to invest in public health, as an investment in a healthier and safer future.""  His warning today comes as India passed Brazil as the country with the second most Covid-19 cases.  Meanwhile, the head of emergencies at the World Health Organization said that governments that provide ""politically motivated"" information to their communities about the coronavirus pandemic could face a political backlash.  Dr Michael Ryan also called for transparency and ""admission of error"" when warranted by decision-makers.  Speaking in general terms after being asked about conflicting messages sent by Brazilian government over the response to Covid-19, he suggested people won't be fooled.  ""People aren't looking for magical answers, and they're not looking for unicorns,"" he told reporters in Geneva. ""They understand we all live in the real world, and in trying to present oversimplified, simplistic solutions for people is not a long-term strategy that wins with populations.""  Ryan said messages about the Covid-19 situation sometimes come with ""political overtones"" and alluded to a saying that trust takes years to build but seconds to lose.  ""If communities perceive that they're getting information that is being politically manipulated or that it has been managed in a way that is that is distorting evidence, then unfortunately that comes back to roost,"" he said.  Meanwhile at the press briefing, Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for Covid-19, said studies were ongoing to understand how long an immunity response lasted for in infected patients.  Kerkhove said there were examples of re-infections suggesting immunity could decline in some individual, but more research was needed."

It was witnessed by Zhu Jianguo, general manager of MCC Central Research Institute of Building and Construction and chairman of MCC Singapore in Beijing, as well as Johor Menteri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad in Johor.  During the virtual signing ceremony, IWH director Datuk Mohd Noorazam Osman and MCC Singapore Tan Zhiyong inked the agreements in Johor and Singapore respectively while viewing a live cast from the other countries through a private Zoom link. Also present were IWH executive vice-chairman Tan Sri Lim Kang Hoo and group executive director Lim Chen Herng.  Since 2010, MCC Singapore has developed and project managed 15 residential projects in Singapore. Currently, it is also developing JKT Living Star, a 3,648-unit condominium with an adjoining commercial zone in Jakarta; and Sky Villa, a 256-unit high-end condominium in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  The joint venture marks the company’s first major foray into the real estate industry of Malaysia.  Tan said they envision the project to become the new uptown area of Johor -- a smart city with intelligent features and cutting-edge home concepts.  “We hope this project can catalyse Johor’s urban transformation into an even more thriving and technologically advanced city in the next decade.  “We are certainly upbeat about this mega development project as the land site fronting Skudai is one of the most sought after development locations in Johor mainly due to its proximity to a captive population of affluent households and high density of businesses, ” Tan said.  Lim Chen Herng said the project would be a landmark development with far-reaching social and economic benefits for the people and state of Johor.  “It will likely inject a new momentum and excitement into Johor’s property landscape, ” he said."

From the article: Deliberations about mandated inspections and how many Dreamliners might be covered have been under way inside the FAA for months, according to people familiar with the matter. Such a directive would target excessive stresses that could cause premature material fatigue affecting the carbon composite parts that fit behind the passenger cabin. A person familiar with Boeing’s internal review said Sunday that there is no indication at this point suggesting the defects stretch back to the jet’s early years but said the analysis was continuing. The FAA, according to one person briefed on the agency’s deliberations, is focused on identifying how the manufacturing breakdowns occurred, why Boeing’s computerized safeguards failed to flag mismatches between the parts that failed to meet design standards and what changes are required to ensure the 787 fleet’s continued safety. As Boeing engineers comb through records to identity planes with possible flaws, the FAA already has learned what prompted one of the defects: the plane maker didn’t test how it produces shims, or material that fills gaps between barrel-shaped sections of the jets’ fuselages, to ensure they meet requirements , according to the FAA memo. The shims are produced at Boeing’s Dreamliner factory in North Charleston, S.C. Oh.

Lauding the announcement by Chancellor Angela Merkel over the weekend on her Government’s investment of €4 billion by 2026 to strengthen Germany’s public health system, Tedros said, “I call on all countries to invest in public health, and especially in primary health care, and follow Germany’s example.” Although Germany’s response was strong, it was also learning lessons, he pointed out.  “This will not be the last pandemic. History teaches us that outbreaks and pandemics are a fact of life,” he said, urging the world to be better prepared when the next pandemic comes around.  Many countries have made enormous advances in medicine, but too many have neglected their basic public health systems, which are the foundation for responding to infectious disease outbreaks, he said. In fact, part of every country’s commitment to build back better must involve greater investment in public health, he added.  Outlining some good examples, he said, Thailand was reaping the benefits of 40 years of health system strengthening. “A robust and well-resourced medical and public health system, allied with strong leadership informed by the best available scientific advice, a trained and committed community workforce with one million village health volunteers, and consistent and accurate communication, have built trust and increased public confidence and compliance.”  Italy’s hard decisions  Italy was among the earliest countries to experience a large outbreak outside China, and a pioneer or sorts. “Italy took hard decisions based on the evidence and persisted with them, which reduced transmission and saved many lives. National unity and solidarity, combined with the dedication and sacrifice of health workers, and the engagement of the Italian people, brought the outbreak under control,” he said.  “Mongolia acted very early, activating its State Emergency Committee in January. As a result, despite neighbouring China, Mongolia’s first case was not reported until March and it still has no reported deaths.”  Mauritius was at high-risk, given its high population density, with high rates of non-communicable diseases and many international travellers. But quick, comprehensive action, initiated in January, and previous experience with contact tracing paid off, he said.  Although the Americas has been the most-affected region, Uruguay has reported the lowest number of cases and deaths in Latin America, both in total and on a per capita basis, said Tedros.  Pointing out, “This is not an accident,” he said, “Uruguay has one of the most robust and resilient health systems in Latin America, with sustainable investment based on political consensus on the importance of investing in public health.”  Pakistan deployed the infrastructure built up over many years for polio to combat Covid-19, he said. “Community health workers who have been trained to go door-to-door vaccinating children for polio have been utilized for surveillance, contact tracing and care.”  The examples are aplenty, including Cambodia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Senegal, Spain, Vietnam and more, said Tedros pointing out that many of them had done well “because they learned lessons from previous outbreaks of SARS, MERS, measles, polio, Ebola, flu and other diseases.”  Upcoming review  Meanwhile, the Review Committee of the International Health Regulations will start its work on Tuesday, he said, adding that the IHR was the most important legal instrument in global health security.  The review committee will evaluate the functioning of the IHR during the pandemic so far, and recommend any changes it believes are necessary, he said. Depending on progress made, the committee may present an interim progress report to the resumed World Health Assembly in November, and a final report to the Assembly in May next year, he added."

While cases remain under control in Cambodia, Denmark, Mauritius, and Morocco, they are on the rise in Ethiopia and parts of the United States. Infections have risen so sharply in France, Kenya, and Spain that new lockdowns may be imminent. In Brazil and South Africa, the peak may be yet to come.  Few countries are prepared for the menacing autumn that lies ahead. This is particularly true in Africa, where the public-health and economic response has not come anywhere near matching the scale of the COVID-19 crisis.  So far, Africa has reported more than 1.2 million COVID-19 infections and over 30,000 deaths. Yet only 12 of Africa’s 54 countries have tested more than 10 percent of their population. And while community transmission increases, contact-tracing efforts remain tentative. Yet lockdowns cost the continent over $65 billion per month. The International Monetary Fund now expects economic activity in sub-Saharan Africa to contract by 3.2 percent this year.  While the COVID-19 crisis has spared no country, only some have been able to implement large-scale support schemes. The U.S. quickly passed a $2 trillion stimulus package, including direct payments to households, enhanced unemployment benefits, and financial support for ailing businesses. The United Kingdom’s $400 billion support package has helped to keep businesses afloat and unemployment in check, such as by paying a large share of furloughed employees’ wages.  France has also spent heavily to prop up its economy, including by bailing out its flagship airline and automobile industry. And this is to say nothing of the 750 billion euro ($889 billion) recovery fund it recently agreed with its European Union partners. Japan’s economic stimulus package amounted to nearly $1 trillion.  What all of these efforts have in common is a national or regional focus, which has been the prevailing approach to COVID-19. A welcome exception is the G-20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative. If fully implemented, the DSSI is supposed to provide more than $12 billion in additional liquidity to the 76 least-developed countries in 2020, and an additional $14 billion in 2021.

Creditor and debtor countries have not fully participated in the initiative, owing to factors like target countries’ lack of understanding of the process or their fear of a ratings downgrade.  All of these hurdles can and must be overcome. The Paris Club and the G-20 secretariat are already working to address uncertainty. Ratings agencies must also be convinced to remove the specter of downgrades for DSSI countries, and debtor and creditor countries should be encouraged to participate.  But even if the DSSI is fully implemented, it will not be enough to close Africa’s pandemic-response funding gap, which is likely to amount to some $100 billion annually over the next three years. To help cover the shortfall, multilateral lenders should step up.  So far, the African Development Bank, the IMF, and the World Bank have disbursed about $60 billion to Africa. But, in order to front-load support for developing economies over the next two years, they will need to expand their capital base significantly. That is why we are calling for a new replenishment round for the World Bank’s International Development Association, and additional resources for other multilateral development banks and the IMF.  Moreover, the IMF should consider a new allocation of its reserve asset, Special Drawing Rights. The IMF issued SDRs in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and the current crisis is even deeper and broader.  But a new allocation will take time. In the interim, the G-20 countries should make available the $129.7 billion in unused SDRs they already hold, in the form of loans to developing and emerging economies. The IMF should be responsible for devising how to allocate these existing SDRs to vulnerable countries.  The G-20 itself can also do more. Capital markets remain an important source of funds for fiscally strained governments. Until recently, access to these markets enabled emerging and developing countries with robust macroeconomic fundamentals to boost investment in growth-enhancing sectors. But the COVID-19 crisis has made this much harder.  To support these countries, the G-20 should support the establishment of a liquidity and sustainability facility, which can lower borrowing costs and help governments secure bridge financing and manage their liabilities. In fact, similar facilities in key OECD countries have helped to limit the pandemic’s financial and economic impact, including by preventing major liquidity crises.  As for countries whose fundamentals were weak even before the crisis, they will need to pursue debt restructuring. Argentina is already on that path, and more are sure to follow. An updated framework will be needed to help them work through the process.  The simple fact is that some countries are far better equipped to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic than others, and in a deeply interconnected global economy, no one can escape this crisis alone. The international community—especially the G-7 and the G-20—must take bold, innovative, and expeditious action to support those in need. The solutions are known. But implementing them will demand global leadership."

That’s because his company built a kindergarten next to the factory, part of a new trend of rethinking child care in Vietnam. As three-generation homes become less common, parents are less likely to have grandparents around to watch children while they work.  Companies that pay for these and other child care solutions say they do it for a counterintuitive reason -- it saves them money.  Eric Lee, a human resource manager at Taekwang Vina, a footwear company, estimates his company lost $1 million a year because of unplanned absences by employees.  “Opening a kindergarten has helped our factories cut unplanned absenteeism by 20 percent,” said Lee. “The benefits certainly outweigh the challenges, and we believe child care is an important part of the company’s growth strategy,” he added.  Such savings help to convince companies they should ensure that staff have a way to get child care, according to the International Finance Corporation. In addition to the ethics of access to child care, it helps to attract good employees, increase productivity, and increase staff satisfaction, the IFC said in an August report.  Companies that can’t afford to build kindergartens are offering other incentives. They include monthly subsidies to help staff pay for care, paternity and maternity leave, work from home or other flexible work, or a mix of options.  Vietnamese employees are increasingly asking for those options as society changes. It used to be that working parents often lived with their own parents, who would take care of the grandchildren so that both mother and father could go to work. However, more parents are choosing to move out now. Others are migrant workers who live far from grandparents in their hometowns.  Can, the security worker, did not have the option of grandparent sitters. So he finds it helpful to go to work knowing someone is looking after his child not far away.  “I feel that the teachers really care about my child,” he said of the factory’s kindergarten. “Communication with parents is good, and the management is transparent.”  Such “family-friendly workplaces” can give employers a hiring edge, said Kyle Kelhofer, IFC country manager for Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Foreign investment is increasing in Vietnam, leading to more competition among companies to recruit workers. When companies provide support, such as child care, they are more likely to attract and retain workers, according to the IFC report.  Among other benefits, Lee said access to child care decreased the rate of turnover in the workforce at his company. Taekwang Vina said the efforts also improved its relationship with local authorities and its corporate reputation.  “When schools and daycares closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear how closely linked productivity is to child care. We cannot forget that as we head into recovery from the COVID-19 crisis,” Kelhofer said. “There is an opportunity for businesses in Vietnam to gain a competitive edge and differentiate themselves by introducing child care support for employees.”"

Photo and… [+7015 chars]","This article by Darika Bamrungchok is from EngageMedia, a non-profit media, technology and culture organization. This story was edited and republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.  After years of repression, censorship, and injustice under a pro-military government, thousands of protesters in Thailand are taking to the streets and to the internet to call for political changes and democratic reforms. What started as pro-democracy rallies by students in February 2020 have now evolved to countless protests led by Thai youth and students as young as 14-years-old against the pro-military government taking place almost daily in at least 55 out of 77 provinces nationwide.  Three demands  This student-led pro-democracy movement is the first time in modern Thai history that the Thai monarchy had been talked about publicly in a critical way since doing so is a jailable offense. The protests, led by the Free People Movement, are demanding changes in a country with a long history of suppressing dissent. Under the overarching goal to have “a democratic form of government with the monarch under the constitution”, the movement is demanding three key changes to the current Thai government: dissolve the Parliament, re-write the military-backed constitution, and stop intimidating and arbitrarily arresting critics.  But much like recent attacks on freedom of expression online in neighbouring Philippines and Hong Kong, Thai protesters and media are increasingly being silenced by their government in both physical and digital spaces.  Just this August 26, Free People Movement leaders Tattep “Ford” Ruangprapaikitseree and Panumas “James” Singprom were arrested for their role in the July 18 anti-government rally. They have since been granted bail. A day earlier, after pressure from the Thai government, Facebook had blocked access within Thailand to the “Royalist Marketplace”, a group with over a million members where Thai citizens could discuss the monarchy. Almost immediately, however, Facebook said it was prepared to legally challenge the Thai government’s request. As of writing, a new group with the exact same name has already emerged, with over 500,000 members joining within the first day of its creation.  On top of these crackdowns, the local Thai media also cannot freely report on the state’s harassment and intimidation against protesters out of fear of being targeted by the government’s legal measures and financial backlash.  The first wave of protests  In late February 2020, the first wave of student protests across Thailand was initially triggered by the Constitutional Court’s dissolution of the pro-democracy Future Forward Party, an opposition party popular among younger voters. Soon after, the Thai government signed an emergency decree prohibiting anti-government rallies in the name of curbing the spread of COVID-19. But by June, Thais had grown even angrier at the government due to the increasing economic hardship brought on by the pandemic, the disappearance of Thai anti-government activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit in Cambodia, and the perceived failings of the justice system in the case of Vorayuth Yoovidhya [a billionaire heir accused of killing a police officer during a car crash in 2012. The case against him was dropped triggering public outcry against impunity for the rich].  The second wave of protests  This combination of grievances, along with the easing of lockdowns in the country, sparked the second wave of protests. On July 18, the Free Youth group and the Student Union of Thailand organized a peaceful rally in front of Bangkok’s Democracy Monument with over 2,000 protesters. This time, the student-led demonstrations were far more powerful and widespread, attracting a much broader cross-section of society. By August 16, more than 20,000 people repeatedly chanted, “Down with dictatorship, long live democracy”, at Bangkok’s Democracy Monument.  This new generation of Thais are also harnessing technology to organize “flash” protests, bridging the gap between online and offline activism. Partly inspired by the Hong Kong movement, the Thai movement is largely leaderless, with participants primarily using social media to protest and mobilize more people throughout the nation. Anti-government sentiments and political discontent have spread quickly on social media, with various protest hashtags emerging on Twitter. Young protesters are also using various online platforms like Tinder and TikTok to spread their protest message, often using symbols, satire, and popular culture.  But while the Thai government has maintained that people are allowed to express their dissent and desire for reform, it has increasingly harassed, detained, and initiated criminal complaints against student leaders and protesters who took part in the peaceful protests. While the government said the emergency decree’s extension to September won’t prohibit political protests, the police continue to summon protest leaders for violating the decree. This means the protesters can still be arrested for attending demonstrations, along with sedition and other repressive laws under the Thai Penal Code.  Online, the shutdown of the Royalist Marketplace group on Facebook is a clear reflection of the dangers of expressing dissent against the Thai government and monarchy on the internet. The hashtag #NoTwitterThailand topped the country’s trending page in May as Thais grow increasingly critical of the government’s online surveillance and curtailment of freedom of expression. [This is linked to the launch of Thailand's official Twitter account in May which was followed by Twitter's privacy policy changes. This led many Thai activists to suspect about an intensified government surveillance].  Local media has also opened up about systematic censorship when it came to any coverage critical of the Thai monarchy.  Between August 17 and 19, Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) documented 103 cases where students have been harassed or prevented from speaking their minds, including making the three-fingered salute, wearing white ribbons, or holding pieces of blank paper.  When Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan tried to get on the stage to speak, @BadStudent chanted at him: “Get in line. Get in line. Get in line.” #WhatsHappeningInThailand #ผูกโบว์ขาวต้านเผด็จการ #เลิกเรียนไปกระทรวง pic.twitter.com/l5KNPtOJdy — Thisrupt (@Thisruptdotco) August 19, 2020  At least 13 activists, including human rights lawyer Anon Nampa and two rappers, were arrested with the sedition charge, and they each could face prison sentences of up to seven years if convicted.  At the time of writing, all were later released on bail. However, some activists have been tailed by security officers in plain clothes, and they believe that there is a list of 31 people that the police seek to arrest for speaking onstage. Because many of the protesters are students, there is increasing concern about the potential targeting of schoolchildren and young people amid the ongoing protests."

Photo / Getty Images  As Asia Media Centre's Lee Seabrook-Suckling recalls his grandfather's gambling problem and looks at gambling within the Kiwi-Asian community.  COMMENT:  Growing up as a young child in Canterbury, I have fond memories of visiting my grandfather at his large rural homestead. ""Grandad is rich!"", my brothers and I used to muse on the tree-lined drive into his property.  By the time Grandad died when I was age 12, he was living in a caravan park. His wife, my step-grandmother, had left him and returned to the Philippines as their relationship had been torn apart. The reason he went from extravagant riches to lonely rags? Like many other Asian Kiwis, he was a gambler.  During the first Covid-19 lockdown in New Zealand, 49.8 per cent of New Zealanders of Asian descent engaged in online gambling. According to a poll by Asian Family Services, this is significantly higher than the general national average - which is only 30.2 per cent.  Sixty-six per cent of Asians in New Zealand have participated in gambling in the past 12 months. The most likely activities are buying a Lotto, Strike, or Powerball ticket. From flashy casinos to online poker, gambling comes with a dopamine hit and is accompanied by a satisfying feeling of being lucky improving one's quality of life through monetary gain.  Local studies have found Asian communities in New Zealand are vulnerable to gambling addiction for cultural reasons. According to research by the University of Auckland, Asian people are susceptible gamblers because of their ""cultural beliefs and values in superstition and luck"". As the Chinese have these notions well-embedded in their culture, they are the most predisposed group of all Asian ethnicities.  The Chinese have a saying: ""If you don't gamble, you don't know how lucky you are"". This references the compulsive and addictive nature of gambling and how entwined games such as mahjong, poker, blackjack, and dice games are with Chinese values of luck, numerology, fate, and fortune. According to Psychology Today, winning (and, thus, losing) in Chinese culture comes with a heavier sense of identification than in the West and can be very tied up with one's sense of self.  Researcher Andrew Zhu, who conducted the Asian Family Services poll, says: ""In most Asian countries, the lottery is promoted as a charitable act (as well as in New Zealand). Among the 20 people interviewed, none of them classified themselves as a gambler and they believed buying the lottery was a way to give back to the community, however 'not buying it', means missing the opportunity to win a superior lifestyle."" In New Zealand, Zhu's research has found the typical Asian gambler is a Chinese woman over 50, who is retired, and has been in the country for less than a year.  For my grandfather, a Chinese-Kiwi retiree in his 60s, any type of gambling would do. The Christchurch Casino has the same lure as the Addington Raceway and the Lotto counter at New World. Every week until he died, I recall him frequenting all three.  Being a recent migrant is a driver for gambling among Asians who move to Western countries. This likely owes to the sense of community that casinos and pubs/clubs can provide. Gambling can easily become a form of socialisation for those who seek social inclusion, and, as Psychology Today notes, casinos ""have capitalised on this by marketing aggressively to Asians - especially Asian immigrants - by offering Asian entertainers, ethnic food, free transportation, and even card dealers who speak Asian languages"".  Tendencies towards gambling aren't just a Chinese phenomenon within the Asian context. In Japan, it's estimated 3.2 million people are addicted to some form of gambling – the popular form called ""pachinko"". This arcade form of gambling is similar to the Western ""slot machines"" style of gambling, and while technically illegal, there are more than 12,000 pachinko parlours across Japan which don't have to form to criminal laws because of their cultural value.  Illegal casinos are extremely popular in Thailand - despite very strict laws against it. A 2019 report found 57 per cent of Thais gamble and the youngest gambler interviewed was seven years old. In the United States, refugees from Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam have an astonishing pathological gambling prevalence rate of 59 per cent in this South Eastern population. Why? According to gambling researcher Timothy Fong of UCLA, gambling lures in people from lower socio-economic groups with ""an opportunity out of poverty"".  There's an ecological approach to reducing problem gambling and addiction in Asian Kiwi communities, University of Auckland researchers Amritha Sobrun-Maharaj and Fiona Rossen believe. ""Asian culture has strengths that can be protective against gambling and should be utilised,"" they explain. ""These strengths lie in values such as family connectedness and respect, spirituality and religion, the stigma attached to gambling, as well as the need to save face.""  Indeed, Sobrun-Maharaj and Rossen say, solutions lie in normalising help-seeking (seeking help for mental health is not the norm in Asian societies) by changing perceptions around talking about addiction. I know if my grandfather were alive today, he would not admit to his obvious addiction, because that is not something a Chinese-Kiwi family from the South Island does.  Help-seeking, therefore, should involve providing culturally appropriate services, creating awareness about problem gambling behaviours, enhancing support for reconstructing families (including extended families), and teaching alternate ways of stress relief. Moreover, important in tackling this issue are more appropriate social spaces for Asian people (especially recent migrants) when they're in the early stages of integration into New Zealand society.    - Asia Media Centre    Author: Lee Seabrook-Suckling  Author Profile"

Quick Fix  — U.S. apparel groups are bracing for a Trump administration decision as early as this week that could block the importation of Chinese-made textile and apparel products on the grounds that they are the products of forced labor in the Uighur region of China.  Advertisement  — The race to see who becomes the World Trade Organization’s next director general has moved one step closer to conclusion, following the end of the summer campaign stage on Monday.  — U.S. apparel groups are pressing for quick renewal of legislation allowing Haiti and other Caribbean countries to export clothing and certain other items to the U.S. without paying duties. The program will expire on Sept. 30, unless lawmakers renew it.  IT’S TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 8! Welcome to Weekly Trade, where we believe nobody captures the melancholy side of the ninth month of the year better than Willie Nelson singing this Kurt Weill classic tune. Got a cure for September sadness, or even a news tip to share? Let us know [email protected], [email protected] and [email protected].  Driving the Day  CBP COULD TAKE ACTION AGAINST XINJIANG COTTON PRODUCTS: In a new petition filed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the AFL-CIO and allied groups pushed for a regional “withhold release order” on cotton and cotton-containing products from Xinjiang, which they said would force China to choose “between continuing the persecution of the Uighur people or face the exodus of billions of dollars in business contracts and investments from U.S. companies and others.”  But apparel industry groups already have been increasingly concerned about the potential for CBP to take action, even before the new petition was filed. “I would say most companies and trade associations paying attention to this issue have known that [U.S. Customs and Border Protection] could issue an order like this since probably late 2018,” John Foote, a trade attorney at Baker McKenzie who has been tracking the issue, said in an email.  A withhold release order, or WRO, is not an actual import ban. But goods subject to a WRO have to be re-exported or destroyed if CBP determines they were made with forced labor.  A regional WRO has the potential to affect tens of billions of dollars of U.S. textile and clothing imports that contain cotton, yarn or fabric produced in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. It also could boomerang back on U.S. cotton producers if Beijing is provoked into retaliation.  Big producer: Xinjiang accounts for 85 percent of Chinese cotton production. The U.S. imported about $50 billion worth of textiles and clothing from China last year, and Uighur cotton, yarn and fabric is used by other countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to make clothing.  Policing that volume of imports would be a massive CBP undertaking, raising questions about whether the agency would take on a project that big or decide on a more targeted approach.  “When a WRO is issued, it takes immediate effect,” Foote said in a Q&A with POLITICO. “Shipments in transit will be affected, and many such shipments will be detained. In theory, every shipment of goods described by the WRO should be detained pursuant to the WRO.”  WTO RACE MOVES INTO NEXT STAGE: Who could be first on the WTO candidate chopping block? To answer that question, a trio of top officials have started consultations with WTO members to winnow down the eight current contenders to just five by the end of next week.  Four candidates were seen by several Washington trade professionals as most vulnerable: Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh from Egypt, Tudor Ulianovschi from Moldova, Mohammad Maziad Al-Tuwaijri of Saudi Arabia and Liam Fox from the U.K.  Out front: The three female candidates — Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria, Yoo Myung-hee of South Korea and Amina Mohamed of Kenya — are expected to survive the first round, along with Jesús Seade Kuri of Mexico. The two African women are still seen as leading the pack, setting the stage for a potential impasse if they end up being the last candidates. But news that Okonjo-Iweala holds an American passport could hurt her chances with some delegations.  Each WTO member can state up to four preferences in the first round of consultations, which wrap up Sept. 16. After the final five are selected, there will be two more rounds of campaigning and consultations to winnow the list down to two individuals and then to the winner, according to the WTO website.  The U.S. view: USTR declined to say who it is supporting in the first round. But one former trade official expected the U.S. to line up behind the Mexican, South Korean and U.K. candidates.  U.S.-U.K. TALKS RESUME TODAY: U.S. and U.K. trade negotiators begin their virtual fourth round of talks today on a free trade agreement, which are slated to last through Sept. 18. The two sides were scheduled to exchange market access offers for the first time ahead of this round.  In the face of uncertainty over when a final deal will be reached, some British businesses are pushing for a smaller agreement that would remove U.S. retaliatory tariffs on dozens of U.K. goods, including single-malt Scottish whiskey and a variety of cheeses.  The Airbus factor: The WTO authorized USTR to impose those duties because of the EU’s failure to comply with rulings against subsidies provided by the U.K., Germany, France and Spain for the European aerospace giant Airbus.  Some U.K. food and beverage groups are proposing the U.S. drop those tariffs in exchange for the U.K. dropping the tariffs it has imposed on Kentucky bourbon and other U.S. goods in retaliation for Trump’s tariffs on U.K. steel.  The tariffs are “clearly still a major problem and a real blocker to progress” in the free trade talks with the U.S., Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation told our colleagues at Morning Trade UK. “While you have these sorts of barriers in place, I don't think it's particularly conducive to constructive negotiation.”  CLOTHES IMPORTERS PRESS FOR CARIBBEAN PROGRAM RENEWAL: Apparel groups are pressing for congressional action on the Caribbean Basin Promotion Act before its expiration at the end of the month. First passed in 2000, the CBTPA provides duty- and quota-free access for apparel made in eligible countries, as long as the fabrics are made and cut in the United States. It builds on a larger trade preference program, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, which has been in place since 1983 and has no expiration date.  Haiti is the CBTPA’s biggest beneficiary since many other members, such as the Dominican Republic and six countries in Central America, now have free trade agreements with the United States. The fast-approaching expiration means U.S. importers could be forced to pay duties on any clothing from Haiti that arrives after Sep. 30.  Lighthizer’s support sought: The American Apparel and Footwear Association and other apparel groups have urged U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to throw his weight behind early renewal of the program. So far, Lighthizer has not spoken on the subject. However, he has expressed reservations about renewal of the largest U.S. trade preference program, known as the Generalized System of Preferences, which expires at the end of the year.  NCTO’s view: The National Council of Textile Organizations, the main U.S. textile industry group, supports CBTPA renewal in its current form, with one important caveat — that it not be “tied to other unrelated trade and tariff provisions that would be detrimental to U.S. and regional manufacturers,” Rebecca Tantillo, a NCTO spokesperson said.  More specifically, NTCO opposes an expansion of GSP benefits to textile and apparel products that “would redirect critical benefits intended for participants in CBTPA … to foreign competitors in Asia that already enjoy considerable and growing U.S. apparel import market share,” she said.  The House Ways and Means Committee’s trade subcommittee will hold a hearing Thursday to examine whether to renew the CBTPA.  MANITOWOC CHANGES TUNE ON SECTION 232 TARIFFS: European and Japanese mobile crane companies can breathe a little easier because of Wisconsin-based Manitowoc's recent decision to no longer seek import duties on foreign competitors under the national security trade provision known as Section 232.  Manitowoc filed a petition with the Commerce Department this past December asking for the import duties and Secretary Wilbur Ross formally launched an investigation into the matter in May. But in a new set of comments filed in August, the company said it was no longer asking for tariffs to be imposed, thanks to economic changes driven by the coronavirus pandemic.  The company’s new president, Aaron Ravenscroft, sent a letter to customers the next day, saying it wanted Trump instead to take a number of steps to stimulate domestic demand, such as strengthening Buy American provisions and boosting infrastructure spending, American Cranes and Transport reported.  It’s not clear whether Manitowoc plans to formally withdraw its petition. A Commerce official said the department “cannot comment on ongoing investigations.”  International Overnight  — African trio sets out battlelines for decisive phase of WTO leadership contest, POLITICO Pro reports.  — Ireland nominates two very different candidates to replace former EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan, POLITICO Pro reports.  — Top U.S. lawmakers press Trump for deal soon in U.S.-Brazil ethanol talks, POLITICO Pro reports.  — China to launch initiative to set global data-security rules, the Wall Street Journal reports.  — China’s exports are surging despite the coronavirus and Trump’s tariffs, The New York Times reports.  — The New York Times also examines how Biden’s approach to China trade policy has changed over the past two decades.  — The Financial Times digs into Lighthizer’s big ideas for reforming the WTO.  — Cato analyst Simon Lester looks at whether the interim appeal arbitration process will preserve the WTO dispute settlement system.  — Commerce announces preliminary anti-dumping duties on certain corrosion inhibitors from China.

Oral sex and its associated factors among low-tier female sex workers (FSWs) have not been documented in the Chinese literature. Here, we report this perspective in this group.… [+41721 chars]","Oral sex practitioners among low-tier FSWs in China are at a higher risk of STI, HIV, and unwanted pregnancy compared to those who did not engage in oral sex. Behavioral interventions carried out among low-tier FSWs should specifically target low-tier FSWs who practice oral sex, should carefully take into account the characteristics of these FSWs, provide risk awareness education and training for condom use negotiation, and promote the availability of condom and reproductive health care, timely diagnosis, and treatment of STIs.  Of all participants, 579 (21.9%) had performed oral sex with clients over the previous month. Multivariate analysis revealed that oral sex is related to being unmarried, low income, early initiation of commercial sex, having conducted commercial sex in more counties, longer duration of commercial sex, larger number of clients, ever having engaged in anal sex, less use of condoms and oral contraceptives during the previous month, low rate of adoption for contraception at the present time, and STI-related symptoms during the previous half year.  Although oral sex has been considered lower HIV-risk sexual behavior compared to vaginal and anal sexual behavior, evidence has shown that unprotected oral sex could be a route for HIV infection [ 22 , 23 ], as well as STI infection, such as HPV, HSV, gonorrhea, syphilis, Chlamydia trachomatis, chancroid, and Neisseria meningitidis [ 24 – 27 ]. Chinese studies have exhibited that oral sex is an important marker for a profile of high-risk sexual behavior. Those who practiced oral sex (versus those who did not) among heterosexual STD clinic attendees were more likely to initiate sex early, to have multiple sexual partners, and to conduct more frequent sex [ 17 ]. Oral sex practitioners among male college graduates have more sexual partners, more casual sexual partners, more sexual partners from other colleges, and from society, and use condoms less than those who do not practice oral sex [ 21 ]. FSWs, particularly low-tier FSWs, are at high risk of HIV/STI infection due to their frequent exposure to different sexual clients. However, there are few data on the characteristics of oral sex practitioners and their role in HIV/STI transmission among lower-tier FSWs in China. Therefore, it is important to investigate oral sex and related factors among low-tier FSWs, to help understand and create targeted intervention for this population.  Oral sex is one of the most common sexual activities in commercial sexual services provided by low-tier FSWs, with studies on older male clients of FSWs in the US [ 14 ] and Peru [ 15 ] reporting that over 95% had engaged in oral sex with FSWs or clients over their lifetime. One Chinese study documented that 43.5% of FSWs had practiced oral sex [ 16 ], with the prevalence of Chinese heterosexual STD clinic attendees at 6.9% [ 17 ]. Some studies have also reported the prevalence of oral sex among common Chinese people. For example, a study in Guangzhou reported that 63.7% of women aged 20–50 had practiced oral sex in their lifetime [ 18 ]. The prevalence of oral sex is increasing among Chinese people, with the rate for fellatio at 16.2%, 30.4%, 35.2%, and 36.8%, respectively, in 2000, 2006, 2010, and 2015, while it was 20.3%, 32.6%, 38.8%, and 36.8%, for penilingus [ 19 ]. The rate of oral sex ever practiced by sexually active college students [ 20 ] and male college graduates [ 21 ] is 35.5% and 20.2%, respectively.  To earn more money, low-tier FSWs must conduct sex with more clients, and provide high-risk sexual services [ 6 , 7 ]. Moreover, condom use negotiation with clients is difficult for this group, resulting in less condom use among low-tier FSWs [ 8 , 9 ]. Lower self-protection awareness, less condom use, low access to clinics, and high mobility of sex trade are all problems faced by low-tier FSWs related to HIV/STI transmission [ 5 , 6 , 10 , 11 ]. According to China national HIV/AIDs sentinel surveillance report from 2011 to 2015, low-tier FSWs exhibited higher than middle- and high-tier FSWs in HIV and syphilis prevalence, with a HIV prevalence of 0.1–0.2% in middle- and high-tier FSWs versus 0.4–0.6% in low-tier FSWs, and a syphilis prevalence of 1.6–1.9% in middle- and high-tier FSWs versus 3.6–4.6% in low-tier FSWs. A high prevalence of HIV and syphilis was found among Chinese low-tier FSWs [ 12 , 13 ]. Therefore, low-tier FSWs play an important role in facilitating HIV and STI transmission, and their high mobility could also introduce HIV/STI transmission from one place to another.  Female sexual workers (FSWs) are a high-risk population for human immunodeficiency (HIV) infections, and require intervention compared to the general female population. The risk of HIV infection among FSWs is 13.5 times higher than that of the general female population in low- and middle-income countries [ 1 ], and the prevalence of STIs is high among FSWs [ 2 – 4 ]. In terms of working place, FSWs can be categorized into low-, middle-, and high-tier levels based on their different socio-economic levels, types of client, price charged, etc., with low-tier FSWs lying at the lower socio-economic level, working in lower sex trade places such as roadside shops and on-street small venues, and usually providing sexual services to clients at a similar socio-economic level, such as those who are aged, poorer, and less educated, and for a low price sexual trade fee [ 5 – 7 ].  Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (Version 17.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The prevalence of self-reported oral sex and the frequency distributions of the independent variables were determined using bivariate analysis. The association between the dependent variable and each independent variable was computed using an odds ratio (OR) with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and a P-value based on a chi-square test of proportions. Variables identified as significantly associated with self-reported oral sex in the bivariate analyses were then entered into the logistic regression model to determine the independent contribution of each factor to predicting self-reported oral sex. A backward elimination procedure was used with a P value of >0.10 as the removal criteria. Chi-square analysis was used to compare the difference between those who performed oral sex and those who did not. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for these bivariate and multivariate analyses.  Self-reported oral sex with commercial clients during the previous one month was used as a dependent variable in the analysis. The independent variables included sociodemographic characteristics, factors related to sexual behavior, HIV/STI risk perception, and self-efficacy scale regarding condom use. The scale measuring self-efficacy regarding condom use consisted of three statements addressing whether a participant could persuade a client to use a condom when a client refused to do so during a sexual encounter, whether she could refuse sex when a client refused to use a condom, and whether she could insist on using a condom with clients every time. The possible responses were “I can,” “I can’t,” and “I’m not sure.” The scores for this scale ranged from 0 to 3, with 3 reflecting a high level of self-efficacy, 1–2 reflecting a middle level of self-efficacy, and 0 reflecting a low level of self-efficacy. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for this scale was 0.923.  The questionnaire used in this study was developed based on instruments used for HIV sentinel surveillance among FSWs and reviews of domestic and foreign literature regarding low-tier FSWs; it was then revised once more through repeated discussions within the research team and consultation with the staff of the CDCs who were responsible for behavioral interventions with FSWs in the counties studied. Finally, the questionnaire was modified through two pilot surveys with low-tier FSWs in two counties.  All participants who met the recruitment criteria were invited to voluntarily participate in the study, and informed of the study’s purpose, method, and that their privacy and confidentiality would be strictly protected. The interviews were conducted in a private, quiet space within the venues. The staff of local centers for disease control and prevention (CDCs), who were trained by research teams prior to the study, interviewed the participants using an anonymous questionnaire. Considering the low education background of the participants, oral consent was obtained from each participant, then recorded by ticking the box following the Chinese word “agree” at the beginning of the questionnaire. The study protocol including consent procedure was approved by the ethics committee of Zhejiang provincial center for disease prevention and control.  FSWs who met the recruitment criteria were regarded as lower-tier FSWs, who were recruited as research participants if they were currently engaging in sex work on the street and/or at small venues, including hair salons, roadside shops, and other venues with fewer than nine FSWs. All the counties participating in this study conducted a survey to confirm the location of low-tier FSWs in their area and then developed a plan to complete this study.  Those FSWs who engaged in commercial sex in two counties (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.17–2.16) and those working in three or more counties (OR = 2.13, 95%CI = 1.60–2.84) versus those engaging in commercial sex in just one county; those who had engaged in commercial sex for 13–24 months (OR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.78–3.42), or for over 24 months (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.73–3.11) versus those who had worked for 1–12 months; those who had experienced commercial sex with 16–30 partners (OR = 2.95, 95% CI = 2.22–3.93), and with over 30 partners (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.60–3.00) versus those who had had fewer partners; those who had experienced anal sex versus those who had not (OR = 9.42, 95%CI = 6.00–14.80); and those who had shown STI-related symptoms during the previous 6 months (OR = 1.57, 95%CI = 1.15–2.13) versus those who had not, were more likely to engage in oral sex.  Controlling for possible confounding variables, multivariate analysis revealed that those FSWs who were married or cohabiting (OR = 0.65, 95%CI = 0.48–0.89), and those who were widowed or divorced (OR = 0.56, 95%CI = 0.34–0.92) versus those who were unmarried, earned an income of 3000–4000 RMB (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.44–0.78), and over 4000 RMB (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.47–0.85), those who had initiated sex at the age of 26–30 years (OR = 0.62, 95%CI = 0.43–0.89) or over 30 years (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.24–0.56) versus those who had initiated sex at age 20 or less; those who always used a condom versus those who never/sometimes used a condom (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.41–0.75); those who always used oral contraceptive versus those who never/sometimes used it (OR = 0.39, 95%CI = 0.22–0.67); and those who used contraception versus those who did not (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.54–0.90), continue to be less likely to use condoms ( Table 4 ).  Those who engaged in commercial sex in two counties (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.60–2.08), those working in three or more counties (OR = 3.94, 95%CI = 3.15–4.94) versus those engaging in commercial sex in one county; those who had engaged in commercial sex for 13–24 months (OR = 3.22, 95% CI = 2.45–4.24), and for over 24 months (OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 2.17–3.39) versus those who had worked for 1–12 months; those who had experienced commercial sex with 16–30 partners (OR = 4.06, 95% CI = 3.17–5.21), and over 30 partners (OR = 2.68, 95% CI = 2.06–3.47) versus those who had had fewer partners; those who had experienced anal sex versus those who had not (OR = 11.35, 95% CI = 7.64–16.85); those who had shown STI-related symptoms during the previous 6 months (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.64–2.71) versus those who had not; those diagnosed with an STI versus those not (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.31–2.90) among those who had seen a doctor for STI diagnosis and treatment during the previous 6 months; those who believed that they were likely to contract STIs versus those who believed it was unlikely or unsure that they would contract STIs (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.99–2.90); those who believed that it was likely that they might contract HIV versus those who believed it was impossible or who were unsure whether they might contract HIV (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.56–2.36), were more likely to engage in oral sex. Having seen a doctor during the previous six months was not associated with experience of oral sex.  Bivariate analysis indicated that the FSWs who were negatively associated with oral sex were those who had initiated commercial sex at the age of 26–30 years (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.44–0.75) or over 30 years (OR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.20–0.38) versus those who had initiated sex at the age of 20 or less than 20; those who always used condoms versus those who never/sometimes used condoms (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.41–0.59); those who always used oral contraceptives versus those who never/sometimes used them (OR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.16–0.43); those who used contraception versus those who did not use them (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.67–0.97)(Contraception refers to intrauterine devices, tubal ligation, or the Norplant method; those FSWs who adopted one of these measures were considered to be using contraception); and those who had a score of 1–2 (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.51–0.92) or 3 (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.48–0.71) on the condom-use self-efficacy scale versus those who had a score of 0 on this scale were negatively associated with experience of oral sex ( Table 3 ).  Bivariate analysis indicated that participants’ residence was not associated with self-reported oral sex. The FSWs aged 26–35 years (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.59–0.90) and over or equal to 36 years (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.38–0.63) compared with those under 26 years, those who were married or cohabiting (OR = 0.54,95%CI = 0.44–0.66), and those who were widowed or divorced (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.29–0.64) were negatively associated with oral sex compared with those who were unmarried, and those who earned 3000–4000 RMB (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.50–0.78), and over 4000 RMB (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.57–0.91). The FSWs who had received junior high school education (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = .12–1.67) were positively associated with oral sex compared with those who had received primary school education at most, those who worked from hair salons (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.19–2.17), roadside shops (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 2.09–4.39), or other (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.44–3.13), or those who worked on the streets.  In total, 579 participants (21.9%) had performed oral sex with clients over the previous month, while 2666 (78.1%) had not. Of those who had performed oral sex in this time period, 81.0% (469) had also conducted vaginal sex, 16.4% (329) had also performed both vaginal sex and anal sex, 0.3% (2) had also performed anal sex with a client, and 2.2% (13) had only performed oral sex with a client ( Table 2 ).  The sociodemographic characteristics of the oral-sex group and non-oral sex group are described in Table 1 . In total, of the 2645 participants, 31.8% were 25 years or younger, while 27.4% were aged over 35 years. Overall, 10.2% were from the local area. Regarding education, 36.8% had received, at most, primary school education, while 53.1% had received junior high school education; 28.7% were unmarried and 62.5% were married or cohabiting. In terms of financial status, 28.2% earned an income of less than 3000 Yuan per month, while 40.4% earned 3000–4000 Yuan (one Yuan is equal to approximately 0.14 US dollars). The working venues for respondents were the street (15.6%), hair salons (63.5%), roadside shops (10.5%), and other (10.2%).  Discussion  To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first research of its kind to examine factors associated with oral sex among low-tier FSWs in China. We reported that the prevalence of oral sex practiced by low-tier FSWs in this study was 21.9%. Since we only measured this prevalence during the previous month, we are not able to compare this result with overseas FSWs [14, 15] or those in China [16], nor could we compare these data with those of common Chinese people [18, 19], since previous studies have all used measures based on lifetime prevalence. However, we believe that the relatively large sample size and relatively high prevalence of oral sex during the previous month among our participants could guarantee the generalizability of our study findings, and the comparability between the results of this study and other related literature. Another reason for the incomparability of the prevalence of oral sex between this study and other related studies is that these studies were conducted in different years following a revolution in sexual practices in China since 2000, and the subsequent dramatic increase in sexual behaviors traditionally adopted by few common people in China, such as oral and anal sex [19]. We speculate that the prevalence of oral sex among FSWs might also have increased quickly due to this trend in these years. The amazing rise in prevalence of oral sex among FSWs, with a concomitant increase in pharyngeal gonorrhea, has been reported in Singapore [28], pointing to the importance of this study.  Our study found that 2.2% of oral sex practitioners only practiced oral sex with their clients; the remaining majority have not only engaged in oral sex, but also in vaginal and/or anal sex, indicating that oral sex is just one type of commercial sexual service provided to clients. Previous studies have shown that low-tier FSWs are at a lower socio-economic level than higher-tier FSWs [5–7]. The income of those low-tier FSWs who practice oral sex is lower than those not performing oral sex in our study, implying that the economic situation of oral sex practitioners might be worse than that of other low-tier FSWs. This suggests that, due to economic reasons, they might be more willing to provide oral sex, or unable to reject clients’ requests for oral sex, anal sex, and unprotected sex.  Low-tier FSWs were more mobile than other economic levels of FSW [29]. We found that approximately 56% of low-tier FSWs engaged in commercial sex in two or more counties, and the more likely they were to perform oral sex for clients, the more counties in which they perform commercial sex. FSWs were highly mobile, with reasons for changing residence and working locations most commonly related to increasing income. FSWs working in higher risk venues where they charge less have many characteristics in common with HIV positive and drug using FSWs, who have been found to be more mobile than those from other establishments [11]. Mobility among FSWs has been assumed to contribute to the spread of HIV, and HIV may spread to low-risk areas through mobile FSWs [30, 31]. Thus, importance should be attached to the mobility of FSWs who practice oral sex, particularly to reduce their risk of HIV/STI transmission in behavioral intervention, and to provide information about support facilities such as VCT clinics in different areas.  Our results indicate a significant association between occurrence of oral sex and longer duration of sex work. Prolonged length of sex work might increase the likelihood of oral sex; however, longer duration of sex work is an independent risk factor for STIs [32] and HIV infection [33]. Though some foreign studies have conversely documented that STI infections are higher in those with a shorter compared to those with a longer period of sex work [34–36], the risks of HIV/STI infection resulting from long duration of sex work among FSWs who practice oral sex should be noted in the Chinese context. We further compare the difference between those FSWs who engaged in commercial sex for 1–12 months and those who have practiced for over 12 months, and found that FSWs who had been engaged in sex work for a long duration were more likely to have had over 15 sexual clients (72.3% Vs. 48.3%) and never/sometimes use a condom (53.9% Vs. 41.3%) during the previous month, to report STI-related symptoms (13.4% Vs.9.9%), and to have been diagnosed with an STI in those who had seen a doctor (21.8% Vs. 12.3%) during the previous half year.  We found that those who practiced oral sex were more likely to report ever having been diagnosed with an STI among FSWs who had seen a doctor during the previous half year in the bivariate analysis. This study provides further evidence that oral sex practitioners are more likely to report STI-related symptoms. Low-tier FSWs are more likely to report STIs [24–26] and genital symptoms [29] than higher-tier FSWs. We concluded, therefore, that of low-tier FSWs, oral sex practitioners are more vulnerable to STI infection than those who do not practice oral sex.  It is well understood that the risk of HIV infection and transmission during anal sex is significantly higher than during vaginal sex [37–39]. Though only 5% of our study participants reported practicing anal sex with their clients during the previous month, anal sex practice is the strongest predictor of oral sex in this study. These FSWs might conduct both oral and anal sex with their clients because they are more obedient to client requests in order to secure a deal in the sex trade, emphasizing that HIV prevention interventions should not ignore those practicing oral and anal intercourse to prevent HIV transmission.  Our study demonstrated that oral sex is a strong indicator of lower age of first instance of commercial sex, consistent with a previous Chinese study that oral sex practitioners are more likely to initiate sex at a younger age [17]. Sex initiation at a lower age has been confirmed to be related to having more sexual partners, having sex more frequently, diagnosis with an STI, history of pregnancy, induced abortion, and less condom and oral contraceptive use, compared with late initiators [40, 41]. Early age of sex initiation is also a predictor of HIV infection among sex workers in the Chinese literature [42]. These early initiators of commercial sex might be at greater risk of HIV/STI transmission, unwanted pregnancy, and induced abortion than other FSWs, and this should be considered an important indicator for intervention in low-tier FSWs.  There is more evidence to support the above arguments. In this study, oral sex practitioners are related to less use of condoms or oral contraceptives during the previous month and contraception use. We reported that only approximately 8% of oral sex practitioners always use oral contraceptives, 16% had always used condoms during the previous month, and 20% were currently adopting contraception measures. We reported that approximately 80% of oral sex practitioners are aged under 35 years, and they are more likely to be unmarried. Oral sex practitioners are mostly at the reproductive age. These results indicate a relatively low awareness of reproductive health, and a large unmet need in this respect in this group of low-tier FSWs, underscoring the need to expand FSW-friendly reproductive health services in Zhejiang province. The structural interventions, such as increasing condom availability in sex trade establishments, distribution of condoms free of charge by outreach workers, accessible reproductive-health services, and provision of reproductive health education may improve their reproductive health outcomes.  Sixteen percent of oral sex practitioners had used condoms consistently during their commercial sex in the previous month versus 51.2% of the total participants, and oral sex is significantly related to less condom use in this study. However, our multivariate analysis indicates that oral sex practitioners did not increase their likelihood of self-efficacy for condom use and risk perception for HIV and STI infection. Low condom use is common among FSWs in China [16]. The main purpose for which FSWs use condoms is for contraception, not for prevention of HIV and other STIs [43]. Only a small proportion of FSWs have access to condoms at their sex trade places [44], with the majority of women having to buy condoms themselves [16]. Half of FSWs had had the experience of condom breakage or slippage during sex [16]. Their lack of negotiating power and fear of losing clients resulted in low condom use among FSWs [45]. Low-tier FSWs reported a lower rate of condom use than higher tier FSWs, perhaps driven by the desire for more clients and higher trade fees, and hampered by their limited ability to negotiate for safer sex practices [8, 9, 29, 46]. Therefore, comprehensive intervention with multiple components, including addressing the barriers to condom use mentioned above, should be carried out among oral sex practitioners of low-tier FSWs. Multiple session interventions may be required as the condom use is so low in this group, and multiple session intervention has been found to be more effective than single session intervention for increasing condom use among FSWs [47].  We are not clear about the rate of condom use in oral sex, but could speculate that oral sex is much less protected than other sex practices. Foreign studies have shown that oral sex among FSWs and their clients is less protected [14, 15]. One Chinese study revealed that 70.1% of FSWs always used condoms to protect themselves when they had vaginal sex with clients, and this figure was 57.9% for anal sex but only 22.7% for oral sex [16]. Those oral sex practitioners are at risk of HIV/STI infection through oral sex, vaginal sex, and anal sex. Oral sex is also associated with more commercial clients in this study. These FSWs also place more clients at risk of infection once infected.  This study offers new insights into the oral sex related factors among Chinese FSWs. Our study is subject to several limitations, however. First, the cross-sectional nature of this study did not allow cause-and-effect relationships to be established between low-tier FSWs engaged in oral sex and risk behaviors. Second, we conducted this investigation in 21 counties during a limited time period, and the FSWs included in this study may have been more accessible and more willing to participate. The results presented in this article may not be generalizable to the whole province or to China. Third, our findings may be limited by the validity of self-reported measures, as our questionnaire contained some sensitive sexual behavior questions [48], and social desirability may have resulted in over- or under-reporting of sexual behaviors. Fourth, recall bias may occur to FSWs in our study, due to their education status and working environment, though we tried to interview them on sexual behaviors mainly in the previous month."

Southeast Asia’s top diplomats are holding their annual summit with the coronavirus pandemic and rising tensions in the South China Sea amid escalating rivalry between the United States and China topping the agenda.  The 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit began via video link on Wednesday after being delayed by a month due to the pandemic.  The foreign ministers of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are also set to meet Asian and Western counterparts during the summit.  Russia, Japan, Australia, South Korea and India are among those remotely joining the event hosted by Vietnam that will also include a 27-nation security forum.  “While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold in a complex manner, and our people and businesses continue to be outstretched by its repercussions, the regional geopolitical and geo-economic landscape, including the South China Sea, are witnessing growing volatilities that endanger peace and stability,” Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in his opening address.  His speech came at a time when China, the US, and several Southeast Asian nations remain embroiled in a tense standoff over actions in the South China Sea.  South China Sea dispute  The long-thorny issue on the agenda is the territorial disputes in the South China Sea involving China, Taiwan and ASEAN members Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.  Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea as its territory and has carried out live-fire drills in the area in recent months.  The US has responded by sending in warships and flying military planes over China’s naval exercises.  In July, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that Washington regards virtually all of China’s maritime claims in the disputed offshore region outside of its internationally recognised waters to be illegitimate.  The Trump administration effectively sided with the four ASEAN claimant states, along with Indonesia, which have all opposed China’s claims.  China then accused the US of sowing discord in the strategic region. Last month, its military reportedly test-fired two missiles in the South China Sea during exercises.  “The South China Sea issue must be managed and resolved in a rational manner,” Malaysia’s Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told the meeting. “We must all refrain from undertaking activities that would complicate matters in the South China Sea. We have to look at all avenues, all approaches to ensure our region is not complicated further by other powers.”  China has pushed for the resumption of negotiations with ASEAN on a code of conduct aimed at preventing armed clashes in the disputed waters even as it asserts its claims. This week defence minister Wei Fenghe has been touring Southeast Asia to meet regional counterparts.  Pompeo and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, have confirmed their attendance at the ASEAN Regional Forum, which will also be done by video.  North Korea’s foreign minister will skip the forum, but its representative to ASEAN will participate, according to Vietnam’s foreign ministry.  Coronavirus pandemic  Also on the agenda is the crisis in the region created by the coronavirus pandemic.  The pandemic has delayed or cancelled dozens of meetings and shut out the colourful ceremonies, group handshakes and photo-ops that have been the trademarks of ASEAN’s annual gatherings.  Earlier this week, Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Quoc Dung said the talks would continue to focus on a regional response to the pandemic and ways to help member states recover economically.  The contagion has devastated the region’s manufacturing, export, travel and tourism industries and sparked the worst economic recessions in decades across the region of 650 million people.

The Philippines and Indonesia each have more than double the infections reported by China, where the outbreak started late last year.  A senior Southeast Asian diplomat said a key project is establishing a COVID-19 response fund to help ASEAN member states buy medical supplies and protective suits.  The diplomat said Thailand has pledged to contribute $100,000 and ASEAN partners, including China, Japan and South Korea, were expected to announce contributions.  A regional stockpile of medical supplies has also been approved, and a study to be financed by Japan will research the possibility of establishing an ASEAN centre on public health emergencies, according to the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly."

HANOI (Reuters) - Southeast Asian foreign ministers kicked off a series of regional summits on Wednesday expected to seek collaboration to fight global threats, and to … [+2830 chars]","TipRanks  Out on Wall Street, who has been leading the charge forward? Tech. After the space’s key players dragged the market lower in September due to overheated valuations, tech is once again at the helm.The rise in tech makes sense. The pandemic helped accelerate a move toward remote work and telecommuting, and this in turn has put a premium on tech products. From the 5G rollout, to improvements in semiconductor chips, to the expansion of IoT and smart device capabilities – tech is everywhere, and it’s growing fast.Bearing this in mind, we turned to Needham, which lands among the top ten on TipRanks’ list of Top Performing Research Firms, for some inspiration. The firm’s analysts highlight three tech stocks that appear especially compelling, noting at least 30% upside potential could be in store for each.We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull the details on these three tech picks, to find out what makes them such compelling opportunities.Silicon Motion (SIMO)Bringing extensive experience to the table, Silicon Motion provides high-performance storage solutions widely used in smartphones, PCs, data centers and commercial and industrial applications. Following a bang-up quarter, Needham believes this tech name has a bright future ahead.Writing for the firm, analyst Rajvindra Gill tells clients that based on SIMO’s preannouncement, Q3 sales are set to land 8% above his original forecast, with EPS also beating his estimate by $0.09.What was behind this solid showing? A recovery in client SSDs. In Q2, SIMO's client SSD business, specifically the module maker component, declined as NAND flash makers allocated NAND capacity away from client SSDs to hyperscalers, to support the spike in data consumption on the network. However, the opposite happened in Q3. Along with a pause in hyperscale spending, module customers were allocated additional NAND capacity as NAND pricing declined quarter-over-quarter.To this end, Gill thinks NAND pricing could decline another 5-10% quarter-over-quarter in Q4. He added, “We expect the decline in NAND pricing to further stimulate client SSD adoption in Q4 as this market is quiet price elastic, especially the channel markets.”To a lesser extent, a rebound in China handsets along with a continued ramp of 5G handsets contributed to SIMO’s strong performance, in Gill’s opinion.What’s more, the analyst argues that next-generation gaming consoles and desktop gaming could further boost SSD demand. Gill points out that based on reports from MSI, the board maker for Nvidia GPUs, demand for less expensive SSDs for higher-end gaming desktop computers is on the rise.Expounding on this, Gill stated, “This could be potentially COVID-19 related demand as more people (of all ages) stay home and find more time to play video games. Moreover, we expect SIMO to participate in the next-generation gaming consoles (PS5, Xbox) coming out in the Fall. SIMO is shipping its PCIe SSD controllers into five out seven of the NAND makers sold into the game consoles; we believe two out of five could be SIMO's suppliers.”If that wasn’t enough, even though the penetration rates for laptops remain relatively high at 80-90%, Gill believes attach rates for SSDs in the desktop market could accelerate, driving upside in CY21.Given all of the above, Gill stayed with the bulls. Along with a Buy rating, he keeps a $55 price target on the stock. Investors could be pocketing a gain of 30%, should this target be met in the twelve months ahead. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here)Turning to the rest of the Street, the bulls have it on this one. With 4 Buys and a lone Hold, the word on the Street is that SIMO is a Strong Buy. At $49.60, the average price target implies ~18% upside potential. (See SIMO stock analysis on TipRanks)Domo (DOMO)As a business cloud software specialist, Domo helps its customers integrate data from any source, turn data into live visualizations and extend BI into apps. Based on positive momentum as well as new deals, Needham thinks that now is the time to snap up shares.After the company reported impressive fiscal Q2 2021 results, 5-star analyst Jack Andrews stands squarely with the bulls. Revenue of $51.1 million blew both his and the consensus estimate out of the water. Additionally, subscription revenue, billings and non-GAAP EPS exceeded his expectations.“In our view, Domo appears to be benefiting from tailwinds related to the ongoing pandemic and improved sales execution (i.e. playbooks and an improving partner ecosystem) as it closed a notable amount of large deals within the quarter,” Andrews explained.According to management, demand for digitizing business processes and real-time analytics is accelerating as a result of the pandemic. It’s also seeing more customers allocate IT budgets to modernizing BI and gathering insights from dark data. To this end, DOMO finalized multiple over $100,000 deals in hard-hit industries like fitness and manufacturing. On top of this, it closed a multi-million dollar deal with one of the world's largest retailers that began with the initial use case of creating insights across its analytics stack, but now extends to new use cases such as an application for store restocking.Andrews also points out that momentum from the state-level COVID tracking continues to work in the company’s favor, as the state of Iowa expanded significantly and extended its contract by two years. With the help of a partner, it inked a seven-figure contract to power a public-facing website to track pandemic funding grants in early fiscal Q3 2021.What’s more, Andrews highlights the “encouraging commentary” from management on its path to cash flow breakeven, which should “alleviate any remaining financial concerns.”To sum it all up, Andrews stated, “We believe Domo has created a unique platform levered to the future requirements of enterprise analytics (self-service and scalability) without the exorbitant costs of implementation. As management executes changes in its sales strategy, we believe Domo, which trades at an EV/revenue multiple discount, can close the relative valuation gap to its Big Data software peer group.”In line with his optimistic approach, Andrews reiterated a Buy rating and $61 price target. This target puts the upside potential at 46%. (To watch Andrews’ track record, click here)When it comes to other Wall Street analysts, opinions are split evenly. With 3 Buys and 3 Holds assigned in the last three months, DOMO earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Clocking in at $47.17, the average price target implies 13% upside potential. (See Domo stock analysis on TipRanks)Everspin Technologies (MRAM)Last but not least, we have Everspin Technologies, which develops and manufactures discrete magnetoresistive RAM or magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) products, including Toggle MRAM and Spin-Transfer Torque MRAM (STT-MRAM) product families. While the company has faced headwinds recently, Needham believes that MRAM could be a long-term winner.Firm analyst Rajvindra Gill, who also covers SIMO, is a serious fan. Consistent with the broader industry, data center demand has been moderating, which coupled with COVID-19-related headwinds, resulted in Q3 sales guidance that missed the mark.It should be noted that STT-MRAM is almost completely data center, while Toggle has some data center exposure since Toggle is used in RAID controllers. Additionally, thanks to COVID-19, there has been a surge in data center demand in the first half of 2020, boding well for MRAM. However, by the end of Q2, there was an increase in customer inventory.“While this increase is partially due to supply chain concerns, we believe the main reason is a potential peak and expected slowdown in data center demand... However, we view the data center inventory digestion as a temporary setback, with a recovery expected in Q4,” the analyst commented.Adding to the good news, MRAM thought that COVID-19 would negatively impact its ability to secure new design wins. That said, design wins grew by 16% quarter-over-quarter in Q2, which is over three times higher than the prior-year quarter. Gill mentioned, “We expect growth to re-accelerate as the market recovers.”The company kicked off mass production shipments of 32Mb Toggle MRAM product to a growing set of customers, with it planning to add different package and temperature grades to expand to new customer applications. If that wasn’t enough, the second pivotal design win for MRAM’s 1Gb STT-MRAM product is expected to start production shipments in Q3 “into a persistent memory application for an OEM that sells into data center.”Although gross margins were temporarily soft for Toggle and STT-MRAM due to the work-from-home environment, Gill argues that in the next few quarters, margins for both are likely to recover, driven by manufacturing efficiencies and lower material procurement costs.Everything that MRAM has going for it convinced Gill to maintain his Buy rating. In addition to the call, he left the price target at $10, suggesting 44% upside potential. Looking at the consensus breakdown, it has been quiet when it comes to other analyst activity. As Gill is the only analyst that has published a review recently, MRAM has a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

Back in 2011, Belgium made it into the Guinness World Records for the dubious achievement of going through the longest peacetime period without a government. Clocking in at 589 days, this was more than 200 days ahead of its nearest contenders, Cambodia (354 days) and Iraq (289 days).  This record appeared unbeatable … until now.  Last month, Belgium broke its own record. The country is still being run by a caretaker government because its squabbling parties have not managed to agree on a governing coalition. This is despite marathon negotiating sessions and a continuous stream of brave knightly politicians tasked by King Philippe to slay the dragon of political polarisation but who get their fingers burned instead.  Coalition negotiations have moved beyond the more common colour-coding conventions (purple-green, rainbow, etc.) to be dubbed the “Vivaldi coalition” in a nod to the Italian composer’s violin concerti Four Seasons.  Like Antonio Vivaldi, Flemish liberal Egbert Lachaert (who is the 12th politician to lead the consultations to form a coalition since the elections way back in May 2019), has had the unenviable task of composing an agreement that, while not music to the ears of any party, can at least get socialists, liberals, greens and Christian democrats on both sides of the country’s widening language divide singing from the same hymn sheet.  Now it appears that Lachaert may have hit the right notes and a full agreement, including the thorny question of who is to become prime minister, is expected to be sealed by the end of this week.  Paradoxically, rather than throw Belgium’s embattled political system into total disarray or even collapse, the coronavirus crisis has provided them with more urgent and important matters to deal with.  However, this temporary reprieve from politics as usual will end in mid-September when caretaker premier Sophie Wilmes’s emergency mandate comes to an end. The acting prime minister has indicated that she is unlikely to seek a renewed mandate, which would involve a vote of confidence which she stands a strong chance of losing. This race against the clock is a significant factor behind this latest breakthrough.  Nevertheless, despite the progress made, it is open to question whether such a broad alliance will be stable and survive till the next election, especially given the destablising effect of the deep socioeconomic crisis gripping Europe and the world.  If the government falls again, it will be the unfortunate culmination of Belgium’s second major crisis in less than a decade. This raises the question of what is behind this systemic failure.  One factor is the attempt to keep the far-right out of government. However, with the far-right Vlaams Belang party performing strongly at the ballot box in 2019, maintaining this so-called cordon sanitaire (ie, the exclusion of the extremist party from government) is proving more difficult than ever. The Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie (N-VA), which is one of the two largest right-wing parties in Belgium and part of the negotiations, has been openly questioning the cordon sanitaire.  Another major issue is the growing political gulf separating Belgium’s two main regions. Francophone Wallonia tends to vote for more leftist and progressive parties, while Dutch-speaking Flanders generally prefers more conservative and right-wing parties.  This ideological divide, combined with growing animosity between Flemish nationalists and Francophone socialists, means that a coalition between the other largest party, the Parti Socialiste (PS) and the N-VA, is almost unthinkable.  Such a constellation would also likely be unworkable. This is partly ideological. The PS is social democratic, supports the European Union and believes in climate action, while the N-VA is free-market neo-liberal, Eurosceptical and downplays climate change. They also disagree fundamentally about the future of Belgium, with the PS believing in a united Belgium and the N-VA seeking to decentralise the country out of existence.  This growing polarisation has placed almost unbearable strain on the model of consensual politics, known colloquially as the “Belgian compromise”, that has so effectively defused tension and stopped conflicts from spinning out of control since the country’s founding in 1830.  In fact, the Belgian federal government has become so hollowed out, with decades of devolution effectively making regional governments more powerful, that many view the gradual death of Belgium as almost an inevitability.  As a naturalised Belgian citizen, I find this simmering disintegration of Belgium a shame – partly because I appreciate the eccentric appeal of this small multilingual, multicultural country.  Besides, although many believe that a country bringing together three official language communities (Dutch, French and German) is bound to fail the test of time and fall apart, I am convinced there is nothing inevitable about Belgium’s slow-burning implosion.  In my view, the country is falling apart not because of irreconcilable differences between its communities but as a result of a devolution process that has gone too far.  Belgium has had neither national parties nor national media for decades. Education, too, has been regionalised, as has, bizarrely, foreign policy. Even its prized healthcare system, one of the best in the world, has not been unaffected by this regionalisation, with nine ministers holding health-related portfolios.  This, rather than fundamental differences between Flemings and Walloons, has led to the drifting apart of the country’s constituent parts and a rise in distrust.  In reality, the difference between Belgium’s two regions are far smaller than the divergence between states and regions in larger countries, such as China, India, Russia or the United States.  In some ways, Walloon and Flemish Belgians – who are, as much as one can generalise about national characters, understated, reserved and do not take themselves too seriously – have more in common with each other than with the people with whom they share a language across the border.  This explains why, if Belgium were to split apart, Walloons would not support becoming part of France and Flemings are opposed to joining the Netherlands, judging by the anecdotal evidence I have seen over the years. Moreover, the two communities do not have pleasant historical memories of life under French or Dutch rule. In fact, Belgium was founded following a revolution by its predominantly Catholic population against the Protestant King William I of the Netherlands.  Instead, what is vastly more likely is that Flanders would become an even tinier independent state and Wallonia would keep the name Belgium and hope for future reunification.  The best way to halt the disintegration of Belgium and stop it from devolving into two irrelevant countries is to pursue a process of gradual reintegration that moves beyond the fossilised issue of language and looks towards the common interest of all Belgians.  A first step in that direction would be to reintegrate Belgium’s political system by reintroducing national parties. This would stabilise the volatile political system by making it easier to create coalitions, thereby reigniting the spirit of Belgian compromise.  Other steps would be to reintegrate the media, to help create greater awareness and understanding between the communities, and reform education so that every Belgian child receives full immersion in Dutch and French.  Belgium often strikes the outsider as quirky and surreal. But it makes no less sense as a country than any other and has, to its credit, avoided the kind of costly and destructive conflict that has brought other polarised societies to their knees. Let us hope that this sense of pragmatism and the country’s legendary capacity for “Belgian compromise” regain the upper hand.

Thanks … [+6731 chars]","A community wellness program is demonstrating the benefits of culturally sensitive mental health care for Cambodian Americans, a group that has struggled to benefit from mainstream services.  Thanks to in-language workshops about mental health and culturally specific social activities, the majority of participants reported reductions in symptoms of depression and past trauma, highlighting the need for such programs in marginalized communities.  The results are significant given the lack of culturally sensitive mental health care programs for Cambodians, said community leaders with the Cambodian Advocacy Collaborative, an association of five organizations in Southern California that conducted the program.  ""The reduction of symptoms of past trauma was really important for us,"" said Susana Sngiem, executive director of United Cambodian Community of Long Beach, part of the collective. ""The strategies that we provide really help our genocide survivors be able to cope with the trauma that they experience.""  Cambodians began migrating to the United States en masse in the 1970s and 1980s after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime, under which more than 2 million people died. A 2015 study in the journal Psychiatric Services found that 97 percent of its participants — all of whom had lived in Cambodia at some point during the regime — met criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder. The rate surpasses those of the U.S. population as a whole (about 3.5 percent) and of U.S. veterans (12 percent to 30 percent).  The program has four prongs: outreach and engagement to reduce the stigma of mental health issues in the Cambodian community; workshops to educate community members about topics like mental and physical wellness, signs of mental illness and how to cope with stress; case management to provide referrals needed for health and social services; and social support activities, such as Cambodian New Year celebrations, temple visits, water blessings for healing and positive energy, and potlucks.  Yat Touch at a community gardening activity at the Cambodian Association of America in Long Beach, Calif. Virak Ung  Preliminary data show that 57.7 percent of participants reported reductions in the effects of past trauma on their current well-being, while 69.3 percent of those with depression-related symptoms at the beginning of the program reported reductions in symptoms.  The findings are based on surveys collected from 179 participants.  In other findings, more than half of participants reported a reduction in the perceived stigma of mental illness, feeling less alone and being able to better distinguish cultural myth from facts related to contributors to and symptoms and treatment of mental illness.  Three former participants spoke highly of the program, which is funded by the Reducing Disparities Project of the California Department of Public Health's Office of Health Equity, and said they hope it will be offered long term so more in the Cambodian community can benefit.  Seang Vung, 65, said her biggest takeaway has been an understanding of what stress is.  ""Mental health in the Cambodian community is very stigmatized,"" she said through an interpreter, Sochetra Hong, a counselor and administrative assistant at the Cambodian Association of America in Long Beach, the lead organization of the collective. ""It helped me a lot with understanding stress, how to manage stress and how I can cope with my stress without having to use medication.""  Sok Sovanary, 47, said through Hong that she learned how to cope with stress by connecting with others — something she previously didn't do. She said she made new friends through the program.  Vung, Sovanary and another former participant, Rin Sem, 56, all said they enjoyed the program's social activities, especially the water blessing. They said they would recommend the program to their families and friends, because it expanded their understanding of mental health and equipped them with coping mechanisms for stress and depression.  Sem, Sovanary and Vung took part in the program, which included in-person gatherings, before the COVID-19 outbreak. The collective has since shifted its programming online, which has been challenging, Sngiem said.  A water blessing as a social activity in a wellness program in Long Beach, Calif. Virak Ung  United Cambodian Community of Long Beach has adapted by holding educational workshops over Zoom. It has also tried to move some social activities online, but some people have been unable to participate because of difficulty navigating technology, said Lavyn Tham, program manager of the organization's health equity program. Case managers are also calling participants up to three times a week partly as a substitute for suspended in-person social activities.  While organizations in the collective say they've seen the effectiveness of their community-based practices, they've struggled to get financial backing, because most funding bodies prioritize evidence-based research. The state health department's Office of Health Equity is addressing that by supporting and evaluating community-based practices through the California Reducing Disparities Project. Founded in 2009, the project works for mental health equity for African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders and LGBTQ+ people in California.  The Cambodian Advocacy Collaborative is one of 35 groups across the state pursuing community-based mental health practices over five years under a grant from the agency.  Download the NBC News app for breaking news and alerts  Corey Egel, a spokesman for the state health department, said in an email that the disparities project has shown that community-informed approaches and solutions increase resources and support for underserved communities.  The program's lead evaluator, Pari Sabado, director of community engagement and evaluation at the Center for Health Equity Research at California State University, Long Beach, said the program also provides the opportunity to empirically test community-defined practices. She said that while evidence-based practices — such as support groups — may work for one community, they may not necessarily be effective in another.  ""In the Cambodian community, mainstream services don't work,"" she said. ""We can't expect a Cambodian elder to sit in a support group.""  The collective and other organizations funded under the disparities project said that at the conclusion of the program, they will represent a model the state can follow to replicate strategies, approaches and knowledge, Egel said.  Sngiem, of United Cambodian Community of Long Beach, said she hopes the practices can be implemented in other Cambodian communities throughout the country.  ""Our hope is that with the data we're collecting that we can show evidence that these social activities are really important to the mental health work in the Cambodian community,"" she said.  CORRECTION (Sept. 16, 2020, 2 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the group conducting the mental health program. It is the Cambodian Advocacy Collaborative, not the Cambodian American Collective. It also misstated the number of groups in the collaborative. There are five, not six."

This reflects the Buddha’s basic instruction on how to work with our negative patterns: “Recognizing unwholesome states in the mind and replacing them with wholesome states.”  Wholesome states, such as generosity, gratitude, and patience, are soothing and gladdening to the mind. They support clear understanding and wise choices. Unwholesome states, such as lust, anger, and revenge, are doubly painful: they are painful feelings in themselves and they confuse the mind so we choose maladaptive responses to situations that only make things worse. That’s why they are called “hindrances” in classical Buddhism. They hinder clear thinking.  Entirely avoiding afflictive states (another term for hindrances) isn’t possible. Annoying things happen. The mind starts “growling” in response. Disappointment happens. The mind loses its buoyancy as hope disappears from it.  Frightening things happen to us. A nervous system built for survival leaps into action to counteract the danger. Calm goodwill may not help us in situations of actual danger, but it does help us move gracefully through the less dire tribulations of the mind—the Wows! and Phooeys! of daily life. Goodwill provides the ballast that supports clear understanding, moment-by-moment, of what is happening to us and what the most skillful response to it is.  “May all beings be peaceful and happy and come to the end of suffering” was the phrase I heard Maha Ghosananda, the senior Buddhist prelate of Cambodia, repeating to himself under his breath, all the while participating in a forum we both were part of.  Meditation: A Song of Metta  In my version of the metta (loving-kindness) prayer, I silently sing a song to myself, to the tune of “Happy Birthday,” when an affliction begins to arise. You too can sing it and give yourself the loving-kindness you need.  May I feel protected and safe  May I feel contented and pleased  May my body be strong  And may I live with ease  I’ve recently added two new verses that I find are necessary when an afflictive emotion has arisen strongly enough to be spawning an out-of-control mind-storm of confusion and ill will:  I am polluting my mind  It is turning into shit  I am mortgaging my happiness  So I am vowing to quit  I am concentrating on what is good  I am mindful of who is kind  I am amplifying my blessing  So I am purifying my mind  May I feel protected and safe  May I feel contented and pleased  May my body be strong  And may I live with ease  The tune is apt! Every mind-moment that arises free of afflictive emotions is a felicitous rebirth. Happy birthday to you!"

It faulted the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) for criticizing its policies, without engaging with the organisation.  A statement by its Director of Corporate Communications, Mr Isaac Okoroafor, last night read in full, “The attention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has been drawn to a recent press release titled ‘Matters of Urgent Attention’ by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), which calls into question some of the measures taken by the CBN to support the stability of our financial system and enable faster recovery of our economy, following the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Nigeria.  “As we all are aware, the impact of COVID-19 on countries across the world resulted in a significant downturn in the global economy. Consequently, countries including Nigeria were forced to impose lockdown measures in order to contain the spread of the pandemic. This action resulted in depressed economic activity in the first half of the year.  “Except for China and Vietnam, advanced, emerging and frontier market economies, all experienced significant negative growth in the first half of 2020, and some are currently in a recession. In response to these unfortunate events across the globe, central banks have embarked on measures aimed at stabilizing their respective economies by reducing lending rates, which declined to negative territory in several advanced economies, in addition to increasing the scale of their asset purchase programmes.  “Indeed, after reducing its Federal Funds rate to zero per cent, the US Federal Reserve Bank implemented a huge securities purchase programme, which included the purchase of corporate bonds (including those below investment grades). The Reserve Bank also provided credit facilities to non-bank institutions which included, money market funds and corporations.  ALSO READ:  “The balance sheet of the US Federal Reserve in support of these activities increased by over $3 trillion, while the European Central Bank expanded its balance sheet by over $1 trillion. Furthermore, the Bank of England in an unusual move gave an open check to the UK Government in order to fund its recovery efforts.  It is therefore pertinent to state that the Nigerian economy is not immune from these crises given the over 65 per cent drop in commodity prices; disruptions in global supply chains and the unprecedented outflow of over $100bn of debt and equity funds from emerging markets between March and May 2020; in addition to the impact of the lockdown on economic activities.  “These activities resulted in an over 60 per cent reduction in revenues due to the Federation Account, a significant drop in foreign currency inflows, which led to downward adjustments in the naira/dollar exchange rate and a rise in inflation due to the exchange rate pass-through effect of imported inflation.  The Central Bank of Nigeria like other Central Banks across the world had to embark on extraordinary measures in order to stabilize the economy from an extraordinary shock. We took steps to increase the flow of credit to critical sectors of the economy, in order to enable faster recovery of the economy.  “We also sought to prevent the economic crisis from spilling into a major financial crisis by taking the following actions; i. A 1-year extension of a moratorium on principal repayments for CBN intervention facilities; ii. Strengthening of the Loan to Deposit ratio policy, which has resulted in a significant rise in loans provided by financial institutions to banking customers.  Loans given to the private sector, have risen by over 21 per cent over the past year. iii. Creation of NGN 50 billion target credit facility for affected households and small and medium enterprises through the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank; iv. Creation of a N100 billion intervention fund in loans to pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners intending to expand and strengthen the capacity of our healthcare institutions; v. Creation of a research fund, which is designed to support the development of vaccines in Nigeria. vi. A N1 trillion facility in loans to boost local manufacturing and production across critical sectors.  “ Regulatory Forbearance was granted to banks to restructure loans given to sectors that were severally affected by the pandemic viii. Mobilization of key stakeholders in the Nigerian economy, which led to the provision of over N23bn in relief materials to affected households, and the setup of 39 isolation centres across the country. The effect of these measures which included the provision of palliatives to individuals affected by the pandemic, increase in access to credit to critical sectors of the economy that are either high employers of labour or have the ability to create jobs at a fast pace, helped to contain a significant decline in GDP growth in the 2nd quarter of the year.  “Analysts expected GDP growth to decline by 7.4 per cent but the impact of the measures by the monetary and fiscal authorities helped to reduce this decline to 6.1 per cent. This decline was less severe than the decline experienced in other economies such as the United States, South Africa, and India which saw significant declines in growth by 32 per cent, 52 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.  “We do expect that with the phase-out of the lockdown measures, GDP growth in the 3rd quarter will be much better than that of the 2nd quarter, due to the impact of the measures being implemented by the Monetary and Fiscal Authorities.  “The CBN also feels compelled to let Nigerians know that in spite of the cordial and open relations between both organisations, the NESG could have raised its allegations directly with us but never did. Instead they chose to release a Press Statement, having leaked its content to a leading Business Newspaper in the country.  “Let us now turn to the specifics of their diatribe. On the CBN’s development finance activities, we are comforted by the NESG’s reluctant admission that many Central Banks around the world are also engaging in similar actions. The CBN engaged in development finance in order to address the credit needs of the sectors critical to improving livelihoods, reducing poverty, and promoting inclusive growth.  “These goals have become doubly important in light of the significant shocks to the economy following the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In pursuit of transparency, the CBN usually publishes disbursements made under these activities in our Economic Reports.  “Although the bourgeoises atop the NESG may not feel the impact of the Bank’s development finance activities, many ordinary Nigerians, including smallholder farmers, households, and medium-scale entrepreneurs across the country know better.  “As encapsulated in our most recent monthly economic report published on the Bank’s website, a total of N38.11 billion was disbursed as loans to 44,458 beneficiaries through the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank (NMFB). This number has risen to N59.12 billion; supporting to 103,189 beneficiaries as of August 2020. It is important for the NESG to note that our intervention programmes in the agricultural sector were a key contributor to the resilience of the agricultural sector during the crisis, as the sector experienced positive growth of 1.6 percent in the second quarter of the year despite the lockdown.  “As the NESG may be aware, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, and Thailand placed export restrictions on the exports of critical food items, including rice and eggs.  “With these disruptions, the Nigerian economy could have faced a major food crisis, but for the government’s intervention programmes in the agriculture sector. Furthermore, by alluding to the fact that money cannot address constraints in the agriculture sector, the NESG failed to realize that access to credit is listed among the three major challenges faced by farmers and businesses in Nigeria.  “While the Federal Government is seeking to address issues such as access to electricity and logistic constraints faced by businesses, it was vital for the CBN to address an area that we had sufficient ability to impact upon, given the nature of the crisis we faced, which is improving the flow of credit to critical sectors of the economy.  “Contrary to the NESG’s allegation that our lending process is devoid of a proper framework, it is important to note that recipients of intervention funds from CBN go through an expansive due diligence process through participating financial institutions (PFI), following which an additional assessment process is embarked upon by the CBN before disbursements are provided. The PFIs expend extensive due diligence on these intervention loans as the risk of default lies with them.  “On the revisions to the BOFIA Act, there are many reasons why we see a total ignorance or malicious intent on the part of the NESG. First, the provision they refer to as being currently conceived as part of the new BOFIA already exists as Section 53 in the old Act, which is now Section 51 in the amended Act passed by the National Assembly.  “The current bill has not proposed any changes to that section at all. Second, contrary to their misleading anxiety and associated reportage, the provision of Section 51 does not purport to confer immunity on the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria like that which obtains for State Governors.  “Rather, this provision protects the Federal Government, the Central Bank of Nigeria and their respective officials against adverse claims for actions or omission in good faith exercise of powers under BOFIA and other specified statutes including the Central Bank of Nigeria Act and regulations made thereunder.  “The import of the said provision is to set a threshold against which suits against public officers must be filtered, such that for a suit to be maintainable it must scale that threshold by proving bad faith on the part of the pubic officer. It is not a bar against action. Indeed, a review of the legislative history of BOFIA will readily show that the said provision also appeared as Section 49(1) of the then BOFIA of 1991.  “Further digging also readily show that the same law is employed in other legislations including the extant: a. Central Bank of Nigeria Act 2007 (Section 52), b. the NDIC Act 2006 (Section 55) and c. the Investments and Securities Act 2007(Section 302) A similar provision is in the AMCON (Amendment) Act 2020, as it had been noticed that debtors and the like simply rush to court, obtain injunctions and stop the orderly resolution of cases and proper implementation of the law.  ALSO READ:  “The false alarm raised by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group raises serious credibility questions on the actions of the group, as its comments, which have been circulated across the globe, significantly harmed the credibility of the Governor and the CBN as an institution. On border closure, we are disappointed that the NESG has not shown any tendency to deeply interrogate the real reasons for the closure.  “While the CBN is not opposed to its reopening, we must never forget the real reason why that border was shut in the first place: significant economic sabotage involving smuggling of many fake products, drugs, small arms, and other goods.  “How can a Nigerian farmer struggle for months to plant, cater, and harvest their crops only to find that those crops cannot attract good prices because of smuggled products from across our borders? Does the NESG know that according to the International Trade Center, Benin Republic imports as much as rice as China and nearly as much frozen chicken as the UK.?  “In which country does the NESG think all these rice and chicken end up? How then can a Nigerian rice farmer or poultry owner survive? While the Federal Government is doing its best to tackle these issues and reopen the border, we must bear in mind that border issues require cooperation by other countries. But if these countries, given their huge benefits from a rigged system, deny there is even a problem, how can Nigeria reopen the border without resolving these matters?  “With respect to foreign exchange, the CBN operates two windows: wholesale and retail. In the wholesale window, banks are allocated FOREX weekly, which is meant to be allocated to their customers at their discretion, reflecting customer size and distributive efficiency, for final sale to parents paying school fees, patients settling medical bills abroad, SME traders importing small-scale inputs and raw materials, and general travellers for business and personal trips.  “The CBN also allocates a certain amount of FX to licensed BDCs per week, who resell to small-scale users. In both categories, the CBN does not know the final buyers of this FX. In the retail window, banks submit a detailed list of applicants who are then allocated foreign exchange based on availability.  “Given that these submissions are first scrutinized by the banks and are accompanied by the provision of significant documentation, we do not understand the extra transparency being called for by the NESG. Based on very limited information and cross-country exposure, the NESG refers to the CBN’s recent directive, which simply sets a floor on saving rates as “price-fixing”.  “Given that in an ideal economic textbook/theory, saving should be equal to the investment, we expected total deposits should closely mirror total loans. Yet, over the past several months, we have noticed an increasingly large gap between total deposits in the banking system and total credit to the economy. While total deposits stood at about N25 trillion in January 2020, total loans stood at N17 trillion.  “As of August 2020, while total deposits have increased to N29.7 trillion, total loans were only N19 trillion. Many rich cooperates have simply been content with saving their cash balances and collecting huge interest payments, rather than expanding their investment, which should lead to hiring more people and producing more goods. In other to forestall a continuation of this trend, the CBN had to act to discourage these practices for the good of the economy.  “In other words, the rationale for moving to reduce the saving rates by banks is actually to encourage more lending.

It faulted the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) for criticizing its policies, without engaging with the organization.  A statement by its Director of Corporate Communications, Mr. Isaac Okoroafor, last night read in full, “The attention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has been drawn to a recent press release titled ‘Matters of Urgent Attention’ by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), which calls into question some of the measures taken by the CBN to support the stability of our financial system and enable faster recovery of our economy, following the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Nigeria.  “As we all are aware, the impact of COVID-19 on countries across the world resulted in a significant downturn in the global economy. Consequently, countries including Nigeria were forced to impose lockdown measures in order to contain the spread of the pandemic. This action resulted in depressed economic activity in the first half of the year.  “Except for China and Vietnam, advanced, emerging and frontier market economies, all experienced significant negative growth in the first half of 2020, and some are currently in a recession. In response to these unfortunate events across the globe, central banks have embarked on measures aimed at stabilizing their respective economies by reducing lending rates, which declined to negative territory in several advanced economies, in addition to increasing the scale of their asset purchase programmes.  “Indeed, after reducing its Federal Funds rate to 0 percent, the US Federal Reserve Bank implemented a huge securities purchase programme, which included purchase of corporate bonds (including those below investment grades). The Reserve Bank also provided credit facilities to non-bank institutions which included, money market funds and corporations.  “The balance sheet of the US Federal Reserve in support of these activities increased by over $3 trillion, while the European Central Bank expanded its balance sheet by over $1 trillion. Furthermore, the Bank of England in an unusual move gave an open check to the UK Government in order to fund its recovery efforts. It is therefore pertinent to state that the Nigerian economy is not immune from these crises given the over 65 percent drop in commodity prices; disruptions in global supply chains and the unprecedented outflow of over $100bn of debt and equity funds from emerging markets between March and May 2020; in addition to the impact of the lockdown on economic activities.  READ ALSO:  “These activities resulted in an over 60 percent reduction in revenues due to the Federation Account, a significant drop in foreign currency inflows, which led to downward adjustments in the naira/dollar exchange rate and a rise in inflation due to the exchange rate pass through effect of imported inflation. The Central Bank of Nigeria like other Central Banks across the world had to embark on extraordinary measures in order to stabilize the economy from an extraordinary shock. We took steps to increase the flow of credit to critical sectors of the economy, in order to enable faster recovery of the economy.  “We also sought to prevent the economic crisis from spilling into a major financial crisis by taking the following actions; i. A 1-year extension of a moratorium on principal repayments for CBN intervention facilities; ii. Strengthening of the Loan to Deposit ratio policy, which has resulted in a significant rise in loans provided by financial institutions to banking customers. Loans given to the private sector, have risen by over 21 percent over the past year. iii. Creation of NGN 50 billion target credit facility for affected households and small and medium enterprises through the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank; iv. Creation of a NGN100 billion intervention fund in loans to pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners intending to expand and strengthen the capacity of our healthcare institutions; v. Creation of a research fund, which is designed to support the development of vaccines in Nigeria. vi. A N1 trillion facility in loans to boost local manufacturing and production across critical sectors.  “ Regulatory Forbearance was granted to banks to restructure loans given to sectors that were severally affected by the pandemic viii. Mobilization of key stakeholders in the Nigerian economy, which led to the provision of over N23bn in relief materials to affected households, and the setup of 39 isolation centers across the country.  The effect of these measures which included provision of palliatives to individuals affected by the pandemic, increase in access to credit to critical sectors of the economy that are either high employers of labor or have the ability to create jobs at a fast pace, helped to contain a significant decline in GDP growth in the 2nd quarter of the year.”  “Analysts expected GDP growth to decline by 7.4 percent but the impact of the measures by the monetary and fiscal authorities helped to reduce this decline to 6.1 percent. This decline was less severe than the decline experienced in other economies such as the United States, South Africa, and India which saw significant declines in growth by 32 percent, 52 percent and 23 percent respectively.  “We do expect that with the phase out of the lockdown measures, GDP growth in the 3rd quarter will be much better than that of the 2nd quarter, due to the impact of the measures being implemented by the Monetary and Fiscal Authorities.  “The CBN also feels compelled to let Nigerians know that in spite of the cordial and open relations between both organizations, the NESG could have raised its allegations directly with us but never did. Instead they chose to release a Press Statement, having leaked its content to a leading Business Newspaper in the country.  “Let us now turn to the specifics of their diatribe. On the CBN’s development finance activities, we are comforted by the NESG’s reluctant admission that many Central Banks around the world are also engaging in similar actions. The CBN engaged in development finance in order to address the credit needs of the sectors critical to improving livelihoods, reducing poverty, and promoting inclusive growth.  “These goals have become doubly important in light of the significant shocks to the economy following the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In pursuit of transparency, the CBN usually publishes disbursements made under these activities in our Economic Reports.  “Although the bourgeoises atop the NESG may not feel the impact of the Bank’s development finance activities, many ordinary Nigerians, including smallholder farmers, households, and medium-scale entrepreneurs across the country know better.  “ As encapsulated in our most recent monthly economic report published on the Bank’s website, a total of N38.11 billion was disbursed as loans to 44,458 beneficiaries through the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank (NMFB). This number has risen to N59.12 billion; supporting to 103,189 beneficiaries as of August 2020. It is important for the NESG to note that our intervention programmes in the agricultural sector were a key contributor to the resilience of the agricultural sector during the crisis, as the sector experienced positive growth of 1.6 percent in the second quarter of the year despite the lockdown.  “As the NESG may be aware, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, and Thailand placed export restrictions on the exports of critical food items, including rice and eggs.  “With these disruptions, the Nigerian economy could have faced a major food crisis, but for the government’s intervention programmes in the agriculture sector. Furthermore, by alluding to the fact that money cannot address constraints in the agriculture sector, the NESG failed to realize that access to credit is listed among the three major challenges faced by farmers and businesses in Nigeria.  “While the Federal Government is seeking to address issues such as access to electricity and logistic constraints faced by businesses, it was vital for the CBN to address an area that we had sufficient ability to impact upon, given the nature of the crisis we faced, which is improving the flow of credit to critical sectors of the economy.  “Contrary to the NESG’s allegation that our lending process is devoid of a proper framework, it is important to note that recipients of intervention funds from CBN go through an expansive due diligence process through participating financial institutions (PFI), following which an additional assessment process is embarked upon by the CBN before disbursements are provided. The PFIs expend extensive due diligence on these intervention loans as the risk of default lies with them.  “On the revisions to the BOFIA Act, there are many reasons why we see a total ignorance or malicious intent on the part of the NESG. First, the provision they refer to as being currently conceived as part of the new BOFIA already exists as Section 53 in the old Act, which is now Section 51 in the amended Act passed by the National Assembly.  “The current bill has not proposed any changes to that section at all. Second, contrary to their misleading anxiety and associated reportage, the provision of Section 51 does not purport to confer immunity on the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria like that which obtains for State Governors.  “ Rather, this provision protects the Federal Government, the Central Bank of Nigeria and their respective officials against adverse claims for actions or omission in good faith exercise of powers under BOFIA and other specified statutes including the Central Bank of Nigeria Act and regulations made thereunder.  “The import of the said provision is to set a threshold against which suits against public officers must be filtered, such that for a suit to be maintainable it must scale that threshold by proving bad faith on the part of the pubic officer. It is not a bar against action. Indeed, a review of the legislative history of BOFIA will readily show that the said provision also appeared as Section 49(1) of the then BOFIA of 1991.  “Further digging also readily show that the same law is employed in other legislations including the extant: a. Central Bank of Nigeria Act 2007 (Section 52), b. the NDIC Act 2006 (Section 55) and c. the Investments and Securities Act 2007(Section 302) A similar provision is in the AMCON (Amendment) Act 2020, as it had been noticed that debtors and the like simply rush to court, obtain injunctions and stop orderly resolution of cases and proper implementation of the law.  “The false alarm raised by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group raises serious credibility questions on the actions of the group, as its comments, which have been circulated across the globe, significantly harmed the credibility of the Governor and the CBN as an institution. On border closure, we are disappointed that the NESG has not shown any tendency to deeply interrogate the real reasons for the closure.  “While the CBN is not opposed to its reopening, we must never forget the real reason why that border was shut in the first place: significant economic sabotage involving smuggling of many fake products, drugs, small arms, and other goods.  “How can a Nigerian farmer struggle for months to plant, cater, and harvest their crops only to find that those crops cannot attract good prices because of smuggled products from across our borders? Does the NESG know that according to the International trade Center, Benin Republic imports as much as rice as China and nearly as much frozen chicken as the U.K.?  “ In which country does the NESG think all these rice and chicken end up? How then can a Nigerian rice farmer or poultry owner survive? While the Federal Government is doing its best to tackle these issues and reopen the border, we must bear in mind that border issues require cooperation by other countries. But if these countries, given their huge benefits from a rigged system, deny there is even a problem, how can Nigeria reopen the border without resolving these matters? With respect to foreign exchange, the CBN operates two windows: wholesale and retail. In the wholesale window, banks are allocated FOREX weekly, which is meant to be allocated to their customers at their discretion, reflecting customer size and distributive efficiency, for final sale to parents paying school fees, patients settling medical bills abroad, SME traders importing small-scale inputs and raw materials, and general travelers for business and personal trips. “The CBN also allocates a certain amount of FX to licensed BDCs per week, who resell to small-scale users. In both categories, the CBN does not know the final buyers of this FX. In the retail window, banks submit a detailed list of applicants who are then allocated foreign exchange based on availability.  “Given that these submissions are first scrutinized by the banks and are accompanied by the provision of significant documentation, we do not understand the extra transparency being called for by the NESG. Based on very limited information and cross-country exposure, the NESG refers to the CBN’s recent directive, which simply sets a floor on saving rates as “price fixing”.  “Given that in an ideal economic textbook/theory, saving should be equal to investment, we expected total deposits should closely mirror total loans. Yet, over the past several months, we have noticed an increasingly large gap between total deposits in the banking system and total credit to the economy. While total deposits stood at about N25 trillion in January 2020, total loans stood at N17 trillion.  “As of August 2020, while total deposits have increased to N29.7 trillion, total loans were only N19 trillion. Many rich cooperates have simply been content with saving their cash balances and collecting huge interest payments, rather than expanding their investment, which should lead to hiring more people and producing more goods. In other to forestall a continuation of this trend, the CBN had to act to discourage these practices for the good of the economy.  “In other words, the rationale for moving to reduce the saving rates by banks is actually to encourage more lending. We also need to note in light of COVID-19 and to encourage more investments, many Central Banks have cut their saving rates to nearly zero.  “In fact, some Central Banks, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, Denmark’s Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, are now operating “negative interest rates”, which means customers pay banks to keep their deposits.  “Although the NESG, under its current leadership, has fallen short of its own standards and become a shadow of its old self, we believe there are better ways to resuscitate the Group’s brand other than through cheap popularity and tarnished attention using ambushed press statements made up of contrived allegations.

Russia, Japan, Australia, South Korea and India are among those remotely joining an event hosted by Vietnam that will include a 27-nation security forum, as concern grows about rhetoric and accidental conflict, and about other countries being caught up in the fray.  ""The regional geopolitical and geoeconomic landscape, including the South China Sea, are witnessing growing volatilities that are detrimental to peace and stability,"" Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in his opening speech at the summit.  The role of law and multilateral institutions were being ""greatly challenged"", Pham Binh Minh, Vietnam's foreign minister, said in his opening remarks.  Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi cautioned the United States and China against entangling South East Asian nations in their geopolitical battle.  ""We don't want to get trapped by this rivalry,"" Retno told Reuters ahead of the ASEAN Regional Forum, which will convene on Sept. 12.  Retno said ASEAN did not want to take sides, while also describing the increased militarisation in the South China Sea as ""worrying"".  The United States has spoken out strongly against China over trade, technology and its maritime conduct, and President Donald Trump has trumpeted his tough approach to China in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election.  Washington has accused Beijing of bullying its neighbours by sending ships close to their offshore energy operations, and of opportunism in holding military exercises and testing new defence hardware in disputed locations, while rival claimants battle coronavirus outbreaks. China said its actions were lawful.  Since mid-August, the United States has repeatedly riled China by sending warships to the South China Sea and the sensitive Taiwan Strait and flew a reconnaissance plane over Chinese live-fire drills.  It blacklisted 24 Chinese entities over their involvement in building and militarising artificial islands.  ""There's no desire to take sides - or to be seen to be doing so,"" said Collin Koh, a security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of Studies.  ASEAN would instead discuss with China the advancement of a long-delayed code of maritime conduct, and the development and access to a COVID-19 vaccine, he said.  The group's talks with the United States would urge military restraint and greater investments from corporate America, he said. Both would seek to ""de-focus on the intensifying rivalry"".  The 10 ASEAN members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Russia, Japan, Australia, South Korea and India are among those remotely joining an event hosted by Vietnam that will include a 27-nation security forum, as concern grows about rhetoric and accidental conflict, and about other countries being caught up in the fray.  “The regional geopolitical and geoeconomic landscape, including the South China Sea, are witnessing growing volatilities that are detrimental to peace and stability,” Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in his opening speech at the summit.  The role of international law and multilateral institutions were being “greatly challenged”, Pham Binh Minh, Vietnam’s foreign minister, said in his opening remarks.  US-China rivalry  Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi cautioned the United States and China against entangling South-East Asian nations in their geopolitical battle.  “We don’t want to get trapped by this rivalry,” Retno told Reuters ahead of the ASEAN Regional Forum, which will convene on September 12.  Retno said ASEAN did not want to take sides, while also describing the increased militarisation in the South China Sea as “worrying”.  The United States has spoken out strongly against China over trade, technology and its maritime conduct, and President Donald Trump has trumpeted his tough approach to China in the run-up to the US presidential election.  Washington has accused Beijing of bullying its neighbours by sending ships close to their offshore energy operations, and of opportunism in holding military exercises and testing new defence hardware in disputed locations, while rival claimants battle coronavirus outbreaks. China said its actions were lawful.  Since mid-August, the United States has repeatedly riled China by sending warships to the South China Sea and the sensitive Taiwan Strait and flew a reconnaissance plane over Chinese live-fire drills.  It blacklisted 24 Chinese entities over their involvement in building and militarising artificial islands.  “There’s no desire to take sides — or to be seen to be doing so,” said Collin Koh, a security expert at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.  ASEAN would instead discuss with China the advancement of a long-delayed code of maritime conduct, and the development and access to a Covid-19 vaccine, he said.  The group’s talks with the United States would urge military restraint and greater investments from corporate America, he said. Both would seek to “de-focus on the intensifying rivalry”.  The 10 ASEAN members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam."

It has managed to contain the spread of COVID-19 infections, clocking up 100 days without any confirmed local transmissions of the virus. But this success has come at a high economic cost, one that threatens to disrupt the country’s relations with major outside powers. Moreover, the recent discovery of an anomalous COVID-19 case has resulted in further delays to the country’s reopening.  There have been a plethora of articles and analyses questioning whether the ongoing closure of Thailand’s borders to the majority of foreign visitors is going to create more economic troubles than a partial opening. The latter option has been implemented in parts of Europe, but has been followed in some cases by a fresh wave of infections. The border closure is particularly detrimental for a country like Thailand, where tourism contributes anywhere between 10 and 20 percent of gross domestic product annually.  While it is too early to draw conclusions, more than 4 million Thais are currently unemployed and as many as 14 million people are expected to be out of jobs if drastic action is not taken before the end of the year. Connected to this economic hardship is the rising wave of public protests calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha and the drafting of a new constitution, among other sensitive and controversial requests.  How does all of this play into the Kingdom’s future relations with the major powers? Thailand is commonly known for its accommodating foreign policy, in which it has balanced adroitly between outside powers and sought good relations with each, in spite of political differences. But in the post-COVID-19 climate of growing superpower rivalry and tension, the country’s decisions should be pondered even more carefully. Upcoming events – such as the U.S. presidential elections in November – will require Thai leaders and policymakers to review or renew their bilateral relations with several major powers.  Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter  The European Union might not be the first international actor that comes to mind when one thinks of Thailand, but it nonetheless has close and diverse ties with the country. Beyond reopening talks into a possible free trade agreement, development assistance, and collaborations on environmental and social policy, the EU contributed more than 11 percent of Thailand’s tourists before the pandemic, according to statistics.

Still unwilling to open the country to mass tourism, Thai authorities have recently advanced a plan to attract European retirees to the country. Although some reports have highlighted that Thailand might not be as welcoming and affordable as it once was, a well-executed plan is likely to attract seniors eager to settle down in a tropical country that has so far managed to limit the spread of COVID-19. The move would be much welcomed by newcomers, as well as by retirees who have been unable to return because of the current restrictions. More broadly, it would help strengthen relations between Bangkok and Brussels.  In Japan, a country boasting a long and fruitful history of relations with Thailand, Prime Minister Abe Shinzo has just announced his resignation due to lingering health issues. Japan-Thai relations have been stable for decades, involving mutually advantageous economic and sociocultural exchanges. This is exemplified by the number of Japanese factories scattered across the country as much as by the Thai people’s widespread admiration for everything Japan, from its food and fashion to its music and anime films. It is unlikely that Abe’s successor will have a negative impact on bilateral relations and existing sociocultural interactions, but Japan might still be caught between the Sino-American rivalry which could put pressure on the country and its leaders to take a more definite stance, one that Thailand will seek to avoid.  While Japan’s elections are not expected until late 2021, the U.S. presidential election is fast approaching on November 3. Several Asian countries have lamented Trump’s “America First” doctrine, which has alienated allies and partners, and instilled widespread uncertainty about Washington’s commitment to the region. These concerns were further exacerbated by China’s growing assertiveness, most notably in the South China Sea, but also in Hong Kong, or in its increasingly confrontational stance towards Taiwan.  Advertisement  In spite of reassuring words from the American ambassador to Thailand, the re-election of Trump would mean four more years of uncertainty for the Kingdom and its Southeast Asian neighbors. Meanwhile the competing candidate, Joe Biden, is likely to revert to a more robust version of the Obama administration’s “rebalance” to Asia policy. Observers have already emphasized the need of a new American president to “win back Southeast Asia,” and Thailand, as a formal treaty ally, might be willing to reconfirm old bonds should the need arise.  Last but not least, Thailand’s handling of China can arguably be seen as the country’s most delicate bilateral relationship, due to its paramount economic and political importance to the region. The two countries share entwined histories of economic and cultural exchange, which have been marked by multiple waves of immigration from southern China. This has resulted in a sizable presence and influence of ethnic Chinese at the upper echelons of Thai politics and business.  More recently, China has become the number one source of tourist arrivals to Thailand, contributing as much as 40 percent of arrivals in the past few years. Although this relatively sudden influx has created some issues, including the rise of exploitative “zero-dollar tours” targeting Chinese visitors, Thailand has in general managed to adapt to the sudden spike in arrivals from the Chinese mainland. However, there were growing concerns about this apparent overreliance even before the pandemic hit, a question which is now likely to become even more pressing.  Beyond tourism, China’s footprint across Thailand can also be seen through the increasing number of infrastructure developments, many grouped under Beijing’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) connectivity scheme. Among the welter of bridges, dams, and highway, the flagship BRI project in mainland Southeast Asia is arguably the high-speed railway that aims to connect the city of Kunming in southern China to Singapore, via Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia.  The rail project has been marked by repeated delays, but the first stretch running from the Chinese border to Vientiane, the capital of Laos, is scheduled to begin operations in 2021. Nearly crossing the full north-to-south length of Thailand, the project has been divided into multiple sections which will open at different stages.  The implications of this major railway artery have been discussed extensively in recent times, especially following the introduction of the BRI, and it is hard to deny the profound economic and even geopolitical impact that it would have on mainland Southeast Asia. The risks of taking on too much Chinese debt, and the granting of track-side concessions to China, are often debated, but Thailand is in a relatively good position to dictate the terms of its engagement with BRI, at least when compared to poorer neighbors such as Laos, Cambodia, or Myanmar.  All considered, Thailand cannot risk foregoing nor downplaying any of its existing relations with major global powers, and it will have to perform a careful “dance” among them in the period that follows the waning and aftermath of COVID-19. In the uncertain months and years to come, Thailand will have to reassure its powerful partners that it is still a welcoming country for tourists and retirees, as well as for foreign investors.

Such a multipronged approach would entail developing and implementing Thailand’s advertised “Safe and Sealed” strategy for tourism, reopening the borders to at least selected investors and businesspeople, and being one of the first countries to engage the soon-to-be-elected successor to Abe. It would also require the Thai government to avoid upsetting either the U.S. or China, while maintaining a judicious balance of economic and strategic ties with both. And all of this would have to be done while facing growing domestic pressure to address unemployment, and rising calls for far-reaching political reforms. After all, a country in turmoil is not appealing to either tourists or investors.  Ultimately, Thailand has already shown that it has the ability to benefit both from competition and cooperation among major powers. The Kingdom is accommodating but proud, and will not easily bend to any outside power’s will, especially when it is perceived as overbearing and patronizing. Owing to its strategic geographical position and role within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Thailand is in a relatively favorable position in the midst of intensifying global disputes. But finding a balance between domestic and external challenges might require changes and decisions that the country may not be ready to make – at least not yet.

But since 2015, it has ramped up recruitment of scientists, and investment in the field as part of its strategy to modernize its military. Now, the coronavirus pandemic is showcasing the PLA's growing expertise in medical research, including a major role in developing the coronavirus vaccine that was the first in the world to be approved for restricted use.  “China is definitely trying to leverage the crisis from a PR perspective,” says Abigail Coplin, who studies China’s biotechnology industry at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York.  Medical researcher Major General Chen Wei at the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology — part of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences — led the team that developed the vaccine, which included collaborators from government agencies, universities and the Tianjin-based pharmaceutical company CanSino Biologics.  In July, the team became one of the first in the world to publish results in a peer-reviewed journal that showed a coronavirus vaccine to be safe and capable of eliciting an immune response1. By then, the Chinese government had already approved the vaccine, based on a common cold adenovirus and called Ad5-nCoV, for limited use in military personnel, before large-scale testing to prove its efficacy. Wei and members of her team were among the first — of thousands in the military so far — to receive the vaccine. Chen and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology did not respond to Nature’s request for comment about the vaccine work.  Should the vaccine win approval for more widespread use before efforts backed by other countries, especially the United States, “it will be a pretty big propaganda victory” for Beijing, says Adam Ni, a China analyst from the Australian National University in Canberra who studies the PLA.  As well as its contributions to the development of a coronavirus vaccine, the PLA has also taken a high-profile role in controlling the pandemic in China, sent assistance with pandemic response in a host of countries and used the vaccine to forge new links with countries.  Other militaries, including the United States, work on vaccines and conduct medical research. But the sheer size of the PLA and the speed at which reforms are taking place make its scientific transformation noteworthy, and for some, a cause for concern, especially given the growing political tensions between the United States and China, he says.  In the past few months, US security officials revealed that China has tried to spy on and steal information from US pharmaceutical companies and university research groups working on coronavirus vaccines. Scientists have also raised concerns about the ethics of approving a vaccine that is still being trialled for use in the military.  Science a priority  In 2015, China’s President Xi Jinping announced reforms that made science and innovation a key element of modernizing its armed forces, says Elsa Kania, who analyses Chinese military strategy at the Center for a New American Security in Washington DC.  The PLA established electronic-, cyber- and space-warfare branches alongside its more conventional army, navy and air force. And in 2016, a Science and Technology Commission, which decides what research is funded, became one of 15 newly formed military 'sections'.  “It’s gone from a fairly backward military in the 70s and 80s — large but certainly not professional and not technologically advanced — to a much more formidable military,” says Ni.  The reforms also brought the Academy of Military Medical Sciences — which led development of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine — under the umbrella of the Academy of Military Sciences, the PLA’s main military strategy institution, which oversees nine other research institutions.  Civilian recruits  Before the reforms, the PLA recruited scientists either internally or from military universities, partly because civilian scientists didn’t find research positions in the military attractive, says Ni. Uniformed members of the military must fulfil fitness obligations, and working conditions were less flexible than in civilian institutions.  But since 2018, the PLA has been recruiting more civilian-trained scientists,making research positions more appealing — and, in particular, has upped its recruitment of medical scientists.  The Academy of Military Medical Sciences has recruited 213 civilians for scientific research positions since 2018, making it the second-highest recruiter of scientific talent in the Academy of Military Science’s 10 research institutions, according to an analysis posted online by Kai Lin Tay at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. The Academy of Military Sciences “now relies more on civilians than military cadres to fulfil its scientific research needs,” writes Tay.  The military is also increasing its ties to civilian universities in China, as part of a policy known as military–civil fusion, which the Chinese government also announced in 2015. Graduate students affiliated with the PLA and a civilian university are becoming more common. The military–civil fusion strategy highlights biology as a priority research area. The PLA has also been bolstering its scientific expertise by sending researchers abroad.  And partnerships between the PLA and the medical-science companies have accelerated since the start of the pandemic, according to Tay’s report. As well as collaborating with CanSino Biologics to develop the Ad5-nCoV vaccine, the PLA has partnered with Beijing Chieftain, which makes disinfecting and medical equipment, since March.  On show  The pandemic has provided China with an opportunity to highlight the military's scientific achievements on the domestic and international stage. For instance, PLA epidemiologists and medical workers have had an important role in treating the sick, monitoring the outbreak and overseeing distribution of medical supplies in Wuhan. The military has also assisted with the pandemic responses in Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia and Italy, by deploying units and supplies.  The PLA-developed vaccine could give China additional geopolitical influence with favoured countries being given priority access to the vaccine, says Ian McCaslin, a China military analyst affiliated with Air University’s China Aerospace Studies Institute in Washington DC. CanSino Biologics already has agreements to conduct phase III trials in Russia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.  The PLA’s renewed science focus is helping to advance existing military-research projects — in particular in brain science, says Kania. In 2018, PLA neuroscientists published a review outlining how military brain science could influence future wars, for example by using brain-computer interfaces to enhance soldiers' capabilities and by deploying psychological warfare against enemy nations2.  Limited insight  Because analysts who study the Chinese military have not traditionally focused on the medical research conducted by the PLA, its true impact remains unknown, says Kania. “We’re still trying to get a handle on how to understand the scope and scale of their activities as well as the quality and competitiveness of their research,” she says.  Some research is similar to that conducted by other military forces. The US military, for instance, is developing its own coronavirus vaccine and conducts basic research into trauma and infectious diseases.  And some of the PLA’s medical research is designed to maintain a healthy armed force, says McCaslin. “You have a medical need to take care of your soldiers during peacetime,” and to prepare for injuries that might occur during warfare, he says.  It's also important to bear in mind that the PLA’s scientific efforts represent only “a small minority of work being done in biotechnology, both within China and globally”, adds Coplin.  Cause for concern?  Still, some China experts and foreign governments are concerned about the participation of PLA researchers in medical research.  In July, the US Justice Department indicted two Chinese nationals for spying on three US-based entities involved in medical research to fight the coronavirus. The US biotech company Moderna, which is trialling one of the world's leading coronavirus vaccine candidates, later told Reuters that it was one of the companies that hackers had targeted. Chinese officials have denied any involvement.  “Tech transfer is clearly a policy and priority of the Chinese government at the highest levels and has involved fairly egregious instances of hacking, for purposes of data theft,” says Kania. “This pattern of behaviour is unique to China in the scale and scope as well as the severity of these incidents and the extent to which they contravene the norms of scientific and commercial engagement.”  Scientists are also concerned about China’s lack of safeguards to ensure that research on people is conducted ethically, says Kania. It is unclear whether military personnel were given a choice to have the PLA-backed coronavirus vaccine, she says. The researchers who worked on the vaccine did not respond to Nature’s request for comment on such ethics issues.  These are legitimate concerns, says Coplin, but she cautions the United States against using them as a reason to stymie otherwise productive collaborations with China."

Most of those doing the best have been island nations, which makes sense since air and boat arrivals are bottlenecks, and it’s easy to test incoming people. Land borders tend to be porous and it’s easier to spread.  Not all landlocked or bordered countries are doing poorly. Four Southeast Asian countries, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam are all doing well despite bordering countries in crisis. But (to me) the most notable exception has been Mongolia, landlocked between Russia and China. There are few more than 300 cases, 12 active, and zero deaths as of today.  Just because Mongolia has 8000km of border with the two neighbors doesn’t mean it’s easy to get in. Much of it is mountainous or through the Gobi Desert. Driving into Mongolia can be as dangerous as it is distant, so most travel in and out is either by rail or by plane. Mongolia cut rail travel to Russia and China in February and as of June still blocked most air travel in and out.  As said above, airports are bottlenecks and so are train stations, making detection and monitoring a lot easier. Starting in March, Mongolia began disinfecting trains every two hours and test passengers. With more than 8000 passengers per day of domestic travel, it’s a reasonable measure. They have also been disinfecting public spaces with sprays. Thus far, they report only one local transmission, from a French national to another person.  Two of the main reasons Mongolia’s government took immediate action are its inadequate medical system and population centres. A quarter of the population live in the capital, Ulan Bataar, which is also where most of the rail and air traffic pass through. Many live in Soviet-era apartment buildings, poverty and cardiovascular conditions are common, so COVID-19 could spread like wildfire if it got into the population.  Fortunately the Soviet era paid dividend with a high literacy rate (approx. 95%) and with most having cellphones (many have smartphones), the dissemination of accurate public health information was as effective as it was here in Taiwan. The Lancet has a good writeup on Mongolia’s success.  Technology Review: How Mongolia has kept the coronavirus at bay Davaadorj Rendoo, an epidemiologist at the National Center for Public Health in Ulaanbaatar, explains Mongolia’s national strategy. Mongolia shares the world’s longest land border with China, but its early and highly centralized pandemic response has been so effective that not a single person in the landlocked country has died from covid-19. A former army colonel turned public health official recounts how Mongolia enacted its extensive quarantine and testing regime under a state of emergency. We first heard about a new virus spreading in China around New Year’s Eve. On January 10, we issued our first public advisory, telling everyone in Mongolia to wear a mask. Here’s the thing: we don’t actually have a great public health system. That’s why our administrators were so afraid of covid-19. We don’t have many respirators, for example. We were really afraid that if we got community transmission even once, it would become a disaster for us. What was in everyone’s head was to be prepared before the spread. Another reason we were so keen to protect the community is because we have the world’s longest land border with China—2,880 miles [4,600 kilometers]—as well as continuous human flow for education and business from China to Mongolia. Mongolia is a big country with a sparse population, about 3.2 million people. Because our country has a very harsh, dry, and cold climate, every year from November to February we have an awful flu season, and the Ministry of Health always encourages people to practice good hygiene and wash hands, especially young children. So many of our suggestions were not new. [. . .] We also opened a dedicated, 24-hour covid hotline. People were getting all kinds of wrong information from social media. One big hoax was that because Mongolians eat very healthily and live in traditional nomadic lifestyles, we would not get the virus and had a “natural immunity.” Another big one was that because it is cold and dry, the virus does not survive here, and it only survives in warm and wet climates. Today, even the majority of herders and nomadic people have satellite TV with solar energy, so they can still access information. [. . .] We don’t know how long the state of emergency will last. Some of our highest officials have said we will close our borders indefinitely. We cannot take anything for granted. In Japan, they lifted restrictions and the virus came back. Until the end of this summer, we are not easing quarantine at all. But schools will have to start in September. What we still recommend every day to the public is to stay ready, because community transmission might be just around the corner.  Dr. Rendoo may not be very confident in his country’s ability to cope with the disease, but credit to them for not wasting time and doing everything right. Cheap prevention wasn’t hard.  The UN, in typical fashion, is more concerned about “the economy” and “debt”. If their concern were Mongolia’s (and other countries’) long term well being, they would be calling on creditor nations and the World Bank to forego servicing of debt. Instead, like most others, their focus seems to be on “reopening”. This is likely because, like Bolivia in South America, Mongolia has large quantities of mineral resources that other countries want. Mongolia has a flawed democracy, mostly free but heavily weighted toward one party, making corruption a problem, both internal and external. They had national elections in June 2020."

Kaavan has never known life outside captivity. The 35-year-old elephant has been stuck in Pakistan’s Marghazar Zoo in Islamabad since 1985, with the world looking on in anguish as he mentally and physically declined. Fortunately, that zoo has now been ordered to close — and Kaavan is finally set for release.  His destination hasn’t been made public, though it’s likely he’ll be transferred to a more humane and communal zoo in Cambodia. According to Unilad, Kaavan has spent most of his life alone in a small enclosure — making this latest development all the more worthy of celebration.  Kaavan lost his lust for life when his partner died in 2012, likely in part due to Marghazar Zoo’s negligent conditions. When Islamabad’s High Court deemed the zoo inhumane and ordered its shutdown in May 2020, a medical examination required for Kaavan’s relocation revealed his haggard state.  According to The Guardian, Kavaan is malnourished, yet overweight. Years of walking on unfriendly flooring have cracked his nails, which were simply left unattended and allowed to grow. Most harrowing were his boredom and isolation which caused him to regularly shake his head — for hours.  Kavaan first arrived at Marghazar Zoo from Sri Lanka when he was one year old and was the only inmate at the time.  But the grassroots movement by activists around the world to release him has grown to remarkable heights since 2016, and even garnered the attention of celebrities like pop icon Cher. Fortunately, the tides have finally begun to turn for Kaavan, the “world’s loneliest elephant.”  Kaavan got his dispiriting monicker from supporters and animal rights groups such as Four Paws, which oversaw the transfer and examination of all of Marghazar Zoo’s animals. Tragically, that collaboration only revealed further how bleak the animal’s home had been all along.  “Unfortunately, the rescue comes too late for two lions that died during an attempted transfer at the end of July after local animal handlers set a fire in their enclosure to force them into transport crates,” said Martin Bauer, a spokesman for Four Paws.  Also according to Bauer, Kaavan’s recovery will be a long one — particularly since his wounds are more than physical.  “He’s also developed stereotypical behavior, which means he shakes his head back and forth for hours,” said Bauer. “This is mainly because he is simply bored.”  It appears as though everything isn’t lost quite yet for Kaavan. Together with wildlife veterinarians and experts, Four Paws conducted Kaavan’s medical examination and found him fit for travel.  “Following the checks, which confirmed Kaavan is strong enough, steps will now be taken to finalize his relocation to an animal sanctuary potentially in Cambodia,” said Bauer.  Head Veterinarian at Berlin’s Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research Dr. Frank Göritz shared his full support with the analysis. While he agreed that Kaavan’s isolation and boredom have led to troubling cognitive issues — the animal is physically capable of another chance.  “Overall, the results from his blood tests are good,” he said. “And his general health condition allows him to be relocated.”  This isn’t the first time the depressed state of a captive elephant captured the world’s attention. In 2019, Flavia, “the world’s saddest elephant,” died after 43 years alone in a Spanish zoo. Flavia had been forcibly removed from her herd of wild Indian elephants when she was just three and spent the remainder of her life in zoos deeply depressed. But Kaavan has a brighter future.  Ultimately, Kaavan’s story is both dispiriting and cathartic. Though he endured decades of neglect and loneliness, Kavaan has at least been given another chance at life.

It is the strength required to bring about social, economic, political, cultural and religious changes.  What is needed is a realisation that power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic. Power at its best is love implementing the demand of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love.  From these words of Martin Luther King Jr, it may not be wrong to conclude that there is nothing wrong with power when used constructively and not destructively.  For a man to function well in any given position of authority, he must identify that power is not a complete end but looks up to something further. It cannot itself be the ultimate goal.  Power is valuable according to the use to which it may be put. And most importantly, power, in the estimation of the Marxists, is but the ability to protect one’s interest.  With this fact highlighted, let’s focus on specific examples. Chief among such examples of destructive exercise of power includes Pol Pot.  It was in the news that while in power in Cambodia between 1975 and 1978, he used his position to cause the death of more than two million people in Cambodia – a small country in Southeast Asia bordered by Vietnam and Thailand. This is a verifiable fact.  The story is not different here in Africa. The late Robert Mugabe in his quest to hold on to power, massacred over 20,000 of his people and not animals; destroyed the nation’s economy and watched with disinterest while his wife looted millions of dollars.  Fresh in our memories are the Liberia episode in early 1990s, Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. Specifically in Africa, there are more accounts of gradual and silent encroachment/abuse of power by those in positions of authority, than by violent and sudden usurpations.  Talking about constructive use of power, the thought of Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime Minister of Singapore (as he then was), naturally comes to mind.  It is recorded that Lee grew 15 times independent Singapore with a GDP of $3billion in 1965 to $46billion in 1997, and its economy became the eighth highest per capita GNP in the world in 1997, according to a World Bank ranking.  We have a similar account in Nigeria. Shortly after independence, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, then Premier of the Western Region constructively used his position to better the chances of the people of his region – socioeconomically.  Through quality and affordable education, he set the region on a hyper-modern pathway. The Northern Region under the late Ahmadu Bello and the Eastern Region led by the late Chief Michael Okpara were not left behind in this race for infrastructural and socioeconomic developments of their regions.  ALSO READ: Residents occupy Rivers power plant over electricity outage  Among other infrastructural feats achieved within this space, Awolowo, to his credit, built Ikeja industrial estate, while Ahmadu Bello and Michael Okpara, had Kano and Aba industrial estates, respectively to their credits.  This feat or a combination of other people-purposed achievements without doubt, explains why over four decades after their reign, they are still remembered and used in virtually all the primary schools (both public and private), as examples of great leaders  Indeed, they defined power in the image of their actions. At the moment, such narrative has changed to the extent that in a period when policy makers across the globe are actively integrating frameworks that both protect the rights and opportunities of their citizens, the Federal Government has been reeling out inconsiderate policies/decisions that promote poverty and starvation.  Consequently, more people are joining the ranks of beggars such that their desperate struggle for bread renders them insensible to all feelings of decency and self-respect.  Let’s refresh our minds on these sad policies. From an increase of Value Added Tax, VAT, from five to 7.5 per cent, to re-introduction of Stamp Duty Charge, all in the bid to boost internally generated revenue in the midst of dwindling foreign earning from crude oil.  This year also witnessed the introduction of Stamp Duty on house rents and C of O transactions. As if these were not enough punishment for the masses, the Federal Government against all known logic and within a space of two weeks announced a hike in the price of petrol and the cost of electricity.  These flawed decisions and errors of judgement, in my opinion authenticate the position canvassed by Finkelstein, a Steven Roth Professor of management at the Tuck School of Business, United States of America, that leaders make bad decision because of inappropriate self-interest, distorting attachments and the presence of misleading memories.  If not presence of misleading memories, why has the All Progressive Congress, APC-led Federal Government suddenly failed to remember that it was a similar decision (deregulation/increase in pump price of petrol) that they condemned in 2011 during the Goodluck Ebele Jonathan administration?  If not inappropriate self-interest, why is it always comfortable for the present administration to scream market forces or forces of demand and supply when it comes to effecting hikes in the prices of essentials goods and services, like fuel and electricity that is beneficial to the common man on the street?  And if not distorting attachments, why increment in pump price of fuel at a time crude oil prices are nosediving in the global market and electricity tariff in a season when majority of Nigerians are without meters?  At a time the global community is concerned that COVID-19 has caused massive shocks to both the informal and formal economies and unearthed massive inequalities within our societies and in Africa?  At a time the World Bank estimates that Sub-Saharan Africa will see significant economic decline, and plunge to as low as -5.1 per cent this year? Can such decision be adjudged as right in a society that youth unemployment rate is currently, going by the National Bureau of Statistics, NBS, report, at 34.2 per cent? At a time when manufacturing companies are leaving the country in droves as a result of high cost of doing business?  Even as the global community watches with attention to the anemic use of power in the country, shouldn’t those who bought into the change mantra that brought us to this cross road blame themselves for their inability to demand clarification as to how the promised change and Next Levels will create positive impact on Nigerians?  Rather, within this period of vulnerability, Nigerians should take hope in the fact that a cross-road is a place of decision, difficult decisions.  There is a wise saying by James Tar Tsaaior that “if you do not know the direction you are headed, then, get to the crossroad and you will find the way to your destination.  Even the Christ had the last chance to make a definitive choice between drinking the cup in filial obedience and renouncing it. By drinking the cup to the dregs, he declared that it was finished; the sacrifice was consummated and human salvation became assured. It was a decision taken on a cross, a most difficult decision that has concretized the cross as an enduring symbol and sign for all ages.  Most importantly, as Nigerians wait at the cross road of nationhood, they must again draw strength from “the politics of remembrance and forgetfulness, it is sometimes convenient to forget. At others it is uncomfortable to remember. To forget is perhaps one of the greatest gifts of nature. But to remember can also be an invaluable asset sometimes”.  Likewise, it is my hope that come 2023, Nigerians will not forget the present crossroad. But even if as humans they forget, history will be there to remind them.

Owners David and Stephanie Boyd, 58 and 50, said their business is down by 90 per cent since reopening the Wetherill Park restaurant on September 1.  Thai Rock was closed on July 17 after one of their employees tested positive to the virus, and in the weeks that followed, the Thai Rock cluster grew to 104 cases, making it the biggest in Sydney.  Making matters worse, the couple's second restaurant in Potts Point in the inner east was linked to another six COVID-19 cases.  The Potts Point venue shut its doors on July 26 before reopening on September 3, and is also struggling to win back customers; making less than $200 a day, including online orders.  Stephanie Boyd (third from left) flanked by Thai Rock staff members, a COVID marshal in orange and a musician. Mrs Boyd and her partner David say their business could be forced to shut down in four weeks if low turnover continues  Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Boyd said: 'The two opening nights were reasonably good but then it just dropped.  'If these numbers continue, in four weeks of doing less than $200 a day, no business can survive that.  'You can only sustain it for so long when we're paying more out in wages than we're bringing in. We may have to make a tough call and close.'  When COVID struck, the 100-capacity Wetherill Park venue, distancing regulations cut the business to 51 seats, while the 200-capacity Potts Point restaurant dropped to just 61.  'Our maximum earning potential was already down more than half since we had to reduce seats because of of COVID,' David said.  'But now we're doing 10 per cent of what we were even during COVID. We're down 90 per cent.'  Overall, this represents a drop of roughly 95 per cent on pre-pandemic levels.  Stephanie and David Boyd, their 21-year-old daughter and one of their 23-year-old sons. The four of them work at the Thai Rock restaurants along with 14 staff members  Thai Rock's reopening night in Wetherill Park (pictured) was 'reasonably good' but since then, the turnover has dropped, according to Mr Boyd  Prior to the pandemic, both restaurants employed a total of 30 staff, but when table numbers dropped, this was cut to just 14.  Mr and Mrs Boyd and two of their three adult children also work at the restaurant.  If the restaurants were to close, it would leave their family and their 14 staff jobless.  Mr Boyd said the low level of turnover have been 'very tough' for their family-run business.  'This weekend was Father's Day, which is normally one of our busiest days but we were dead,' he said.  'Sunday's a nice day where you have a lot of people coming out - we did under $1,000, we didn't even stay until closing, we had to close early. Some of those days, only have enough to cover two or three staff.'  He said the Wetherill Park location is 'a little busier' than the Potts Point venue, which is only open in the evening.  The Potts Point venue only made $140 on Father's Day, which includes online orders from Uber Eats.  Empty seats can be seen behind Mr Boyd in a promotional picture for Father's Day. Mr Boyd said it is normally one of their busiest days of the year but on Sunday it was 'dead'  Mr and Mrs Boyd believe the bad publicity surrounding their six-week closure has 'significantly contributed' to low levels of business.  'Even to this day we see people holding their nose when they walk by as if they're going to catch something,' Mr Boyd said.  Mrs Boyd said she was 'devastated' by abusive online messages, including one that told her 'to go and die and to burn in hell', and she now sees a psychologist once a week.  'It was quite devastating, there were attacks directly at me personally, that I have allowed an infectious staff member to be working, that I was selfish and greedy, because I still have her employed,' she said.  'None of this is true, we did not know that she was infectious.'  The employee who sparked the outbreak worked five consecutive shifts in July before developing symptoms on July 14 and getting tested.  The restaurant was shut down on July 17 and all staff, including the Boyd family, went into self-isolation.  Mr and Mrs Boyd enjoy a dinner date. Mrs Boyd said she was 'devastated' by horrific messages, including one that told her 'to go and die and to burn in hell', and now sees a psychologist once a week  Mr and Mrs Boyd during a trip to Thailand. The couple have received torrents of online abuse since being linked to Sydney's biggest COVID-19 cluster  Ms Boyd, who fled the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia when she was just 10 years old, does not believe the online attacks were racially motivated.  'People have said that it is my grubby virus, that I should be put in jail, almost alluding that I have cooked it in the kitchen and served it,' she said.  'I've been called all sorts of names, that I'm an ex-sex worker. Recently there was a very dirty email, its just devastating to read that someone has that much hate and anger to someone they've never met.'  She also said there have been a number of fake reviews on Google that they have tried to get removed, but the tech giant refused.  Mr and Mrs Boyd have a daughter Chelsea, 21, and twin sons, 23, one of whom is named Dylan.  Daughter Chelsea (pictured), 21, also works at the restaurant. While in isolation, she was photographed in her bedroom by a photographer, which her mother says was an 'invasion of privacy'  Their children have helped 'shield' them from online abuse but have also received their fair share of flack.  'My son has been looked at like a walking virus, they look at him like he's dirty. It hurts when you see your son seen like that,' Mrs Boyd said.  'There were photos taken of my daughter in her bedroom. There was a photographer camped out of our house for two days, it's an invasion of privacy.'  During the restaurant closures, Ms Boyd said she hardly slept and constantly cried.  'I just thought there was no future because I had no restaurant to go to, I was very, very lost. I was thinking how could we recover financially when we've worked so hard to build this restaurant,' she said.  'Now, I've run out of tears. I just need to move on, I've dusted myself off. I've got two kids relying on me for income, staff members relying on me.'  Both restaurants have FLIR thermal cameras to check the temperature of everyone entering and use ozonated water, which is commonly used by dentists. Pictured: A screen grab from one of the cameras  Since reopening, the restaurant has gone 'above and beyond' with high-tech preventative measures to 'give customers another level of confidence'.  Both restaurants have thermal cameras to check the temperature of everyone entering and use ozonated water, which is commonly used by dentists.  They have also upgraded their alcohol-based sanitiser to Zoono, which provides 24 hours of proactive protection.  Zoono chemicals that last 30 days are also sprayed on tables every 28 days to ensure that the virus does not spread via contact, according to Mr Boyd.  They also have a microbiologist perform unannounced testing to ensure that everything is up to par.  'The cost is a lot, thousands of dollars. The chemicals themselves cost $200, which is five times as much as normal sanitiser,' he said.  'When customers see all the steps we're taking, they say ""you're actually one of the safest places to go to"".'  Mr Boyd said 'we need customers now more than ever' but 'people are frightened to go out, just in general'.  Son Dylan (pictured), 23, works at the restaurant's bar. Mrs Boyd said people have been looking at her son like he is 'a walking virus' since the cluster  A supportive message from a customer on an Uber Eats order.

'They all said the same thing, ""we're really sorry for what's happened to you"",' she said.  'They genuinely cared, they can see that we're in no way being blamed for it.'  Fairfield Mayor Frank Carbone, who oversees the Wetherill Park area, has called on locals to support Thai Rock and other businesses hit by the pandemic.  'Like many businesses, Thai Rock were simply unlucky to get caught up in the spread of COVID-19,' Mr Carbone said.  'It is important that we support our local businesses during COVID-19. When you go local first, you support local families and jobs.'  Mr Carbone said politicians have been using Thai Rock and his area 'as a stomping ground to promote themselves'.  'The fact is, our city has been the frontline when it comes to the virus,' he said.  'Our city has done a wonderful job when it comes to looking after the virus. It's not our fault that we were the frontline, but it is our fault that we fought hard.'"

Luckchai Kittipol… [+4182 chars]","Global demand for rubber gloves continues to surge during the pandemic.  The prospects for natural rubber prices are rising, boosted by a sharp uptick in demand for protective rubber gloves because of the pandemic and limited supply in the world market.  Luckchai Kittipol, honorary president of the Thai Rubber Association, said he is more upbeat about the rubber outlook after the prices of smoked rubber sheet grade 3 reached 60 baht per kilogramme for the first time on Sept 1 in more than a decade.  Prices rose from 58.25 baht per kg on Aug 31 and 40.99 baht early in the year.  In the past, Thailand's rubber production focused largely on rubber sheet, which is used as a raw material to make automotive tyres.  A recent surge in demand for protective rubber gloves, propelled by the Covid-19 pandemic, has driven rubber producers to shift their output to latex, which is used to make rubber gloves.  This year Thailand's latex production is expected to represent up to 30% of the overall rubber production compared with 20% last year, according to Mr Luckchai.  Thailand is the world's largest producer of natural rubber, making 4.8 million tonnes last year, with exports accounting for almost 4 million tonnes.  Thailand ranks fourth for exports of rubber products and processed rubber, trailing China, Germany and the US. Exports totalled US$11.2 billion last year, up 2%.  Key markets include the US, China, Japan, Asean and Australia, with automotive tyres accounting for 51% of the shipments, followed by synthetic rubber and rubber gloves at 19% and 11%, respectively.  The Commerce Ministry reported global demand for protective gloves is soaring in light of the coronavirus pandemic, driving Thailand's rubber glove exports to surge 38.5% year-on-year in the first seven months of 2020 to $959 million.  Key markets include the US, China, Japan and Britain.  In 2019, Thailand produced more than 20 billion rubber gloves, with exports making up 89% of total production.  Last year Thailand fetched $1.2 billion from rubber glove exports. The country was the third largest rubber glove exporter, trailing Malaysia and China.  According to Mr Luckchai, Thailand's natural rubber production is estimated to remain at 4.5 million tonnes this year, with exports accounting for 3.8-3.9 million tonnes.  Lower production is attributed largely to higher rainfall and a lack of labourers, most of whom are from Myanmar and Cambodia.  The price slump for natural rubber is another reason for the production dip, as it discouraged farmers to grow and tap trees.  Thai natural rubber prices have been falling since 2017, largely because of oversupply from major rubber producing countries.  The weak global economy subsequently cut demand from the auto industry, damaging rubber producers.  The drop was also attributed to the growth of rubber plantations in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV) in the past decade. CLMV now supplies 5.3% of the commodity to the global rubber market.  China, the world's biggest rubber consumer, has also increased its rubber imports from CLMV to feed its domestic demand.  The Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (ANRPC) predicted recently global production of natural rubber is likely to fall by 4.7% this year to 13.1 million tonnes as the pandemic has depressed demand and put the industry in crisis.  At the beginning of the year, the association forecast 3.8% and 2.7% rises in production and consumption, respectively. Now it sees demand falling by 6% to 12.9 million tonnes.  Natural rubber imports by China could fall by 5.1% from a year ago to 4.8 million tonnes, according to ANRPC, while demand from India -- the No.2 consumer and a major producer of rubber -- is set to plunge by 21.3% in part because of the lockdown of its car industry during the pandemic.  Mr Luckchai said domestic rubber consumption is expected to increase to 900,000 tonnes, up from 800,000 tonnes last year now that the Transport Ministry has decided to use natural rubber to produce barriers on roads nationwide.  He suggested the government promote the use of natural rubber in the country to sustain domestic prices and reduce over-reliance on exports, which comprise up to 80% now.  ""Many investors in China, Germany and Japan are interested in investing in Thailand, such as in the rubber gloves and tyre industries, but Covid-19 is a key stumbling block for their investment right now,"" Mr Luckchai said."

While the NESG alleged some of the policies by the government, through the CBN, have not yielded sufficient impact on the economy, the CBN pushed back stoutly, saying measures adopted during the period saved key sectors of the country from being exposed to more severe devastation.  On Tuesday, the NESG sponsored a publication titled ""Matters of Urgent Attention"", in which critical issues were raised spanning key policy interventions of the government and the CBN in the agricultural and other sectors of the economy.  The NESG is a non-partisan, non-profit group of private and public sector leaders representing key economic sectors committed to deliberate dialogue on the development, growth, performance, and future of the Nigerian economy.  Issues by NESG  In its publication, the NESG criticised some of the government policies, including those by the CBN, which it noted, failed to impact the country's economy.  The NESG said in spite of the increased focus by the present administration on agriculture, the need to ensure zero hunger, and increased budgetary as well as disbursement of funds by CBN, the apex bank's Anchor Borrowers' Programme (ABP) has failed to halt hunger among Nigerians.  Noting that the issues transcend money, the NESG said it required a complete overhaul of the management and support for agriculture and related sectoral value chain.  Also, it expressed concern about the impact of the growing insecurity nationwide on the business environment and investment flows, resulting in the current food crisis, unemployment, poverty, increasing community clashes, rising bloodshed and a dearth of peace and tranquillity in the country.  On the impact of the recently enacted Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020 on businesses, the economic group said if properly implemented, it will boost the growth of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).  The NESG faulted the CBN on its handling of foreign exchange transactions, loan disbursements (intervention funds) and price fixings without appropriate policy clarity, arguing this could be subject to abuses, manipulations and significant market disruptions, ""reflective of a policy akin to crony capitalism.  ""We therefore respectfully request the appropriate authorities to properly review this policy to restore credibility into our financial sector,"" the group said.  On the concerns over the re-enacted' Bank and Other Financial Institutions Act 2020, the NESG, drew attention to certain provisions that breach the Constitution and conferring immunity on CBN and its officials against judicial review.  The group called on the President to withhold his assent until the Bill was properly reviewed, amended and made fit for purpose.  CBN reacts  In its reaction, the CBN said its policies were measures taken to support the stability of the country's financial system and enable faster recovery of the economy following the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.  The CBN said its policies during the period were informed by the over 65 per cent drop in commodity prices; disruptions in global supply chains and the unprecedented outflow of over $100 billion of debt and equity funds from emerging markets between March and May 2020.  These developments, the CBN said, led to over 60 per cent reduction in revenues to the Federation Account, a significant drop in foreign currency inflows, resulting in imported inflation due to the downward adjustments in the Naira/dollar exchange rate and a rise in inflation.  To stabilise the economy from an extraordinary shock, the CBN said it had to take extraordinary measures to increase the flow of credit to critical sectors of the economy, enable faster recovery of the economy and prevent the economic crisis from spilling into a major financial crisis.  Some of the measures, it said, included a one-year extension of a moratorium on principal repayments for CBN intervention facilities; strengthening of the loan to deposit ratio policy; creation of a N50 billion target credit facility for affected households and small and medium enterprises through the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank.  Other measures included the creation of an N100 billion intervention fund in loans to pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners intending to expand and strengthen the capacity of our healthcare institutions; creation of a research fund to support the development of vaccines in Nigeria.  Also, the CBN said a N1 trillion facility in loans was established to boost local manufacturing and production across critical sectors; regulatory forbearance granted to banks to restructure loans to sectors affected by the pandemic.  The loan-to-deposit ratio policy, the CBN explained, resulted in a significant rise by over 21 in loans provided by financial institutions to banking customers in the past year, while mobilization of key stakeholders resulted in the provision of over N23bn in relief materials to affected households, and the set-up of 39 COVID-19 isolation centres nationwide.  Impact of other measures  The impact of other measures adopted by the bank included the provision of palliatives to individuals affected by the pandemic, increase in access to credit to critical sectors of the economy that were either high employers of labour or have the ability to create jobs at a fast pace, helped in containing a significant decline in gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the second quarter of the year.  CBN insists its development finance activities during the period positively impacted many ordinary Nigerians, including smallholder farmers, households, and medium-scale entrepreneurs across the country.  Specifically, the CBN said details published in its monthly economic report showed a total of N38.11 billion was disbursed as loans to 44,458 beneficiaries through the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank (NMFB), with the number rising to about N59.12 billion and support to 103,189 beneficiaries as of August 2020.  Besides, the apex bank said its intervention programmes in the agricultural sector contributed to the resilience of the sector during the crisis, resulting in a positive growth of 1.6 per cent in the second quarter of the year despite the lockdown.  ""As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, and Thailand placed export restrictions on the exports of critical food items, including rice and eggs.  ""With these disruptions, the Nigerian economy could have faced a major food crisis, but for the government's intervention programmes in the agriculture sector,"" the CBN said.

Faulting NESG's argument that money cannot address constraints in the agriculture sector, the CBN drew attention to the listing of access to credit among the three major challenges farmers and businesses faced in Nigeria.  It said while the government sought to address the challenges of access to electricity and logistic constraints faced by businesses, CBN took up the responsibility to address the flow of credit to critical sectors of the economy.  On alleged improper lending framework, the CBN said all recipients of its intervention funds go through an expansive due diligence process through participating financial institutions (PFIs), with additional assessment process before disbursements.  On the BOFIA Act, the CBN pushed back on NESG's observations, saying they were borne out of ""total ignorance or malicious intent.""  ""First, the provision referred to as being currently conceived as part of the new BOFIA already exists as Section 53 in the old Act, which is now Section 51 in the amended Act passed by the National Assembly. The current bill has not proposed any changes to that section at all.  ""Second, contrary to their misleading anxiety and associated reportage, the provision of Section 51 does not purport to confer immunity on the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria like that which obtains for State Governors.  ""Rather, this provision protects the Federal Government, the Central Bank of Nigeria and their respective officials against adverse claims for actions or omission in good faith exercise of powers under BOFIA and other specified statutes including the Central Bank of Nigeria Act and regulations made thereunder,"" the CBN said."

In a virtual meeting with counterparts from the 10-member ASEAN, China and South Korea, Motegi also said Japan will provide Southeast Asian countries with health care equipment and extend emergency yen loans to help their post-pandemic economic recovery, according to the Foreign Ministry.  China and South Korea have also pledged to contribute to the fund, which currently totals $2.3 million, with the amount expected to increase, a ministry official said.  Motegi vowed to work toward the establishment of an ASEAN center for emerging diseases and public health emergencies, intended to help protect people from the threat of a pandemic in the long term, the ministry said.  The entity, to be funded by Tokyo, was first proposed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a virtual summit of ASEAN plus China, South Korea and Japan in April.  Speaking during Wednesday's talks, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh, who chaired the meeting, said he looks forward to stepping up ASEAN-plus-three cooperation so as to ""effectively sustain the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigate immediate effects and promote sustainable development.""  South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said she wants to strengthen coordination with her counterparts in achieving a ""resilient region underpinned by strong multilateralism.""  Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for ""sound momentum in the East Asian cooperation (to) turn the COVID-19 crisis into a development of opportunities.""  In separate talks with ASEAN foreign ministers, Motegi said he shared Tokyo's ""concerns"" with the regional bloc about China's assertive territorial claims in the East and South China seas.  ""I would like to promote cooperation with ASEAN countries, who share many points of (our) vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific,"" Motegi told reporters in Tokyo after the meetings.  The concept promoting the rule of law and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific area was coined by Abe in a veiled counter to China's rising clout in the region.

Afte… [+25404 chars]","The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today’s noon briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General.  All right. Good afternoon to you all, and a happy Friday to you.  After finishing my briefing and the questions, Reem Abaza will be here to brief on behalf of the President of the General Assembly. As you know, this is her last briefing as Spokeswoman for the President of the General Assembly, as the new President will take over the seventy-fifth [session] with a new spokesperson, Brenden Varma. I think we all agree that Reem has been absolutely fantastic during her job here, and, in fact, much, much nicer than me when faced with unpleasant questions. So Reem, thank you for your great work over this past year and we hope to keep seeing you in some other capacity.  ** Peacebuilding  In remarks to a virtual session of the General Assembly and the Security Council this morning, the Secretary-General discussed his 2020 review of the peacebuilding architecture.  He told Member States that, looking at the suffering around the world, we know that the human and financial cost of focusing primarily on crisis response is unsustainable.  He said that at the centre of his 2020 Report is the conviction that multidimensional, integrated and whole-of-society responses are vital to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century and leave no one behind.  He added that despite this progress, adequate, predictable and sustained financing for peacebuilding remains a critical challenge. His remarks have been made available to you.  ** Afghanistan  Today, the Special Representative and Head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), Deborah Lyons, said that the UN family in the country welcomes the upcoming face-to-face peace talks between Afghan parties in Doha, Qatar. She stressed that the suffering of the Afghan people has gone on for far too long.  Ms. Lyons said that tomorrow’s opening event can be the start of something truly momentous and negotiators from the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban have a unique opportunity to save the lives of many of their compatriots and to lift the country out of poverty and misery.  Ms. Lyons wished them every success and emphasized that the UN will be there to support them, as required.  While the ultimate goal of the talks is to silence the guns forever, [an immediate and unconditional reduction] in violence would create a more conducive environment for constructive talks, she added. In the context of the health and economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 virus, poverty and natural disasters, a pause to the fighting would enable critical humanitarian aid to reach the millions that require assistance across Afghanistan.  ** Security Council  Security Council members met in a closed video teleconference session this morning on Myanmar.  Council members were briefed by the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener; the High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi; and Kanni Wignaraja, the [UN Development Programme’s] Assistant Administrator and Director of the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific.  ** Greece  Turning to the situation in Greece, the Secretary-General, in a tweet posted last night, said that he has been following the devastation from the fire at the Moria camp on the island of Lesvos. He added that the solution lies in caring for all people affected, especially the most vulnerable, starting with transferring the population to the mainland.  The initial fire broke out on 8 September causing extensive damage to thousands of shelters for asylum seekers and common areas.  Today, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said that more fires were reported on 9 September, as well as yesterday. The latest fires have affected the adjacent fields next to the Moria Reception and Identification Centre, destroying what remaining accommodations were still available.  While no casualties have been reported to date, the fires have now left 11,500 asylum seekers without adequate shelter, sleeping on streets, fields and beaches on the island. Among them are 2,200 women and 4,000 children.  The UN Refugee Agency warned that the coronavirus pandemic is also adding to an already desperate situation. UNHCR has been offering support to Greek authorities to help protect and assist the impacted asylum seekers.  ** Mexico  The [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)] and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) today condemned the murder of journalist Julio Valdivia Rodríguez in the state of Veracruz in Mexico.  He worked as a correspondent for a newspaper in the border region between the states of Veracruz and Oaxaca. Mr. Valdivia Rodríguez is the fourth journalist to have been murdered in Mexico this year.  The human rights office and UNESCO call on the authorities to investigate his murder in accordance with the standards of due diligence so that this crime does not remain unpunished. The Secretary-General lends his voice to this condemnation and, as you know, he has repeatedly spoken out on this issue, stressing that all journalists should be able to do their work freely and in safety, without fear of death or harm.  ** COVID-19 — Cambodia  On Cambodia, we have an update on what our colleagues in the UN team there, led by Resident Coordinator Pauline Tamesis, are doing to address the COVID-19 pandemic.  The UN and the Government are working together to help the poorest households, rolling out a cash transfer scheme that will help an initial group of more than 600,000 people living below the poverty line. We have provided 1,700 tablets to authorities to track these transfers and identify health, nutrition and educational needs. This has led to cash transfers to include pregnant women and households with children below the age of 2.  The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, and UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) are helping the Government with distance learning for the more than 3 million students who are out of school due to the pandemic. Educational programmes are being broadcast on official channels and over social media networks, with more than 1 million views. The UN’s work on education also includes sign language, braille and radio programmes for multilingual education.  ** Cambodia  And, on a separate issue on Cambodia, the UN human rights office today expressed its concern over the recent arrests of human rights defenders. [OHCHR] calls on the Government to immediately and unconditionally release people detained for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. It also calls on the Government to end intimidation of civil society actors.  ** Palestine  Turning to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Humanitarian Coordinator there, Jamie McGoldrick, said that the Israeli authorities’ policy of demolishing Palestinian-owned structures has continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic, undermining many people’s access to livelihoods and services.  In a statement issued yesterday, he said that, from March to August of this year, 389 Palestinian-owned structures in the West Bank were demolished or confiscated. That is an average of 65 per month, the highest average in four years. More than 400 Palestinians have been left homeless due to these demolitions.  ** Sudan  On Sudan, which saw torrential rains and floods this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today that it is providing surgical supplies and medicine.  Nearly 30 health facilities were damaged, although this has not led to a major interruption in services.  WHO said that Sudan’s health system continues [to suffer] from years of underfunding, staff shortages, weakened infrastructure, and the lack of equipment, essential medicines and supplies.  Together with the Government and its partners, WHO has identified health needs and responded to disease alerts, including diarrhoea, measles, COVID-19, and others. More information online.  And that is it from me. Before we turn to Reem… bear with me two seconds.  ** Questions and Answers  All right. Oh, James Bays with a week’s worth of questions, I have no doubt.  Question : I’ve got three, if that’s okay. So, first to pick up on one of the things that you were just talking about, Afghanistan and the forthcoming talks between the Government and the Taliban, you said what the SRSG’s (Special Representative of the Secretary-General) view was. Can I ask you about the Secretary‑General’s view on the situation? Given that it’s 19 years since US troops arrived, a country that’s had 40 years of conflict, with that historical perspective, how does the SG see this moment and the chances for peace?  I think you might have frozen.  Spokesman : James, I have to tell you, James, while you were away, things were working absolutely perfectly. We had sound; we had video, but I’m just disappointed you didn’t use your time off to get a haircut, but anyway, go ahead. Let’s try again.  Question : Do you want me to ask the question again?  Spokesman : Yes, please, if you don’t mind.  Question : Yeah. So, 40 years of conflicts in Afghanistan, 19 years since the Americans arrived. We heard what the SRSG says, but what does the SG think? Given that historical perspective, how does the SG see this moment and the possibilities of the chance of peace?  Spokesman : For him, I think the start of the negotiations are a major opportunity to achieve what has been the long‑held aspirations of the people of Afghanistan for peace. It’s crucial that all Afghan leaders and members of the international community do everything possible to make the peace a reality. We, obviously, stand ready to help.  I think, obviously, one of the… there are many critical issues that will have to be looked at, but I think one that always needs underscoring is to ensure that the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan are not overlooked and that they have… their voices, their rights and their lives are respected and protected.  The Secretary‑General will be speaking to the Afghan talks in Doha via pre-recorded video message, and we will share with you an embargoed version of the message, which will be embargoed till some point overnight.  Question : The second question regards Libya, and there is now a new draft resolution for the UNSMIL (United Nations Support Mission in Libya) mandate, which looks like it’s going to be put to a vote early next week. It is suggesting a formula that maybe will break the deadlock on this issue. As you know, the US have been wanting to divide the roles in two, and now they’re suggesting there will be a Special Envoy who concentrates on mediation but, under his authority, there will be a day‑to‑day coordinator.  One, are the Secretariat happy with this compromise measure? And number two, now that it looks like there is something potentially moving forward, do you have a new candidate for the Special Envoy role? And do you hope that now can be filled very quickly?  Spokesman : Well, I mean, we, obviously, are guided by whatever emanates from the Security Council chambers. We do understand there will be a new mandate with possibly a new structure. The Secretary‑General will act upon it. The issue of leadership is one that we hope will be solved quickly.  In the meantime, Stephanie Williams remains firmly in charge of the Mission.  Your third question.  Question : Third and a final question. I’m crediting the reporting of PassBlue on this one. The UN General Assembly speakers list, you have to wait… despite this gender equality being one of the main themes of this GA and of the UN in general, you have to wait 53 speakers for a woman speaker, none on the first day of the general debate. Is the Secretary‑General happy with that?  Spokesman : Well, I think the Secretary‑General and the UN is… various UN agencies have always called for more women in leadership positions. It is not, as you well know, for the Secretary‑General, A, to establish the speakers list… and, most importantly, to decide who is the Head of State, Head of Government, Foreign Minister of each country. It is clear that the world would benefit from greater representation of women at the highest levels. We’re not there.  For his part, the Secretary‑General, I think, has pushed through very audacious and strong push on gender equality. And as you know, at the leadership level at the UN, we do have full… we have gender parity. Welcome back, James.  Evelyn, and then Ali.  Question : Yes. Hi, Steph. Is there any word on 9/11? It’s the nineteenth anniversary today, and we’re all in New York.  Spokesman : No, I mean, it’s… very much aware of the nineteenth… marking of the nineteenth anniversary of the Twin Tower [attacks]. I think, for the UN, it’s both personal and professional in a sense. All of us who work here, whether staff members, diplomats and journalists, are also New Yorkers. Many of us were here on that day. I know of a number of colleagues who lost loved ones during the attack. So, it’s a sombre day, a day of commemoration.  And globally, it was also… it marked the start of a new world, so to speak, but we did see, I think, tremendous global solidarity here at the UN in the days… in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and we saw the world speaking in one voice against terrorism.  Okay. Ali?  Question : Thank you. Thank you, Steph. I have a question on Lebanon… [cross talk]  Spokesman : Are you on a boat? [laughter]  Question : I wish.  Spokesman : Yeah, yeah.  Question : So, yesterday, there was a huge fire at the very port that witnessed the huge explosion, and there is a lot of damage, including, they say, evidence but also some assistance came from all over the world to Lebanon were vanished.  I wonder whether you have information about whether the UN aid sustained any damage or anything. And what would you say about just erasing the evidence from what possibly could be a crime scene?  Spokesman : No. I mean, listen, we’re aware of the secondary fire that broke out. As far as I know, we have no information as to the source of it or what could have happened. We’ve… we’re aware of a number of different theories, but I have no… we have no forensic information, so to speak.  Our work in Lebanon continues. I think, as we outlined yesterday, we’re continuing to help the people of Beirut, all of the people regardless of whether they’re citizens, refugees or migrants, and we will continue to do that.  Question : Was there any damage to UN aid? And I have another question. [cross talk]  Spokesman : I’m not aware. None has been reported up to me. Doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, but none’s been reported.  Question : Uh‑huh. And my other question is about the rising tension in the Eastern Mediterranean and whether the United Nations or the Secretary‑General has anything to say about what’s happening there.  Spokesman : Not that I’ve… nothing more than what I said last week, that we’ve been in touch with the various parties, and we very much hope that these current tensions will be solved through diplomatic channels.  We’ve noted there’ve been direct talks between the Turkish and Greek representatives under the auspices of NATO, and we hope this dialogue will continue in a positive atmosphere.  Okay. Abdelhamid, then Edie.  Question : Thank you, Stéphane. First, a follow‑up to my question yesterday about Israeli violation of Lebanese airspace by a drone, and you said you would get back to me about it, and then I have another question. [cross talk]  Spokesman : Okay. What I can tell you is that, yesterday, around 5:20 p.m. local time, I assume, the Lebanese Armed Forces informed UNIFIL (United Interim Force in Lebanon) that it had shot down a drone it said was coming from Israel in the general area of Ayta ash Shab in southern Lebanon. A UNIFIL team visited the site and inspected the drone that the Lebanese Armed Forces had claimed to have downed.  UNIFIL is currently following up with the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) to confirm the identity of the drone in question and has launched an investigation into the incident.  Go ahead.  Question : Stéphane, about the Saudi courts which issued the sentences about those guilty of killing [Jamal] Khashoggi, and they said the case is closed. It didn’t satisfy international standards. You know, the statement of Agnès Callamard and the statement of Mr. [Rupert] Colville, the Spokesman for UNHCR [sic]. My question is not hypothetical; it’s procedural. Suppose Turkey came up to the Secretary‑General with a demand to investigate it. What would…  Spokesman : Sorry. Say again.  Question : Suppose Turkey, now, requested an international investigation and submitted an official request to the Secretary‑General. What would be the response of the Secretary‑General?  Spokesman : Look, the fact is we have never officially received any request for an official investigation from any country on this. Should one be received, it would be studied, and we would have to see exactly what it says and what it’s asking. So, I think we’ve… I’ll leave it at that.  Correspondent : Thank you.  Spokesman : Okay. Edie?  Question : Thank you, Steph. I have a couple of questions also. First, does the Secretary‑General have any comment on Syria reporting Israeli air strikes near Aleppo? Apparently, the Syrians say these have been going on in recent weeks.  Spokesman : Listen, we… I have no specific information on these reported air strike. I think our message to the parties is the same, is that what Syria needs is a re‑commitment by all the parties and those who have an influence over the parties to peaceful… to the political dialogue led by the UN. But as far as these reports of air strikes, I have nothing… I have no specific information on those at this point.  Your next question.  Question : On Myanmar, you told us who briefed. We didn’t get any indication of what they might have said. I realize this is a closed meeting but Myanmar is a major issue and… [cross talk]  Spokesman : I understand. Let me see what we can squeeze out and share with you.  Question : Okay. And, thirdly, can you remind us when the Secretary‑General’s pre‑UNGA (United Nations General Assembly) press conference is going to be? And is the UN going to be putting out a compiled list of side events?  Spokesman : Yes. The list… we’ll see what we’ll share with you what we can. It will not be a long list.  On the press conference, so is there… and we’ll send out an email with all the information. The Secretary‑General will be in the press briefing room on the 16th of… on Wednesday next week for his big pre‑GA press conference. If you’re inter… we will have… we are capping the limit of journalists in the room at 10 with masks. Please contact UNCA (United Nations Correspondents Association), as they are coordinating the access.  We expect the Deputy Secretary‑General to be with us the next day to talk about the SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) moment and the SDG‑related issues coming to the GA, and we’re trying to also organize some sort of background briefing for you guys on the Secretary‑General’s speech, which he’ll deliver on the 22nd, and there will also be an embargoed press briefing at some point next week by Fabrizio Hochschild on the UN75 and the results of the survey. The results will be released on the 21st, but we’re organizing a briefing for you ahead of that.  And just so you know, I will be doing briefings remotely Monday and Tuesday. There will not be a noon briefing on Wednesday. I will be in the building on Thursday and then back remotely on Friday. And then next week, on Monday, I will probably brief, and then during the first couple of days of the GA, we will not be briefing, and that’s it.  Iftikhar, and then Ben and… yes, Iftikhar and then Ben.  Question : Thank you, Steph. My question on Afghanistan was asked by James, but may I ask you whether any UN representative will be physically present in Qatar to monitor intra‑Afghan dialogue?  Spokesman : Yes, the Special Representative of the Secretary‑General will be in Doha. She will not be at the table, as this is not a UN process, but she will be able to monitor the talks. But she will be in Doha.  Ben, if you don’t mind, I skipped over Ibtisam, and I’d like to hear from her.  Ibtisam?  Question : Yeah, thank you, Steph. So, my question is about Egypt. Human Rights Watch issued a long report today about a case of gang rape in which the victim is being accused… the part of the Human Rights is saying that the Egyptian authorities have arrested the witnesses to the gang rape after encouraging them to come forward instead of prosecuting… instead of protecting them and prosecuting the attackers. The case against the witnesses and the smear campaign against them and the rape survivor send a chilling message to survivors of sexual violence. The report says that they can go to prison if they report sexual violence. Do you have any comment or statement about that?  Spokesman : Look, I’ve just seen the Human Rights Watch report which you flagged to us, so we’re looking… and our colleagues at the human rights office, we’ve asked them to look into what’s clearly a very troubling report. What I can tell you, as a matter of principle, because we’ve heard reports of these types of a reaction in many parts of the world and that, as a matter of principle, is that survivors of sexual assault need to be heard; they need to be protected, and they need to be encouraged to report cases, as well as witnesses to these attacks.  And that’s… the ability to come forward, either as a victim or as a witness, and be protected is really fundamental to the rule of law. Anything that deters that, I think, is a challenge to a goal that we all share, which is equal protection under the law.  But we’ll try to get some details on that particular case. [cross talk]  Question : I have a follow‑up. I… just to understand, to which extent such issues come up when… especially that we see partly, not only in Egypt, but in other countries, as you said, systematic or ill‑treatment of victims, racist too in other countries, to which extent these issues come up in meetings between the Secretary‑General and Head of States? Because… yeah.  Spokesman : Well, they… different issues come up in different meetings as appropriate, but this is an issue that the Secretary‑General has been very vocal about. We have regular reporting from the Special Representative on sexual violence. This also comes up regularly in human rights reports, in reports from UN-Women, from the Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights, so this is something that we always try to shine a light on and do not shy away from.  Mr. Evansky?  Question : Thank you. Just on the SG’s presser, what time is that going to be?  Spokesman : Noon.  Question : Okay.  Spokesman : And he usually is on time, as opposed to me.  Question : Okay. You mentioned about the idea of 14‑day quarantine for leaders and delegations coming in, but is there some sort of rule that diplomats can bypass that and just visit for 24 hours?  Spokesman : Any issues having to do between diplomats and the host country, that’s a question you need to ask the host country. What I can tell you is, on the part of the UN staff, we have not asked for any derogation. As you know, the Secretary‑General himself went to Portugal. He came back, stayed two weeks in the residence. A number of other colleagues that I… we work with every day, Melissa Fleming or others, come back and they follow the two‑week… they follow the quarantine. So, we make it a point to follow the guidelines and the instructions from the host city, from the host authority.  We encourage, as we always do, the diplomatic community, the UN community here in New York, to follow the rules and guidelines of the host country. But whether or not there’s a derogation, that’s a discussion that needs to be held between each permanent mission and the host country.  Stefano Vaccara?  Question : Thank you, Stéphane. I’m sorry I got late today, so probably this was… I don’t know if it was asked already or it was asked yesterday. So, we found out that [Donald] Trump knew well before how dangerous the COVID‑19 was and how it could be spread and everything.  So, when exactly did Secretary‑General knew the kind of the same information than… that we know President Trump practically find out at the end of January? Did the Secretary‑General find out exactly how dangerous was this new virus, before, after? Can you give us a timing?  Spokesman : No, I… listen, I’m not going to get into this Washington debate that’s ongoing. What I can tell you is that the Secretary‑General has always been guided by the advice he received from the World Health Organization (WHO), which was advice that was shared publicly.  Question : I’m sorry. Now, just a… now, because… it’s not because I want you to comment on Washington or President Trump. It’s just that the debate that is worldwide is that the leadership of the world, so not only in America, failed everywhere in making aware people how dangerous and how the virus… [cross talk]  Spokesman : The Secretary‑General did not sit on any knowledge that he had about the severity of this virus that he did not speak to publicly.  Okay. I think that comes to the end of our programming. So, for one last time, I get to throw it over to Reem. Reem, thank you again for your cooperation and have fun."

Advertisement  Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all?  First, it was the queen who was the fairest of them all. Then, it was Snow White. The result was that Snow White became the object of the queen’s hatred.  What lesson can we draw from this famous fairy-tale for Cambodia after the loss of approximately 20 percent of its tariff-free exports to the European market, which it enjoyed under the EU’s Everything But Arms (EBA) trade scheme?  Answers to the question may vary, but one lesson Cambodia post-EBA can learn is to move beyond the narrative along the lines of the EU’s “double standards.” This narrative has not helped to save the EBA status. In fact, it could be counterproductive, potentially damaging Cambodia-EU relations in the long term. Moreover, accusing the EU of holding double standards in its treatment of Cambodia is not politically viable. After all, Cambodia has already lost a portion of the benefits it enjoyed under the EBA program. The country should do something to avoid losing more.  Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter  It is therefore time for post-EBA Cambodia to move beyond the narrative that the EU is wrong, unfair or hypocritical. Cambodia itself is not doing well in terms of human rights, as evidenced by a number of arrests in recent months. Many of those arrests have been seen as arbitrary, aiming to silence critical voices.  Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.  It is high time for Cambodia to constructively engage the EU to avoid losing more benefits the bloc has to offer, particularly under the EBA trade scheme. Name-calling or dubbing the EU’s EBA withdrawal as “extreme injustice” will only prove ineffective and divisive. The EU has stated that it partially withdrew the EBA trade scheme from Cambodia due to “serious and systematic concerns related to human rights” in the Kingdom.  These concerns are linked with recent political developments in Cambodia that has brought to the fore the government’s crackdown on critics and the opposition, notably its dissolution of the only viable opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), in November 2017. These developments in domestic politics have led the EU and other partners of Cambodia to perceive that democracy in this Southeast Asian country has gone backward. Cambodia may perceive otherwise, but as the saying goes, it takes two to tango. The EU did not begin the EBA withdrawal process for no reason. Its so-called double standards may be seen as a response to the Cambodian government’s new “standard” of democracy.  Blaming the EU for partially withdrawing the EBA from Cambodia at a time when Cambodia’s economy is facing severe challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic seems reasonable. Yet, it is important to understand that Brussels began the formal procedure to partially withdraw EBA from Phnom Penh in October 2018, about 14 months before the emergence of the coronavirus. Cambodia has had a lot of time to reverse its democratic drift, but has instead spent much of the time fighting back rather than engaging in constructive dialogue and meaningful negotiations. Unfortunately, confrontation appears to have been the name of the game both before and after the EBA was partially withdrawn.  Advertisement  It is worth noting that when the EBA withdrawal decision took effect on August 12, the EU noted that if the country made a “substantial improvement” in human rights and labor rights, “fully free access to the EU market for products from Cambodia” would be restored. Thus, the solution to the EBA issue seems to lie in the hands of the Cambodian government, whose actions initiated the EU’s decision to withdraw its EBA preferences in the first place. The key to solving this issue relies on the Cambodian government’s willingness, commitment and prioritization.  One can ask the following questions: Is the Cambodian government willing to compromise to regain the full EBA status? Is Cambodia willing to lose further EBA benefits to protect its independence and sovereignty – as the government claims? Is the Cambodian government committed to improving the human rights situation in the country? Is it committed to promoting democracy and the rule of law? What is the government’s main priority concerning the EBA preferences?  If the Cambodian government is unwilling to compromise with the EU to promote political and human rights in the country, further loss of the EBA status could well be the outcome. This scenario, should it happen, would be no surprise. Sweden has already decided to phase out its development aid for the Cambodian government and redirect it to assist democracy advocates, human rights defenders and civil society organizations. This decision will come into force in July 2021.  The EU may well calculate that a complete withdrawal of EBA from Cambodia would push Phnom Penh closer to Beijing. The geopolitical consequence of Cambodia’s further embrace of China appears to be far-reaching given rumors and speculations that Cambodia and China have signed a secret deal to allow the latter access to the Ream Naval Base close to Sihanoukville.  The real problem for Cambodia now is that its export-driven economy has been severely undermined by the combined effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the EBA withdrawal. The World Bank has predicted that the Cambodian economy will this year experience its worst performance since 1994, contracting between 1 and 2.9 percent. The Asian Development Bank’s projection is worse: a contraction of 5.5 percent. The dual impact of the pandemic and the EBA withdrawal has been particularly felt in the country’s dominant garment manufacturing sector, where around 250 factories had suspended operations as of mid-2020.  Moving forward, Cambodia must focus on the diversification of its export markets, revitalization of the underdeveloped agricultural industry and improvement of services and infrastructure in the tourism sector, among many other challenges.  While a lot has been done in terms of free trade negotiations, and while the government’s focus on the long-neglected agriculture sector seems to be growing amid the COVID-19 pandemic, greater attention needs to be paid to the facilitation of new local and foreign investment. Cambodia must also prioritize education and research by aggressively investing in the education sector to increase its relevance and competitiveness in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.  The National Steering Committee for Covid-19 Prevention and Control has said that it is necessary now to ""live safely with the pandemic,"" and to allow experts and investors into the nation for the cause of socio-economic development.  For this, it is vital to implement a plan to perform rapid tests at border gates, airports, hospitals and mass gathering events, ensuring timely detection of infections and prevention of community transmissions.  Experts have suggested the Health Ministry draw from experiences of Germany, India, Japan, South Korea and Thailand in performing tests on passengers when resuming some international routes.  Acting Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said that for now, Vietnam was not considering letting tourists in.  He said experts and skilled workers entering Vietnam for short-term stays of less than 14 days would not have to stay in centralized quarantine facilities. But they must be confirmed negative by RT-PCR testing three-five days before entry.  Once they enter Vietnam, they have to be tested and samples collected for more tests every two days.  The Ministry of Science and Technology said at the meeting that it will buy test kits from two local medical firms, Sao Thai Duong Joint Stock Company and Medicon Co., Ltd., for the Covid-19 antigen detection tests.  As explained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, antigen detection test can quickly detect fragments of proteins found on or within the virus by testing samples collected from the nasal cavity using swabs.  Vietnam has been using the antigen detection test kit using the real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to diagnose infections of the novel coronavirus.  This method promises greater accuracy but requires high skills and complicated operation processes, apart from taking quite a long time to get the result, said Nguyen Cong Tac, deputy Minister of Science and Technology.  For now, local companies have been working on producing antigen detection test kits that can make use of existing equipment and machinery in Vietnam, take shorter time to come up with the results that are as precise as those analyzed by the RT-PCR method, he said.  Sao Thai Duong has completed making the new test kit and submitted it to the authorities for assessment and approval while Medicon is in the process of doing so.  Once completed, Medicon expects to sell each of its antigen detection test kit for $3.50, which is 70 percent of the global average price for the product.  The health and science-technology ministries are responsible for checking and assessing all antigen detection test kits produced by local firms.  The nation’s aviation authorities had said early this month that they have prepared detailed plans for resuming commercial flights to six Northeast and Southeast Asian destinations this month.  The Ministry of Transport and other relevant agencies have submitted plans to the Covid-19 steering committee, asking for flights to resume to Guangzhou, Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, Cambodia and Laos from September 15, with all foreign passengers quarantined on arrival.  Vietnam suspended all international flights on March 25. Many foreigners who have been kept out of Vietnam due to travel restrictions have pleaded with the government to reopen the borders and resume international flights so that they could reunite with their families.  On Thursday, Vietnam entered its seventh day in a row without community transmission of the novel coronavirus.  The nation has registered 1,059 Covid-19 cases so far with 890 recoveries and 35 deaths."

The authorities questioned Andrew Ng, who explained the church was the only institution willing to provide space for ElShaddai to meet. If the mosque across the street were willing to open its doors, he said, ElShaddai would be more than happy to meet there. That ended the controversy.  While some in the larger Muslim community might be suspicious, many Muslim refugee families send their children to ElShaddai, knowing they will receive a quality English education. They also receive character education with lessons on Biblical values such as integrity, honesty, and patience. Ng Oi Leng sees ElShaddai as an opportunity to show students God’s love and answer their questions. The school also offers Christians the opportunity to love those whom the larger culture disdains.  Suspicion also comes from some churches. They fear working with Muslims could get them in trouble with authorities. Others are uncomfortable working with undocumented foreigners. Still others don’t want to help because they are focused on increasing their own numbers.  Where those Christians see danger or distraction, Andrew Ng sees opportunity. God is bringing people from around the world to Malaysia with very tangible needs—and the school is the means for Christians to reach them. By building trust as educators, teachers and staffers visit their students’ families and get to know community needs and leaders. They send in medical teams to provide treatment and prenatal care for migrants with little access to healthcare.  Although the school has a reputation for its excellent English education, it has also proven itself flexible and willing to change its offerings to meet the needs of its diverse community and reach beyond its comfortable church setting.  ElShaddai created a special accelerated learning program for Rohingya, who are often illiterate and lack formal education. Beyond core subjects—math, English, and science—the school emphasizes life skills (finances and taking care of a family) because Rohingya typically marry young.  ElShaddai staffers realized that Afghan women have little education or English-language skills, so they set up adult classes for them. They also found that many Afghan refugees are capable seamstresses, so they helped create a sewing center. During the pandemic, an NGO paid the refugees to sew masks and PPE for front-line doctors fighting the coronavirus.  THREE YEARS AGO, ElShaddai took an unusual step in order to reach more students. Instead of transporting students to St. Barnabas, feeding them, and looking for churches to offer classroom space, ElShaddai sent teachers into existing migrant-run community schools. Those schools offered rudimentary classes taught in their native languages, but they lacked qualified teachers for English and other core subjects. ElShaddai teachers have raised the educational quality and prepared students for an internationally recognized certificate. ElShaddai now has 10 of those subcenters.  A year later, the school went further. The parent of a Rohingya student was also a leader in the local Muslim community. When teachers from ElShaddai visited the family, they asked if the school could bring a medical team into that community. The Rohingya leader agreed and set it up in the Muslim religious madrassa. Seeing the available space and convenience, Andrew Ng asked if ElShaddai could bring teachers into the madrassa to teach math, science, and English so that parents wouldn’t need to send their kids all the way to the school. The leaders eagerly agreed.  In the morning, the students study the core subjects—including the character classes—with their ElShaddai teachers. In the afternoon they study the Quran with madrassa teachers. Andrew Ng says if students only learn the Quran, they are prepared only to become imams or religious police when they grow up. With a well-rounded education, their options become much broader. Currently ElShaddai is teaching in four Rohingya madrassas.  ElShaddai’s secondary school, Excel, meets a few blocks away from St. Bar­nabas in a rented space in Klang’s Little India, sandwiched between Bollywood video stores, Indian spice shops, and the blue-domed Masjid India mosque. It began in 2017 and now has 50 students.  This year, eight students plan to take their International General Certificate of Secondary Education exams to become ElShaddai’s first class of graduates, yet concern looms about what comes next. Brima’s son James is one of the eight students preparing for the test, and he worries about how James can afford university fees on their current salary.  Brima knows going back to Liberia isn’t an option even though the country is calmer than when he left. The man responsible for his parents’ death is an important figure in the Liberian army. Brima fears if he ever steps foot back in Liberia, he could be killed.  “What happened to us, we did not pray for it,” Brima said. “No refugee prays, ‘I want a catastrophe to fall on our nation so we can be a refugee.’ Every human wants to live a better life.”  Moneybox  2019 income: $525,267  2019 expenses: $581,545  Paid staff and semi-volunteers with some allowance: 138  CEO’s salary: $12,096  Website: ecb.org.my"

He made the remarks at a Wednesday meeting of the Committee on Economic Matters of the 41st General Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA 41).  ""Tourism travel bubbles"" would include specialized air routes to tourism sites in member countries, Tien explained. It means people traveling from and to different destinations are tested to make sure they are not infected with the novel coronavirus, and that they would visit only those tourism sites before returning, using transport within a closed loop. ""Green countries"" are defined as those that ensure certain green coverage and use organic products, Tien said.  The Covid-19 pandemic is not only a medical crisis, but a crisis in development when international trade and supply chains are broken, Tien stated. Southeast Asia’s GDP growth this year is expected to drop to negative 2.7 percent, as opposed to an increase of 4.4 percent last year, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  ""The Vietnamese delegation wants the ASEAN community to agree on executing a series of breakthroughs and possible solutions, first to enhance information exchange regarding tourism, health and other necessary methods to control the spread of Covid-19,"" he added.  Also at the meeting, Vietnam suggested hastening the ratification of trade agreements within the region, including completing negotiations and signings of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) within 2020. Increasing the capacity and participation of parliamentary oversight regarding the implementation of trade and investment commitments within the regional and international framework was also tabled.  As the coronavirus pandemic ravages the globe, countries and territories have deployed different measures to curb its spread, including international travel restrictions. Vietnam, for example, had already suspended international flights since late March.  As Vietnam began to bring the Covid-19 outbreak under control, talks of resuming international flights took off. Most recently, Vietnamese aviation authorities have prepared detailed plans for resuming commercial flights to Guangzhou, Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, Cambodia, and Laos starting September 15.  Passengers arriving in Vietnam must have been in these Asian destinations for at least 30 days prior to boarding their flights, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV). Transit passengers will not be allowed in.  Passengers must also furnish a certificate showing they tested negative for the novel coronavirus within three days before departure. On arrival, they would undergo rapid testing for Covid-19 with the costs covered by the airlines. They will have to pay for their quarantine.  Vietnam has recorded 1,059 Covid-19 cases, 131 still active. A total 35 have succumbed to the disease, many being elderly patients suffering underlying conditions like diabetes or kidney failure.  The country has recorded no new local transmissions for a week."

The ministry said that workers will also receive compensation for rent, transportation, and food—based on seniority in the workplace—that could bump their monthly earnings to between U.S. $209 and $220 a month.  “The Ministry of Labor would like to thank Samdech Prime Minister [Hun Sen] who has maintained peace, stability, social order and reforms to be more competitive with neighboring nations, drawing investors and creating jobs to relieve the people and restore the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic,” the announcement said, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.  By contrast, contracted laborers in neighboring Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos earned a monthly minimum wage of U.S. $191, $182, and $88 in 2020, respectively.  Cambodia’s U.S. $10 billion apparel industry, which employs 900,000 workers, has seen mass layoffs and factory suspensions amid a slow in demand during the coronavirus pandemic.  The industry is also bracing for the impact from the EU’s withdrawal of duty-free, quota-free access to its market under the “Everything But Arms” (EBA) scheme for some 20 percent of Cambodia’s exports—a decision that was announced in February—which went into effect on Aug. 12.  The EU’s move came in response to the Hun Sen government’s failure to reverse rollbacks on democracy and other freedoms required under the trade arrangement.  The 20 percent EBA withdrawal is expected to have a significant impact on the economy in Cambodia, which exported U.S. $6.4 billion in goods, mostly from its garment sector, to the EU in 2018—accounting for 45 percent of Cambodia’s total exports that year.  Rather than acquiesce to EU demands, Hun Sen has doubled down, calling the requirements a challenge to Cambodian sovereignty and using allegations that his government allowed Vietnam to encroach on Cambodian territory as a pretext to arrest outspoken critics.  Seeking 'decent' wage  Ath Thun, president of the Cambodian Labor Confederation, told RFA’s Khmer Service on Thursday that the new U.S. $192 minimum wage fails to keep pace with inflation and said that in order for workers to survive, they need to earn at least U.S. $230-250 per month.  He said that the new minimum wage will put workers “in danger” because they will need to work overtime to make enough money to support themselves. He said that if the government will not increase the minimum wage, it must halt inflation so that workers can get by on low incomes.  “We want a decent minimum wage for all workers—not just garment factory workers—but the government was unwilling to do so,” he said.  Ath Thun said that because the government had already made its decision, unions and workers would have no choice but to abide by it, as they are likely to face arrest if they protest.  “The unions are not given the freedom they need to operate effectively,” he said.  “The workers will face problems if they protest to demand a minimum wage increase. It is hard to make any change to the minimum wage due to the current political situation.”  Among those arrested in recent weeks was Rong Chhun, president of the Cambodian Confederation of Unions (CCU), who was officially charged with “incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest” under Article 495 of Cambodia’s Penal Code and jailed at Prey Sar Prison in Phnom Penh on Aug 1 after he claimed the government has allowed Vietnam to encroach on Cambodian territory along their shared border. Since then, supporters have held near-daily protests demanding his release.  Prior to his arrest, Rong Chhun had criticized the government’s response to the coronavirus and, in July, wrote to Hun Sen calling on him to proactively address the issues that the EU has said prompted it to end Cambodia’s trade privileges.  'Not enough'  RFA was unable to reach Ken Loo, secretary general of the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia (GMAC), which represents factory owners, for comment on the government’s minimum wage decision Thursday.  In June, GMAC had urged Cambodia’s government to postpone annual negotiations on minimum wage, saying the sector needs to first recover from a dearth of orders from foreign buyers and factory shutdowns caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  Meanwhile, Mom Soksreymom, a worker from the W&D Garment Factory in the capital Phnom Penh, told RFA that each month she needs more than U.S. $200 just to cover her basic expenses, but also requires money for other things, in addition to sending funds home to her parents.  She said U.S. $192 is not enough to help workers maintain a decent living because the cost of daily goods is regularly increasing.  “I want the government to halt inflation, otherwise even if we are making U.S. $210-220, it still will not be enough,” she said.

""Right now, the demand of experts, businesses and investors to come to Vietnam for surveillance purposes is high,"" Mai Tien Dung, Chairman of the Government Office, said at a Thursday meeting regarding quarantine extensions for foreigners and Vietnamese entering the country.  He noted that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc's instruction calls for a step-by-step reopening of international flight routes, ensuring that the process is neither too lax nor too strict to hamper development opportunities.  Specifically, for about three days prior to getting on planes to fly to Vietnam, passengers would need to test negative for the novel coronavirus at their embarkation points.  After entering Vietnam, they would be quarantined in accommodations like hotels and resorts for a period deemed appropriate. During this quarantine period, they would be tested twice. If both test results are negative for the novel coronavirus, they would be allowed to self-monitor themselves at home. They would have to pay for the tests and quarantine fees.  People entering Vietnam after transiting through a third country would have to be quarantined in centralized facilities for 14 days.  The Government Office is expected to submit the proposal to the Prime Minister at a Friday meeting on Covid-19 prevention after consultations with ministries, businesses and tourism associations.  Dung also noted that once international flight routes are reopened, the influx of passengers entering Hanoi and HCMC would be high, so the two cities need to increase the number of quarantine accommodations and make sure that quarantine fees are transparent and made public. Accommodations will be requested to offer discounts, provide good services and take effective measures against the spread of the novel coronavirus.  Vietnam suspended international flights in late March.  After the country managed to bring the second outbreak of the pandemic under control, the Transport Ministry earlier this month proposed reopening flight routes to certain destinations in mainland China, Japan and South Korea starting September 15, followed by Laos, Cambodia and Taiwan starting September 22. The ministry estimates the number of arriving passengers to be quarantined per week at about 5,000 in Hanoi and HCMC.  Vietnam had earlier this month lifted the requirement of 14-day quarantine at centralized facilities for foreign experts, investors, managers, and diplomats entering the country for less than 14 days, but required them to comply with all Covid-19 prevention measures including wearing masks and refraining from shaking hands.  The country has recorded 1,059 Covid-19 cases so far, 128 of which are active. So far, 35 people have succumbed to the pandemic, many of them elderly patients with underlying conditions like diabetes and/or kidney failure.

Latin American and Caribbean nations will receive $1 billion in loans to buy the medicine. Bangladesh will get more than 100,000 free doses from a Chinese company.  Never mind that China is still most likely months away from mass-producing a vaccine that is safe for public use. The country is using the prospect of the drug’s discovery in a charm offensive aimed at repairing damaged ties and bringing friends closer in regions China deems vital to its interests.  Take, for example, Indonesia, which has long been wary of Beijing. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, assured the nation’s president, Joko Widodo, in a call last week: “China takes seriously Indonesia’s concerns and needs in vaccine cooperation.”  Read: Health official tries to reassure public that science will set Covid-19 vaccine approval  Xi hailed the two countries’ cooperation on developing a vaccine as “a new bright spot” in relations, according to a statement from China’s Foreign Ministry. “Together, China and Indonesia will continue to stand in solidarity against Covid-19,” he promised.  China’s vaccine pledges, on top of earlier shipments of masks and ventilators around the world, help it project itself as a responsible player as the United States retreats from global leadership. Beijing’s moves could also help it push back against accusations that the ruling Communist Party should be held responsible for its initial missteps when the coronavirus first emerged in China in December.  The ability to develop and deliver vaccines to poorer countries would also be a powerful signal of China’s rise as a scientific leader in a new post-pandemic global order.  “People are very willing to take a Chinese vaccine,” said Ghazala Parveen, a senior official at the National Institute of Health in Pakistan, where two Chinese vaccine-makers are conducting trials. “In fact, we are being asked by people to have the vaccine ready as soon as possible.”  By some measures, China is leading the global race for a Covid-19 vaccine. It has four candidates in the last phase of clinical trials, more than any other country.  Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine confidence volatile, vulnerable to misinformation, global study finds  The United States has three vaccine candidates in late-stage trials, with Pfizer saying it could apply for emergency approval as early as October and Moderna saying it hopes to have a vaccine by the end of the year. AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish company that received US government funding to develop its vaccine, paused its late-stage global trials this week because of a serious suspected adverse reaction in a participant.  China has approved at least two experimental vaccines under an emergency use program that started in July with soldiers and employees of state-owned companies and has quietly expanded to include health care and aviation workers. Its vaccine-makers have built factories that can produce hundreds of thousands of doses.  Xi has declared that China would make domestically developed vaccines a global public good, though his government has provided few details.  China has long viewed contributing to global health as an opportunity to build its soft power.  Also Read: WHO says $700 million raised so far for Covid-19 vaccines initiative for poor  “The government definitely would like to see that China is successful in producing a good vaccine and that many countries want it,” said Jennifer Huang Bouey, an epidemiologist and China expert at the RAND Corp. “It’s beneficial for its diplomacy and changing the narrative on Covid.”  But Chinese vaccine companies that have gone abroad to conduct clinical trials have generated controversy amid fears that local residents are being treated like guinea pigs. And with so much still unknown about the coronavirus, the vaccines could make it to the last stage of trials only to stumble.  Despite the uncertainty, Beijing has pushed its prospective vaccines with confidence and has used them to help smooth over frictions.  Last month, Premier Li Keqiang met with officials from Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to damp criticism that China had contributed to a devastating drought in the Southeast Asian nations. He also offered Chinese vaccines — a proposal that was well received.  In a speech during the same summit, Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, a staunch supporter of China, singled out Beijing for praise, saying he “would like to give a high appreciation of efforts of our friend China in producing a vaccine.”  In the Philippines, where China is competing with the United States for influence, President Rodrigo Duterte told lawmakers in July that he had “made a plea” to Xi for help with vaccines. He also said he would not confront China over its claims to the South China Sea.  Track live updates on coronavirus here  A day later, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, said China was willing to give the Philippines priority access to a vaccine.  Chinese leaders have made similar offers to countries in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South Asia — regions where Beijing has sought to expand its influence.  “We pledge that once the development and deployment of the Covid-19 vaccine is completed in China, African countries will be among the first to benefit,” Xi told a meeting of African leaders in June. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, promised in July that China would extend $1 billion in loans for vaccines to Latin American and Caribbean countries, according to the government of Mexico.  For all its talk of providing vaccines as a public good, China seems determined to do so only on its own terms. It has been reticent on whether it plans to join Covax, a World Health Organization-backed mechanism that aims to help countries distribute a coronavirus vaccine equitably. (The Trump administration has flat-out rejected the initiative.)  “In fact, we have already cooperated with some countries,” Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s Foreign Ministry, told reporters last week. “China always keeps its word.”  If China wins the race for a vaccine, it will owe its success to some of these countries, which have played an indispensable role by providing Chinese vaccine-makers with human test subjects.  Also Read: Will know Covid-19 vaccine results by year-end if trials resume: AstraZeneca  Chinese drugmakers have taken their research abroad because the outbreak at home has been under control for months.  In Bangladesh, Sinovac Biotech, a vaccine-maker based in Beijing, is testing its vaccine on 4,200 health care workers in Dhaka, the capital. The Chinese company has agreed to provide more than 110,000 free vaccine doses to the country, according to Dr. John Clemens, executive director of Bangladesh’s International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, which is helping conduct the trials.  That is a tiny fraction of the 170 million residents of Bangladesh, one of Asia’s poorest countries. And despite their participation in the Chinese clinical trials, Bangladeshis fear that the vaccines that result may be priced out of the reach of most of the country’s citizens.  “If any person in the world gets deprived of their right to a Covid-19 vaccine because of patent rights and profitability, this would be the biggest injustice in this century,” said Md. Sayedur Rahman, a professor of pharmacology at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University in Dhaka.  The Foreign Ministry in Beijing has emphasized that China will not seek to establish a monopoly on vaccine supply. State news media reports have also rejected accusations that China is using vaccines as a diplomatic tool, while government-backed academics assert that the provision of vaccines is altruistic.  “There will certainly be no strings attached,” said Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies. “Since it is going to be a global public good, adding any conditions would arouse suspicion from the other party.”  But China is already drawing concern in countries on the receiving end of its overtures as well as from regional powers that view Beijing as encroaching on their spheres of influence.  In Nepal, where China would like to conduct clinical trials on 500 workers in a cement company, politicians have raised questions about the safety of the vaccines and the lack of transparency.  Covid-19 Pandemic Tracker: 15 countries with the highest number of coronavirus cases, deaths  “Shouldn’t we be assured about its side effects?” Prakash Sharan Mahat, a former foreign minister of Nepal and a leader of the country’s main opposition party, Nepali Congress, said in an interview.  India, which is wary of Beijing’s intentions in South Asia, has responded to China’s offers of vaccines for Bangladesh and Nepal with its own pledges to provide its allies with vaccines.  Some countries may have few alternatives to China.  Indonesia has started a last-stage clinical trial for Sinovac on 1,620 volunteers and has signed an agreement with the Chinese company for 50 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine concentrate that would allow an Indonesian state-owned vaccine-maker, PT Bio Farma, to produce doses locally.  Some political experts in Indonesia worry about the leverage that China would wield over the country, but they acknowledge that Indonesia has little choice.  “Should we be suspicious, or should we be grateful?” asked Muhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat, an academic at Universitas Islam Indonesia, who researches China’s foreign policy in Indonesia. “I think both.”"

Former Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) on Health Dr Zafar Mirza told Dawn it was the recognition of Pakistan’s effort at the international level.  WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a media briefing said Pakistan deployed the infrastructure built up over many years for polio to combat Covid-19.  “Community health workers who have been trained to go door-to-door vaccinating children for polio have been utilised for surveillance, contact tracing and care,” he said.  “There are many other examples, including Cambodia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Senegal, Spain and Vietnam. Many of these countries have done well because they learned lessons from previous outbreaks of SARS, MERS, measles, polio, Ebola, flu and other diseases. That’s why it’s vital that we all learn lessons this pandemic is teaching us,” he said.  Asks international community to follow its example  Dr Mirza in a tweet stated: “Pakistan included among seven countries by WHO Director General- countries that the world can learn from about how to fight future pandemics. Great honour for the people of Pakistan. Alhamdolilah.”  Talking to Dawn, Dr Mirza said it was the recognition of the national effort internationally.  “It proves that if we want to do something we can do it. Moreover, the WHO DG spoke about the importance of the public health system. It is talked about ‘building back better (BBB)’ and I believe time has come to build back,” he said.  BBB is an approach to post-disaster recovery that reduces vulnerability to future disasters and builds community resilience to address physical, social, environmental, and economic vulnerabilities and shocks.  While there are rumours that Dr Mirza has left the country, he again said he is not going anywhere and will stay in Pakistan.  “I am not in a job mode anymore and just want to contribute for the awareness of the masses,” he said.  Ministry of National Health Services spokesperson Sajid Shah said it was collective efforts from the platform of National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) due to which not only Pakistan proved all international estimates regarding the number of cases wrong but also minimised the cases.  He said efforts were being made to further push back the virus.  While Pakistan has minimised the Covid-19 cases, in India around 4.5 million cases and 75,000 deaths have been reported. India is ranked second after the United States in which 6.5 million cases have been reported.  The virus was first detected in China in December 2019 and then it started spreading in other countries. Pakistan had closed its borders and took a number of steps to stop the transmission due to which the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the last week of February. On March 13, the first meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) was held to discuss the crisis which was later declared pandemic by WHO.  Prime Minister Imran Khan chaired the meeting of NSC and directed the concerned authorities to devise a comprehensive strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.  A lockdown was announced on March 16 and a number of industries, including the construction industry, educational institutions, restaurants, marriage halls etc were closed.  The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was involved to ensure medical equipment and health related supplies at the earliest due to which coordination with the provinces improved. Pakistan also sealed its western border with Afghanistan and Iran. Even Kartarpur shrine was closed for local people.  The construction industry was opened on August 7 and the National Coordination Committee (NCC) on Covid-19 lifted restrictions on the tourism sector from Aug 8 and on restaurants and transport sector from Aug 10.  Since the opening of tourist spots, a huge influx of tourists was observed without following SOPs due to which Gilgit-Baltistan had to close its tourist spots. However, a large number of people have been visiting other areas of the country, including Kumrat Valley, due to which it is feared that the second wave of the virus may arrive.

""Beginning on Jan. 1, 2021, garment and shoe factory workers will get U.S. $192 a month, while temporary workers will get U.S. $187 [until they become permanent workers],"" the ministry said in a statement.  The ministry said that workers will also receive compensation for rent, transportation, and food–based on seniority in the workplace–that could bump their monthly earnings to between U.S. $209 and $220 a month.  ""The Ministry of Labor would like to thank Samdech Prime Minister [Hun Sen] who has maintained peace, stability, social order and reforms to be more competitive with neighboring nations, drawing investors and creating jobs to relieve the people and restore the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the announcement said, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.  By contrast, contracted laborers in neighboring Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos earned a monthly minimum wage of U.S. $191, $182, and $88 in 2020, respectively.  Cambodia's U.S. $10 billion apparel industry, which employs 900,000 workers, has seen mass layoffs and factory suspensions amid a slow in demand during the coronavirus pandemic.  The industry is also bracing for the impact from the EU's withdrawal of duty-free, quota-free access to its market under the ""Everything But Arms"" (EBA) scheme for some 20 percent of Cambodia's exports–a decision that was announced in February–which went into effect on Aug. 12.  The EU's move came in response to the Hun Sen government's failure to reverse rollbacks on democracy and other freedoms required under the trade arrangement.  The 20 percent EBA withdrawal is expected to have a significant impact on the economy in Cambodia, which exported U.S. $6.4 billion in goods, mostly from its garment sector, to the EU in 2018–accounting for 45 percent of Cambodia's total exports that year.  Rather than acquiesce to EU demands, Hun Sen has doubled down, calling the requirements a challenge to Cambodian sovereignty and using allegations that his government allowed Vietnam to encroach on Cambodian territory as a pretext to arrest outspoken critics.  Seeking 'decent' wage  Ath Thun, president of the Cambodian Labor Confederation, told RFA's Khmer Service on Thursday that the new U.S. $192 minimum wage fails to keep pace with inflation and said that in order for workers to survive, they need to earn at least U.S. $230-250 per month.  He said that the new minimum wage will put workers ""in danger"" because they will need to work overtime to make enough money to support themselves. He said that if the government will not increase the minimum wage, it must halt inflation so that workers can get by on low incomes.  ""We want a decent minimum wage for all workers–not just garment factory workers–but the government was unwilling to do so,"" he said.  Ath Thun said that because the government had already made its decision, unions and workers would have no choice but to abide by it, as they are likely to face arrest if they protest.  ""The unions are not given the freedom they need to operate effectively,"" he said.  ""The workers will face problems if they protest to demand a minimum wage increase. It is hard to make any change to the minimum wage due to the current political situation.""  Among those arrested in recent weeks was Rong Chhun, president of the Cambodian Confederation of Unions (CCU), who was officially charged with ""incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest"" under Article 495 of Cambodia's Penal Code and jailed at Prey Sar Prison in Phnom Penh on Aug 1 after he claimed the government has allowed Vietnam to encroach on Cambodian territory along their shared border. Since then, supporters have held near-daily protests demanding his release.  Prior to his arrest, Rong Chhun had criticized the government's response to the coronavirus and, in July, wrote to Hun Sen calling on him to proactively address the issues that the EU has said prompted it to end Cambodia's trade privileges.  'Not enough'  RFA was unable to reach Ken Loo, secretary general of the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia (GMAC), which represents factory owners, for comment on the government's minimum wage decision Thursday.  In June, GMAC had urged Cambodia's government to postpone annual negotiations on minimum wage, saying the sector needs to first recover from a dearth of orders from foreign buyers and factory shutdowns caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  Meanwhile, Mom Soksreymom, a worker from the W&D Garment Factory in the capital Phnom Penh, told RFA that each month she needs more than U.S. $200 just to cover her basic expenses, but also requires money for other things, in addition to sending funds home to her parents.  She said U.S. $192 is not enough to help workers maintain a decent living because the cost of daily goods is regularly increasing.  ""I want the government to halt inflation, otherwise even if we are making U.S. $210-220, it still will not be enough,"" she said.  Reported by RFA's Khmer Service. Translated by Samean Yun.

Vice President Mike Pence and presidential candidate Joe Biden attended a memorial this morning at Ground Zero for the nearly 3,000 Americans who were murdered that day. The Times notes that there were no speeches at the memorial, a consequence of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that has killed 23,000 people in New York City.  500,000 Oregonians are under evacuation orders as wildfires sweep the state, reports The Washington Post. In the past few days, rapid-moving fires have incinerated more than 900,000 acres in Oregon and killed at least four people. Governor Kate Brown described the past week as “the greatest loss of human lives and property due to wildfires in our state’s history,” and her state will soon receive federal aid for temporary housing. California is watching its own catastrophic fires cloud the skies with orange smoke, showing many residents that “climate change is here and is changing our lives.”  A massive fire also blazed in Beirut, Lebanon this morning, the same city where a chemical explosion killed 190 people last month, notes BBC News. Although no injuries were reported from the fire, analysts note that a warehouse of food parcels and cooking oil for humanitarian aid was destroyed.  Federal judges held yesterday that President Trump cannot exclude undocumented people from the census count, according to Buzzfeed News. To the three circuit judges on the panel, the fact that the president had violated federal law was “not particularly close or complicated,” because the Census Act requires the Commerce Secretary to give a total count of people living in the U.S.  Buzzfeed News also reports the 11th Circuit’s en banc ruling that Florida can require felons to pay all outstanding fines and fees before being allowed to vote. A group of people convicted of felonies had sued on the grounds that the requirement violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because many of them cannot afford to pay the fines.  An adviser appointed by Judge Emmet Sullivan to consider aspects of the case involving General Michael Flynn has urged Judge Sullivan to deny the Justice Department’s request to drop the case, reports Kyle Cheney of Politico. The adviser released a thirty-page statement today, writing that “there is clear evidence that [the] motion [from the Justice Department to drop the case] reflects a corrupt and politically unmotivated favor unworthy of our justice system.” The adviser argues that Flynn is clearly guilty, and he urges Judge Sullivan to move forward with sentencing.  Ethnic Tibetans living in Ladakh, an Indian-controlled region in Kashmir, are helping Indian soldiers in a border dispute with China, writes The South China Morning Post. The two countries accused each other this week of firing shots along the Line of Actual Control, an ill-defined border that ranges from the mountains of Ladakh to forests in the Eastern Himalayas. The Post tells of one family, the Dorjays, who fled Tibet after the Chinese invasion in 1950 and are now transporting supplies to Indian soldiers.  China is unleashing a “charm offensive” to help out neighbors such as Cambodia and the Philippines with their respective pandemic responses, writes The New York Times. China has pledged to distribute a future Covid-19 vaccine to the countries, as well as its international shipments of masks and ventilators. The Times notes that these moves will “help it project itself as a responsible player as the United States retreats from global leadership.”  The European Union is preparing to sanction Turkey for its aggression in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, according to Deutsche Welle. Member states Greece and Cyprus assert that a potentially oil-laden area of the sea lies within their exclusive economic zones; to Turkish President Reccip Erdogan, his neighbors have stolen an unfair share of maritime resources, and he has countered by sending warships and natural gas exploration vessels into the region.  Formal peace talks between Afghanistan and the Taliban will begin soon, reports The Washington Post. The warming of relations comes after the Afghan government released five high-value Taliban prisoners and flew them to Qatar. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will also travel to Qatar for the talks, with the Trump administration hoping that the negotiations will lead to further withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

Latin American and Caribbean nations will receive $1 billion in loans to buy the medicine. Bangladesh will get more than 100,000 free doses from a Chinese company.Never mind that China is still most likely months away from mass-producing a vaccine that is safe for public use. The country is using the prospect of the drug’s discovery in a charm offensive aimed at repairing damaged ties and bringing friends closer in regions China deems vital to its interests.Take, for example, Indonesia, which has long been wary of Beijing. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, assured the nation’s president, Joko Widodo, in a call last week: “China takes seriously Indonesia’s concerns and needs in vaccine cooperation.”Xi hailed the two countries’ cooperation on developing a vaccine as “a new bright spot” in relations, according to a statement from China’s Foreign Ministry. “Together, China and Indonesia will continue to stand in solidarity against COVID-19,” he promised.China’s vaccine pledges, on top of earlier shipments of masks and ventilators around the world, help it project itself as a responsible player as the United States retreats from global leadership. Beijing’s moves could also help it push back against accusations that the ruling Communist Party should be held responsible for its initial missteps when the coronavirus first emerged in China in December.The ability to develop and deliver vaccines to poorer countries would also be a powerful signal of China’s rise as a scientific leader in a new post-pandemic global order.“People are very willing to take a Chinese vaccine,” said Ghazala Parveen, a senior official at the National Institute of Health in Pakistan, where two Chinese vaccine-makers are conducting trials. “In fact, we are being asked by people to have the vaccine ready as soon as possible.”By some measures, China is leading the global race for a COVID-19 vaccine. It has four candidates in the last phase of clinical trials, more than any other country.The United States has three vaccine candidates in late-stage trials, with Pfizer saying it could apply for emergency approval as early as October and Moderna saying it hopes to have a vaccine by the end of the year. AstraZeneca , a British-Swedish company that received U.S. government funding to develop its vaccine, paused its late-stage global trials this week because of a serious suspected adverse reaction in a participant.China has approved at least two experimental vaccines under an emergency use program that started in July with soldiers and employees of state-owned companies and has quietly expanded to include health care and aviation workers. Its vaccine-makers have built factories that can produce hundreds of thousands of doses.Xi has declared that China would make domestically developed vaccines a global public good, though his government has provided few details.China has long viewed contributing to global health as an opportunity to build its soft power.“The government definitely would like to see that China is successful in producing a good vaccine and that many countries want it,” said Jennifer Huang Bouey, an epidemiologist and China expert at the RAND Corp. “It’s beneficial for its diplomacy and changing the narrative on COVID.”But Chinese vaccine companies that have gone abroad to conduct clinical trials have generated controversy amid fears that local residents are being treated like guinea pigs. And with so much still unknown about the coronavirus, the vaccines could make it to the last stage of trials only to stumble.Despite the uncertainty, Beijing has pushed its prospective vaccines with confidence and has used them to help smooth over frictions.Last month, Premier Li Keqiang met with officials from Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to damp criticism that China had contributed to a devastating drought in the Southeast Asian nations. He also offered Chinese vaccines — a proposal that was well received.In a speech during the same summit, Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, a staunch supporter of China, singled out Beijing for praise, saying he “would like to give a high appreciation of efforts of our friend China in producing a vaccine.”In the Philippines, where China is competing with the United States for influence, President Rodrigo Duterte told lawmakers in July that he had “made a plea” to Xi for help with vaccines. He also said he would not confront China over its claims to the South China Sea A day later, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, said China was willing to give the Philippines priority access to a vaccine.Chinese leaders have made similar offers to countries in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South Asia — regions where Beijing has sought to expand its influence.“We pledge that once the development and deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine is completed in China, African countries will be among the first to benefit,” Xi told a meeting of African leaders in June. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, promised in July that China would extend $1 billion in loans for vaccines to Latin American and Caribbean countries, according to the government of Mexico For all its talk of providing vaccines as a public good, China seems determined to do so only on its own terms. It has been reticent on whether it plans to join Covax, a World Health Organization-backed mechanism that aims to help countries distribute a coronavirus vaccine equitably. (The Trump administration has flat-out rejected the initiative.)“In fact, we have already cooperated with some countries,” Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s Foreign Ministry, told reporters last week. “China always keeps its word.”If China wins the race for a vaccine, it will owe its success to some of these countries, which have played an indispensable role by providing Chinese vaccine-makers with human test subjects.Chinese drugmakers have taken their research abroad because the outbreak at home has been under control for months.In Bangladesh, Sinovac Biotech, a vaccine-maker based in Beijing, is testing its vaccine on 4,200 health care workers in Dhaka, the capital. The Chinese company has agreed to provide more than 110,000 free vaccine doses to the country, according to Dr. John Clemens, executive director of Bangladesh’s International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, which is helping conduct the trials.That is a tiny fraction of the 170 million residents of Bangladesh, one of Asia’s poorest countries. And despite their participation in the Chinese clinical trials, Bangladeshis fear that the vaccines that result may be priced out of the reach of most of the country’s citizens.“If any person in the world gets deprived of their right to a COVID-19 vaccine because of patent rights and profitability, this would be the biggest injustice in this century,” said Md. Sayedur Rahman, a professor of pharmacology at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University in Dhaka.The Foreign Ministry in Beijing has emphasized that China will not seek to establish a monopoly on vaccine supply. State news media reports have also rejected accusations that China is using vaccines as a diplomatic tool, while government-backed academics assert that the provision of vaccines is altruistic.“There will certainly be no strings attached,” said Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies . “Since it is going to be a global public good, adding any conditions would arouse suspicion from the other party.”But China is already drawing concern in countries on the receiving end of its overtures as well as from regional powers that view Beijing as encroaching on their spheres of influence.In Nepal, where China would like to conduct clinical trials on 500 workers in a cement company, politicians have raised questions about the safety of the vaccines and the lack of transparency.“Shouldn’t we be assured about its side effects?” Prakash Sharan Mahat, a former foreign minister of Nepal and a leader of the country’s main opposition party, Nepali Congress, said in an interview.India, which is wary of Beijing’s intentions in South Asia, has responded to China’s offers of vaccines for Bangladesh and Nepal with its own pledges to provide its allies with vaccines.Some countries may have few alternatives to China.Indonesia has started a last-stage clinical trial for Sinovac on 1,620 volunteers and has signed an agreement with the Chinese company for 50 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine concentrate that would allow an Indonesian state-owned vaccine-maker, PT Bio Farma, to produce doses locally.Some political experts in Indonesia worry about the leverage that China would wield over the country, but they acknowledge that Indonesia has little choice.“Should we be suspicious, or should we be grateful?” asked Muhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat, an academic at Universitas Islam Indonesia, who researches China’s foreign policy in Indonesia. “I think both.”"

Berli Jucker Plc (BJC), the SET-listed consumer goods maker and the owner of Big C Supercenter, remains committed to ramping up its retail business despite the pandemic.  The company says the retail business generates cash faster than other businesses and has unlimited growth opportunity in Thailand's 3.6-trillion-baht retail market, as long as it relies on its own distribution channels.  ""We shifted our focus to downstream a few years ago and look set to increase our effort in this business later this year,"" said Aswin Techajareonvikul, BJC's chief executive.  In 2019, BJC reported total revenue of 174 billion baht and a net profit of 7.27 billion baht.  The company is engaged in the modern retail supply chain, operating modern retail stores and online stores; in the packaging supply chain, manufacturing, marketing and distributing packaging products, including glass containers, aluminium cans and rigid plastic containers; in the consumer supply chain, manufacturing, marketing and distributing consumer goods in food and personal care; and in the healthcare and technical supply chain, distributing products and services related to pharmaceuticals and pharmaceuticals.  BJC also operates other business units, such as retail in Southeast Asia, and is interested in mergers, acquisitions and new business development.  Mr Aswin acknowledged that the company put its retail expansion on hold temporarily during the coronavirus outbreak because it was unsure whether the situation would recover in the third quarter.  ""With a better situation, we will resume investment with the same budget allocation of 10 billion baht, the majority of which will be slated for retail business expansion,"" he said.  The company plans to open two new hypermarkets, two Food Place branches and 240 Mini Big C stores this year.  In the first half of the year, the company opened 46 new Mini Big C outlets and four new Big C Depots, which are wholesale stores focusing on business clients.  Each Big C Depot contains a Mini Big C store under the same roof. There are five Big C Depot stores: two in Nakhon Ratchasima and one each in Buri Ram, Kalasin and Nakhon Sawan provinces.  ""The Big C Depot format is still in a testing period, and initial results have been encouraging,"" said Mr Aswin, who was instrumental in expanding BJC into retail business in 2008.  Once Mr Aswin started working for BJC as its president, he set up TCC Logistics & Warehouse Co to open the first MM Mega Market, a wholesale and retail store format, in Nong Khai province in 2014. A second branch opened shortly after in Sa Kaeo.  BJC acquired 19 Metro stores in Vietnam in 2015 and renamed them MM Mega Market.  The company also opened B's Mart convenience stores in Vietnam in 2013. It now operates 109 B's Marts in Ho Chi Minh City.  ""We opened the 20th MM Mega Market in Hanoi a few months ago,"" Mr Aswin said. ""We will still use Vietnam as a springboard to expand MM Mega Market in Indochina within the next 2-3 years.""  Stores in Laos, Cambodia and southern China are in the pipeline.  According to Mr Aswin, there is ample opportunity to open more MM Mega Markets in Vietnam, due to less competition than in other retail categories. MM Mega Market is a wholesale concept store, serving customers in the HoReCa (hotel, restaurant, catering) segment.  As of the second half of 2020, BJC operates 1,448 retail stores under various brands and formats, including Big C, B's Mart, MM Mega Market, Asia Books, Food Place, Pure and Depot, covering hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores, wholesale centres, bookstores and drugstores.  ""With consumers shifting to shop more at smaller retail stores near their homes during the pandemic, we are gearing towards this trend,"" Mr Aswin said, adding that the highlighted formats to open in the future are Food Place, Mini Big C and MM Mega Market.  In addition to an active expansion into new retail formats, the company vows to forge as many partnerships as possible to develop other necessary items in the future to cover wider product categories.  ""We're open for partners in all business sizes to help co-develop new products under our own brands or theirs,"" Mr Aswin said. ""Under this partnership scheme, we are willing to hold less than a 25% stake in the joint ventures. However, it depends on the potential partners' technology or our purpose of collaboration.""  In the past, BJC took a majority or controlling stake as part of any joint venture deal.  BJC reported that sales in the first half fell by 5.4% to 74.6 billion baht, with a net profit of 2.08 billion baht, down 47.7% from the same period last year.  The company gradually saw sales recover after state-imposed restrictions were eased.  According to Mr Aswin, the company's sales after Covid-19 will stem largely from products with greater markets. The company plans to dial back non-performing items and broaden the product assortment with bigger package sizes to support the new normal, such as work-from-home and cook-at-home lifestyles.  The company has also adjusted the frequency of deliveries from suppliers to its distribution centres and from its distribution centres to stores; diversified delivery options with drive-through service and home delivery; and increased cross-merchandising and cross-format promotions.  ""As a matter of fact, the Covid-19 outbreak not only dealt a heavy blow to our business, but it also created new business opportunities,"" Mr Aswin said. ""We've seen many initiatives from our leaders and their dedications. Lessons from the outbreak have prompted BJC to become better and more ready to cope with any disruptions in the future, including a possible second wave of Covid-19.  ""The outbreak caused BJC to speed up changes. Several things were implemented within only 4-5 months during the pandemic, from an earlier plan to do them in the next 4-5 months."""

Coronavirus cases have spiked in Myanmar this month just as campaigning opened for nationwide elections, forcing political parties to deal with restrictions on rallies, stay-at-home-orders, and quarantines in the two-month race for votes on Nov. 8.  Like continental Southeast Asian neighbors Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, Myanmar largely avoided widespread COVID-19 infections that spread around the globe through the first half of the year.  But Myanmar has seen a deadly return of the virus since mid-August, with spikes in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in populous areas and conflict zones, prompting health and election authorities to impose social-distancing rules.  The Ministry of Health and Sports announced Sunday that campaign gatherings would be restricted to 50 people who must remain six feet apart, wear face masks, and have access to hand sanitizer.  The Union Election Commission (UEC) issued guidelines for political parties and candidates — suspending door-to-door campaigning and rallies in open areas and buildings in places where the government has issued stay-at-home orders. Local  governments require candidates who visit their districts to undergo quarantines.  As of Thursday, Myanmar registered 2,150 confirmed COVID-19 cases amid the resurgence of the highly contagious respiratory illness, adding 261 new cases overnight. The country has had 14 coronavirus-related fatalities.  About 37.5 million voters in Myanmar’s population of 54 million are eligible to cast ballots in the Nov. 8 elections. Nearly 7,000 candidates from more than 90 parties or who are independents are vying for 1,171 seats available in both houses of the national parliament and in state and regional legislatures.  Campaigning is complicated by long-running wars in big states, such as Kachin and Shan, where swathes of territory are controlled by ethnic armies that restrict or ban voting.  In western Rakhine state, a 21-month-old war has forced 200,000 rural villagers to take refuge in overcrowded shelters and hampered efforts to deal with what is now Myanmar’s worst coronavirus hot spot.  USDP to file complaint  On Monday, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who also chairs the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party, canceled her first campaign stop in Yangon’s Kawhmu township — her current parliamentary constituency — after a staff member tested positive for the virus, and others in contact with the person were quarantined.  “We have negotiated with the Health Ministry over election campaigning trips,” she told participants in an online forum. “I decided not to go to Kawhmu township for campaigning because we need to follow the Health Ministry’s orders when virus infections are on the rise.”  But the NLD held campaign events in Myanmar’s capital Naypyidaw in which hundreds of people were involved in excess of the Health Ministry’s 50-person cap on gatherings, according to an official from the opposition Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP).  USDP chairman Than Htay told reporters on Wednesday that he would file a complaint with the ministry about the NLD’s failure to adhere to coronavirus restrictions.  “Yesterday, I visited two villages in Zeyar Thiri township in Naypyidaw, [and] I saw NLD party members campaigning with hundreds of people,” he said. “This is a blatant violation of COVID-19 restrictions.”  “I will send an official compliant letter to the ministry today,” he added.  A supporter of the National League for Democracy party stands near Union Solidarity and Development Party members as they campaign for the upcoming general elections in Myanmar's commercial hub Yangon, Sept.9, 2020. Credit: AFP  Political parties and candidates in northern Rakhine state, the current epicenter of a coronavirus surge in Myanmar, also began campaigning Tuesday, though efforts to get their messages to voters are being hampered by COVID-19-related restrictions on activities and by the armed conflict between government forces and the Arakan Army.  Health Ministry officials have put in place stay-at-home orders in all 17 townships in Rakhine, some of which are also affected by government-imposed internet service blackouts aimed at stifling rebel communications. The suspension of service has placed further limitations on campaign activities, members of political parties said.  Tun Aung Kyaw, a political steering committee member of the Arakan National Party (ANP), Rakhine state’s predominant party which represents the interests of ethnic Rakhine people, said ANP candidates cannot do any campaigning at all.  “The UEC said we can have gatherings of up to 50 people, but regional orders contradict this permission,” he said.  “We have many challenges,” he added. “We have registered our candidates to contest in the election, [so] we will try our best to campaign for the election.”  Pe Than, an ANP lawmaker who represents the Myebon township constituency and is running for reelection, said he and other candidates can’t do much given township stay-at-home orders and the ongoing hostilities in northern Rakhine state.  “Both circumstances are making election campaigning impossible,” he said. “The UEC hasn’t yet announced the townships that will not be able to hold elections, so we don’t know what to do. We just have to wait and see.”  The Health Ministry also ordered lockdowns in all but one of 44 townships in Yangon region, home to 7.6 million people and Myanmar’s largest city, where the number of COVID-19 cases also has spiked.  Small, minority parties at a loss  Many candidates from small and ethnic-minority based parties say the virus restrictions will hinder their ability to compete, while some have suggested that the elections should be postponed.  “The best we can do is go around the city in vehicles carrying a sound box playing campaign music and slogans,” said Ko Ko Gyi, chairman of the People’s Party, at the party’s campaign launch event on Tuesday. “Even for that, we now need permission from the Health Ministry.”  “Regardless of the rules and regulations, they are very difficult to strictly follow on the ground,” he added.  David Hla Myint, the chairman of the relatively new United Nationalities Democracy Party (UNDP) who is running against Aung San Suu Kyi for the Kawhmu township parliamentary seat, told local media on Thursday that the well-established parties will have an edge in campaigning.  “The established parties can do various campaign activities despite the restrictions,” he said. “We will not have equal opportunities if we hold this election under these conditions.”  “It would be best to postpone the election,” he said.  Candidates from southeastern Myanmar’s Mon state also said they are finding it difficult to do election-related activities because of the increasing number of COVID-19 infections and tighter Health Ministry restrictions.  “Now, everyone is cautious as the pandemic is getting worse,” said Aung Naing Oo from the Mon Unity Party who is the deputy speaker of the state parliament. “We are also working around-the-clock not to break the rules issued by the Health Ministry.”  Reported by RFA’s Myanmar Service.

Around 20,000 passengers are scheduled to arrive in the country each month, Government Office Chief Mai Tien Dung said at a meeting Friday.  Passengers would include Vietnamese citizens, foreigners carrying diplomatic and official passports, experts, managers, high-skilled workers, investors, and their family members. The flights are not opened to tourists yet.  Under the Transport Ministry's proposal, there would be two weekly round trips on the HCMC-Guangzhou route, two weekly services on the Hanoi-Tokyo and HCMC-Tokyo routes as well as four trips from Hanoi and HCMC to Seoul, and four weekly trips to Taipei.  Dung said passengers must furnish a certificate showing they tested negative for the novel coronavirus within five days before boarding the flight. Upon landing in Vietnam, they would have to undergo centralized quarantine from five to seven days and would be tested for Covid-19 twice using the real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  Those reporting negative results would remain at home or their place of work until they complete the 14-day quarantine period as per health ministry protocol under supervision of local authorities. Those showing signs of infection will have to continue the centralized quarantine.  Since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out in Vietnam last January, the country required those coming from abroad to be quarantined at centralized facilities for 14 days.  Foreign passengers, including Vietnamese returning from abroad would have to pay for all quarantine and testing expenses. Costs for PCR testing in Vietnam are proposed at VND 1.2 million ($52) per person.  During their stay, passengers will be required to install Bluezone, a Bluetooth-based app that helps determine if a person has come into close contact with a Covid-19 patient.  At the meeting, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said Vietnam had brought the second outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic under control since the country has experienced eight clean days without new domestic infections.  ""It must be ensured that foreign arrivals cause no new outbreaks,"" Phuc stressed.  Vietnam suspended all international flights on March 25. Many foreigners who have been kept out of the country due to travel restrictions have pleaded with the government to reopen the borders and resume international flights so they could reunite with their families.  The country has recorded 1,059 Covid-19 cases, 128 of which remain active. So far, 35 people have succumbed to the pandemic, many of them elderly patients suffering underlying conditions like diabetes and/or kidney failure."

The 53-year-old recruitment agent from Pangbourne in Berkshire, southeast England, was due to catch a flight to Innsbruck in Austria for a three-day “boys’ holiday” skiing in the Tirolean Alps.  Jackson’s wife, Carol, felt Ischgl, the resort booked by the group, was a bit too close to the parts of northern Italy that had recently been shut down to contain the spread of a mystery flu-like illness. But Jackson threw caution to the wind: he had already spent more than £1,000 (€1,100) on the trip.  Ischgl, one of the most popular ski resorts in Europe, is what Jackson calls “a boyish kind of place”. He and his friends had been visiting the town in the Paznaun valley, Austria, for the past nine years. The snow is reliably powdery from November to May. The compact nature of the place means you don’t need a car to get around. The facilities are well-run: Ischgl has 45 state-of-the-art ski lifts, three of which take you directly from the edge of town to the mountain.  Then there are the many apres-ski bars, where Jackson and other tourists party after a hard day on the slopes. “They are a bit like discos for teenagers, but full of men in their 50s,” he says.  On March 4th, after their first day’s skiing, his group of eight friends headed to a wooden-clad hut on the eastern side of town called Niki’s Stadl, after its hard-partying late owner Niki Ganahl, a former skier on the Austrian national team turned musician who died of a heart attack in 2015, aged 58.  Beer and Jägermeister shots are around half the price they are across the border in Switzerland, and in Niki’s Stadl they flow freely from 3pm until the early hours (the bar stays open until the last punter leaves).  From a booth in the middle of the bar a DJ plays the local flavour of schlager pop, an unforgiving stream of four-to-the-floor beats laced with three-syllable choruses as deliberately dumb as they are easy to sing along to: “Oh Le Le”, “Blah Blah Blah” or “Saufi Saufi” (“Boozy Boozy”). Sometimes the entire dancefloor forms a conga and tramps to the bar across the road.  Blurry memory  When we speak four months later Jackson can’t get one blurry memory from that night out of his mind. “They have this massive red button next to the DJ booth, like something out of a TV quiz show. When you press it the music goes slightly quieter for 20 seconds and a siren goes off. My mate Declan got obsessed with pressing that button. He was a bit drunk and it became this game where we all had to. We must have pressed it 50 times that night. You had to push it with the palm of your hand and by the end of the night the button was slippery with sweat.”  Three days after returning home on March 7th, Jackson developed a pain in his back and joints, and lost his sense of taste. For the next four weeks he felt utterly exhausted and was unable to work, often going to bed in the afternoon. Months later an antibody test confirmed that he had had Covid-19.  “The virus didn’t kill me, but it made me feel unwell for a very long time,” he says.  Jackson was one of the lucky ones.  At least 28 people who visited Ischgl in late February and early March died of Covid-19. Four of the eight men in Jackson’s group fell ill with the virus on their return. Many thousands more are thought to have caught it at the resort.  By mid-March it was clear that tourists travelling in and out of the Paznaun valley had been the key accelerators behind the first wave of the virus on the European continent.  Covid-19, the “viral pneumonia of unknown cause” that Chinese officials first reported in Wuhan on January 3rd, has transformed our way of life, upended geopolitics and precipitated an economic crisis of historic proportions.  It has also revealed a strain of puritanism among people who thought themselves tolerant liberals: because the virus thrives in social situations nothing has enraged us more during lockdown than seeing people having fun in large numbers.  Anger  In Europe nowhere has drawn more of this anger than Ischgl, dubbed “Ibiza on ice”. Outbreaks in northern Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland have all been traced back to skiers returning home from the Paznaun valley, and the devastating reach of the Ischgl cluster is likely to be considerably wider: an Austrian lawyer compiling a class action lawsuit against the Tirol region, alleging it failed in its public health duties, has gathered the signatures of more than 6,000 tourists from 47 countries who believe they caught the virus in Ischgl, including people from Ireland, the UK, Canada, Cambodia and Zimbabwe.  In Germany, which supplies Ischgl with most of its guests, the outbreak has been the subject of a diplomatic war of words between Austrian and German politicians, who accuse each other of negligence, as well as numerous front pages.  Fear of being branded the “next Ischgl” helped to enforce lockdowns across central Europe, such is the stigma attached to the resort’s name.  Meanwhile, business owners in Ischgl say they have been scapegoated and that reports of orgiastic scenes are gross exaggerations. (Writing in the Daily Mail, columnist Jan Moir condemned skiers who had reportedly been playing a variation of beer pong, in which you spit a ball into a beer glass, with several players using the same ball. But none of the people I interviewed for this article can recall such a drinking game.) To an extent the people who work in Ischgl have a point. The focus on a frantic party scene has helped to distract from bigger decisions taken – or not taken – behind the scenes, the missed warnings and a key question: did the authorities prioritise economic factors over the health of residents and visitors?  On March 4th, Jackson and his friends had already stumbled out of Niki’s Stadl and gone to bed when an email arrived at the nearby hotel Nevada. Delivered at 11.45pm, it came from an Icelandic tourist who informed the management that she and two family members who had stayed at the hotel the previous week had tested positive for Covid-19 on their return to Reykjavik.  The woman added that she did not know if she had already been infectious in Ischgl, and that it was possible that she caught the virus on the journey home. Her airline had told her that her group flew on the same plane as an infected man who had been skiing in Italy.  The woman had been with three groups of Icelandic tourists, 25 people in all, who knew each other and were staying across two hotels and a set of apartments, from February 22nd-29th. Several were doctors, so the group had been following the news about the novel coronavirus more closely than other tourists.  Symptoms  After one of the Icelandic tourists developed symptoms on February 26th, and another began to feel unwell on the flight home, the group was on high alert. Haraldur Eyvinds Thrastarson, an IT manager who was concerned about infecting 600-plus colleagues, had a test after returning to Reykjavik.  “In Iceland we allowed the doctors to take over from politicians for a few weeks,” he says. “That really made the difference.”  Iceland started offering Covid-19 tests at the end of January, carrying them out on those with and without symptoms in the months that followed, giving it the highest per capita testing rate at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak.  By the evening of March 3rd, Thrastarson was confirmed as one of an eventual 16 positive cases among the group. Shortly before midnight on March 4th, Iceland’s top health authority sent a message to its counterpart in Vienna via the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS), a web-based platform linking public health authorities across the EU.  On the morning of March 5th, Iceland declared Ischgl a high-risk destination, in the same category as Wuhan and Iran. The same day an emergency meeting of a corona crisis task force was called in Ischgl for 1pm, with the Icelandic cases to be discussed at a meeting of health authorities for the Tirol region.  Yet when the Tirol’s public health officer sent out a press release later that day, it was not to put the region on high alert, but to call off a panic. In the statement, which is still online, the state medical director, Franz Katzgraber, said it was probable that the Icelandic tourists had caught the virus on the plane from Munich to Reykjavik: “From a medical perspective it seems not very likely that infections took place in Tirol.”  The response of an entire region now leaned precariously on a final half-sentence in the Icelandic tourist’s email – the suggestion that she might have caught Covid-19 from an Italian skier.  On Saturday, March 7th, Jackson and his friends checked out of their hotel. Staff cleaned their rooms, changed the bedding and checked in guests for another week.  Party destination  Ischgl is not just a party destination; it’s a party destination catering for people with money. There are designer boutiques and five- and four-star hotels, restaurants selling wagyu beef burgers and bottles of champagne at €600. In the streets posters advertise Top Of The Mountain concerts with A-list stars such as Rihanna and Elton John.  Every third euro earned in the Tirol comes directly or indirectly from tourism, predominantly visitors from Germany and Italy, who spend around €8.4 billion there every year.  On March 9th an Austrian news agency announced that 15 people who had been in contact with a Kitzloch barman in Ischgl had tested positive. Photograph: AFP via Getty Images  Smooth transit links are a big part of the appeal, and this efficient turnaround of visitors contributes to Ischgl’s profitability compared with other resorts: an airport-style travelator shuttles tourists through a tunnel from one side of town to the other. But the key economic driver is the ski lifts, used by 17 million people every year.  “We are the cable car company with the highest turnover in Austria, by some distance,” says Alexander von der Thannen (49), who heads the Ischgl Paznaun Tourist Association. “Our cable car makes over €80 million – the next one after that is Kitzbühel with €60 million.” (In the curtailed 2019/20 season the cable car company still had a turnover of €58.5 million.)  Typically of local businessmen, Von der Thannen has several jobs: he is also the Tirolean Chamber for Commerce spokesman on tourism, managing director of the five-star Trofana Royal hotel and owns an apres-ski bar Trofana Alm.  People who come to Ischgl, Von der Thannen says, “don’t just ski, they also consume”.  He believes that Europe has pointed the finger at Ischgl partly through resentment at its commercial success.  “Maybe what we are seeing is also the culture of envy: we are too big, we grew too fast. We’ve polarised opinion, deliberately so. We brought megastars to Ischgl – like Robbie Williams, Katy Perry, Tina Turner, Rod Stewart – who performed concerts on the top of the mountain. Maybe not everyone liked seeing that.”  But by the start of the second week of March, the fear that mishandling an outbreak of the virus could permanently damage the town’s reputation was at the forefront of the minds of senior officials and businessmen in Ischgl.  On Saturday, March 7th, the resort’s changeover day, a 36-year-old Norwegian became the first person to test positive for Covid-19 in the town itself, after experiencing light symptoms and a headache. He worked as a barman at Kitzloch, opposite Niki’s Stadl, where the Icelanders had also spent two evenings.  “There was speculation that he had just come back from a holiday in Italy,” says Bernhard Zangerl, Kitzloch’s manager. “That wasn’t true. He was here throughout.”  The inside of the bar was immediately disinfected, and 22 of the barman’s close contacts were told to self-isolate.  A mountain panorama in Ischgl.  Tested positive  Yet, on the Sunday, Tirol health authorities insisted it was “unlikely, from a medical perspective”, that the virus could have been transferred from staff to tourists.  At 3.53pm on Monday, March 9th, an Austrian news agency announced that 15 people who had been in contact with the Kitzloch barman had also tested positive.  Seven minutes later, Zangerl’s father, Peter, who owns Kitzloch, got a text message: “Dear Peter,” it read. “Please call me back or shut down your Kitz bar – or you will be to blame for the end of the season in Ischgl and possibly Tirol.”  The text, which was later leaked to an Austrian blog, came from Franz Hörl, deputy head of the Tirolean Chamber of Commerce, spokesman for the association of cable car operators and a member of the conservative Austrian People’s party (OVP).  Soon after Hörl sent a second message: “The entire country is watching your bar,” it said, warning that Tirol might be added to the German foreign office list of high-risk areas. “Please be reasonable,” Hörl begged Zangerl, ending on a promise: “After a week [or] 10 days the furore will have died down and you can decide on the next steps anyway.”  By 6pm, the Kitzloch bar had shut its doors. The lawyers now bringing a class action against Ischgl argue that the entire resort should have immediately followed suit. One of them, Dr Peter Kolba, who is also president of the Austrian Consumer Protection Association, tells me: “If Ischgl had been quarantined a week earlier, thousands of holidaymakers would not have been infected. And the virus would not have spread across Europe.”  When Nigel Mallender (56) arrived in Ischgl on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 10th, he headed straight to Schatzi bar. The venue, where young women in skimpy outfits dance on the tables, was so crowded that he remembers having to walk sideways to get around the bar.  “It was packed,” says the retired banker from Farnborough, Hampshire, who was joining friends for a few days of skiing and partying.  Closures  Earlier in the day regional authorities had ordered all Ischgl’s bars to close “with immediate effect”; but on Tuesday night the ruling was not yet being policed. Some bars, including Schatzi and Trofana Alm, owned by Von der Thannen, kept their doors open and were busier due to the other closures. “It felt like business as usual,” says Mallender, who spent about five hours at Schatzi.  Police began to enforce the ban the following day, but restaurants and hotel bars remained open on Wednesday and Thursday. Ski lifts continued to carry tourists up the mountain at half capacity. In the case of the resort’s largest gondola lift, the Piz Val Gronda E5, this meant that up to 75 skiers at a time spent six minutes inside a closed cabin.  “We didn’t think we had to panic,” Mallender says. “The Austrians came across as calm and sensible.”  The illusion that the clean alpine air would somehow inoculate people from a global pandemic would not dissipate until 2.15pm on Friday, when Mallender received a call from his hotel: “That’s when the bad disaster movie started.” At a press conference 15 minutes earlier, Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz had announced that the entire Paznaun valley would be quarantined “with immediate effect”. Tourists were advised to leave the valley “speedily” and go home.  Mallender, who was staying in the neighbouring village of Galtür, rushed down the mountain, bundled his belongings into a suitcase and tried to book a taxi, to no avail. Panicking, he hurried to the town centre and managed to jump on a bus to Landeck, where he could get a train to Innsbruck, the Tirol capital.  “By the time the bus got to Ischgl it was standing room only, and the bus was moving at walking pace through nose-to-tail traffic.”  The sudden mass evacuation meant it took the bus, packed with around 25 people, 7½ hours to get to Landeck, usually a 40-minute journey.  On Friday night, in a hotel in Innsbruck, Mallender woke up drenched in sweat and suffering from back pain. He tried his best to distance himself from other passengers on his plane home, and self-isolated as soon as he arrived in the UK on the Sunday.  Eleven days later he was taken to hospital; by then he was failing to put three words together without struggling for breath. Speaking on the phone from Hampshire, his voice quivers when he recalls leaving his family behind, unsure if he would see them again.  Class action  Mallender decided to join the class action because he believes the way the authorities handled the outbreak efficiently exported the virus abroad.  “By making everyone leave at the same time they compounded the problem. Anyone on that bus who hadn’t already been infected would have been drenched in the virus by the end of the journey.  “I don’t believe in blame culture,” Mallender adds, “but there was more than a whiff of the Amity Island mayor in Jaws to what happened in the Paznaun valley. If people died because profit was put before wellbeing then that has to be called into question. I am not after financial gain, but there needs to be an open investigation.”  Other visitors report similar problems getting out of the valley. Lisa Busby (54), from Brighton, and four friends were staying at a hotel in St Anton, in the next valley along from Ischgl. After their hotel told them about the pending evacuation on Friday, March 13th, they couldn’t get a taxi or squeeze on to the packed buses.  “Everyone was rushing to get out because they were terrified of having to stay here in quarantine,” she says. “We were completely stuck.”  The women could not believe their luck when a German tourist offered them a lift all the way to Munich. At the end of the journey they exchanged numbers. Two days later Busby and her friends started to feel unwell. On March 22nd their German driver texted to say he had tested positive for Covid-19.  When I speak to Busby in early August, she still hasn’t recovered her sense of taste or smell, and is certain she had the virus though neither she nor her friends were tested at the time.  Johann Friedrich (68), a sporty Austrian who lives near Vienna, arrived in Ischgl with four friends for a week’s skiing on March 7th. His hotel roommate, Hannes Schopf (72), a journalist, got a call from his wife towards the end of their holiday, telling them to get out as soon as possible. They too squeezed on to a packed bus.  Friedrich later experienced only mild symptoms, but his friend was less lucky. On April 10th, Schopf died in hospital, having been unable to see his wife again. Friedrich believes there is a good chance his group caught the virus on the bus out. Neither he nor Schopf had visited a bar on their holiday.  A closed apres-ski bar on March 13th in Ischgl. Photograph: AFP via Getty Images  In early July, the blanket of snow on the mountains flanking Ischgl has melted into a couple of thin patches. The sky is blue and the sun beats down on green meadows. Most bars, cafes and restaurants are shut; only a few cyclists and hikers pass through the town. The posters still advertise apres-ski parties and lapdancing, but the sound systems are quiet.  For the off-season the calm is nothing out of the ordinary. Yet the sense of unease unwittingly conveyed by Ischgl’s tourism slogan emblazoned on park benches, posters and ski lifts – “Relax. If you can... ” – seems more apt than ever. Local people are reluctant to engage in conversation, let alone be interviewed.  Cable cars  Behind the scenes work is going ahead in anticipation of another tourist season starting in November: terraces are being washed and workmen are carrying out maintenance on the cable cars. The Trofana Alm bar has been torn down, to be rebuilt on the same site by November.  “Everything will be new, more modern, with a new ventilation system,” Von der Thannen says, over morning coffee. “There will be more space for a bigger kitchen, but apart from that everything will stay the same.” The planning application, he says, was made last December, long before anyone had heard of Covid-19.  Lockdown has cost Ischgl around 25 per cent to 30 per cent of its annual trade, but Von der Thannen is optimistic that the resort’s reputation won’t be tarnished permanently by its association with the virus.  Kolba sees things differently. His criminal complaint, submitted to Austria’s Federal Economic and Anti-Corruption Office in June, urges the state prosecutor to examine why venues such as Von der Thannen’s bar shut down so late, and the role they played in allowing the virus to spread.  The 36-page legal document names 21 bar owners and local officials as potential suspects, though Kolba says the complaint is ultimately directed against the Austrian government and its “calculated export” of the virus.  While the public prosecutor in Innsbruck continues to gather evidence, Kolba is planning to launch a civil test case in early September. If successful the Austrian government could be liable for hundreds of millions of euro in settlement compensation, for signatories including Charlie Jackson, Johann Friedrich, Nigel Mallender and Lisa Busby.  Irrespective of the legal challenge, Ischgl is likely to change.  In future, Von der Thannen says, the town will have to be more cautious about who it allows to visit: “There are certain kinds of guests we no longer want to see here.”  Too many tourists head straight for the bars, without ever making it to the slopes: Von der Thannen suggests that visitors should be allowed a parking ticket only if they also buy a ski pass, which costs €58 a day at the height of the season. “Guests who come for the skiing, who have booked a room – they are welcome,” he says.  And skiing, Von der Thannen points out, keeps you healthy. In late April a group of virologists came to the valley to mass-test the population and found that while more than 40 per cent had developed Covid-19 antibodies, only 15 per cent had had any symptoms. “A tough people, very resistant,” Von der Thannen recalls one scientist saying. “Almost all the locals ski regularly. We are active and out in the open air. Our fathers and grandfathers worked the fields, and maybe we inherited their genes.  “A lot of things have been written about Ischgl that aren’t true. We have been bad-mouthed and mocked. Could a small village really have gone on to infect the entire world? Ten million people? Surely not.” – Guardian"

It is not a member of the UN Security Council and is ultimately dependent on U.S. protection, yet it is a major regional power that helped contain communist regimes during the Cold War. It has the third largest economy in the world and is ranked as having the world’s fourth most powerful military. Its leaders do not want to revive the militarism of the past, but they are prepared to play a larger role in international affairs. Japan has already acted as peacemaker in Cambodia, Mindanao, and Myanmar. The rising star flag with its 16 red rays, often seen as symbol of militarism and imperialism, is rarely flown by civilians, though Japan has never formally apologized for imperial crimes.  Shinzo Abe, scion of prominent political family, grandson of a prime minister, and son of a foreign minister is the first prime minister to have been born after World War II, and the youngest since the war, when in 2006 he first took the head position which he occupied for a year before resigning due to illness. His second stint as leader started in December 2012 when he was 58, and lasted for almost eight years, making him the longest-serving prime minister in Japanese history. He represents political stability after Japan went through seven leaders in seven years. His political party, the Liberal Democrats, won landslide victories in 2014, 2017, and 2019. The party won 33% of the vote and 218 of the 465 seats in the House of Representatives, and 39% of the vote and controls 170 of the 245 seats in the upper chamber.  Though Abe has been plagued by political problems as well as by COVID-19, he has resigned because of illness, having suffered for some time from ulcerative colitis, a chronic intestinal disease which has no known cure. His successor is likely to be 71-year-old Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary, partly press secretary, partly chief of staff, who comes from a more humble background, son of a strawberry farmer, and who worked in a cardboard factory and fish market before entering politics. He is unlike his boss in two ways: he is believed to favor a free market but apparently lacks any explicit grand vision; and he does not play golf, as Abe has done with the U.S. President.  Abe is generally regarded as a conservative nationalist, but in practice he has been a pragmatic realist in both internal and foreign affairs. As a nationalist, he has been unwilling to define the character of World War II or to discuss war crimes by Japanese soldiers, “I think we have to wait for the estimation of historians.” At best, he speaks of Japanese “self-defense” in the war. But he strengthened ties with the U.S. and had cordial relations with his golf partner President Donald Trump, sought alliances with Australia and India to contain China, and been more assertive on the international scene, though uncomfortable with South Korea over the “comfort women” issue.  Abe is best known for his economic policies, popularly known as Abenomics, and proposed economic and social reforms in a country whose population is aging and has a low birthrate. In essence, his aims were to encourage economic growth, reduce unemployment, increase corporate earnings, enter into trade agreements, reduce the public debt, and revive the sluggish economy. The proposals were aimed with three “arrows:” bold and aggressive monetary policy, easing money by the Bank of Japan; flexible fiscal consolidation; and accelerate growth with government spending.  It partly worked as stock market prices increased as did consumer spending, the yen was weakened, thus helping exports and equity markets, and large firms. The Economist called Abenomics a mix of reflation, government spending, and growth strategy. The economic policy maintained a sense of stability, encourage start-ups, cut red tape, led to record employment. Steady inflation stimulated higher investment and spending, the Bank of Japan set a target of 2% inflation and bought trillions of government bonds.  But problems arose. The inflation rate of 2% was not reached. Consumer taxes rose twice, first from 5% to 8% in 2014, then 10% in 2019. Public debt has risen as a percentage of GDP. The electricity market was liberalized, and two trade deals were reached, but there was little structural reform. One deal in September 2019 was a mini deal with the U.S. with exchange of U.S. beef, pork, and wheat in exchange for U.S. tariff reductions on Japanese industrial products.  As a nationalist Abe wanted to revise Article 9 of the Constitution to permit Japan to maintain military forces. His electoral slogan in 2012 was “take back Japan.” He favored bolstered defense with new amphibious weapons, and also allowing Japanese forces to maneuver outside the country’s borders. In 2015 he sponsored legislation that permitted the Japanese Self-Defense forces to engage in overseas combat and take part in missions such as peacekeeping in the Sinai peninsula in 2019 alongside allied forces.  While prime minister, he visited Yasukuni Shrine several times. The shrine is supposed to house not only the bodies of the war dead but also the “souls” of the dead. Two controversies have resulted. One is that because of the principle of separation of state and religion in Japan, it is improper for a government official to visit a shrine. The other factor is that due to the nature of war crimes committed by some soldiers it is even more improper for them to be honored by political figures.  On the international stage, Abe had good relations with the U.S. and with the 54,000 U.S. troops in Japan and with Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. But still unresolved is the 70-year-old dispute with Russia over four islands that Japan calls the Northern Territories, and Russia the southern Kurils, which Russia took after World War II when it deported all Japanese. A Russia community lives on the isles, which are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and may have offshore resources of oil and gas. In 1956 Russia restored diplomatic relations with Japan, but the latter never recognized the four islands as part of the Russian Kuril chain. Nevertheless, Abe wanted to strengthen political and economic relations with Russia, investing in Russia, holding joint military exercises and cultural exchanges of art collections. and suggested joint projects on the disputed isles. But the disputes with China over the uninhabited Senkaku islands and over Japan’s sovereignty of Okinawa remain.  A troublesome issue involves the continuing dispute with South Korean “comfort women” forced to have sex with Japanese troops during WW II. At first, Abe questioned the role of military coercion of the women, estimated variously at 80,000 to 200,000, but in 2014 and 2015 he upheld the Kono statement of 1993, that the military did play a role, and agreed to a fund of 1 million yen to support the remaining women victims.  COVID-19 has led to problems in Japan as elsewhere. Among them are a vast economic decline, over 7% in the second quarter of 2020, the postponement of the summer Olympic games due to be held in Tokyo in July 2020, and delay in trade arrangements with the EU and expanding the Trans-Pacific trade partnership to lower tariff and other barriers to trade, and indirectly to reduce dependence on Chinese trade.  Japan seeks to be a normal country with stable government, a self-defense force, and no military aspirations. The U.S. should maintain and welcome close relations with it.  Image: Pixabay"

I feel proud to be part of an international community that dares to value concord over conflict, diplomacy over warfare, and democracy over dictatorship.  The Nobel Peace Prize represents our aspiration for a kinder world – and recognises those who continue to fight for peace. So, can this prestigious award retain its symbolic value in an age of politicking and populism?  So far there are 134 historic Nobel laureates, since 1901. Recent winners include former US president Barack Obama, the International Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the Iraqi human rights activist and writer Nadia Murad. So, it might seem rather surprising that Donald Trump has recently been nominated for the prize in 2021.  President Trump is unfit for nomination and his inclusion makes a mockery of this important accolade. This is not merely due to his incendiary Twitter rants and threats of nuclear war. Trump has not dealt with persistent systemic inequalities and has mostly refused to deal with the climate crisis – as well as leaving a large Covid-19 death toll in his wake. This is not peace.  “It’s hard to imagine an individual less worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize,” said Tim Wright, a 2017 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, recognised for his work with the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. “He has fomented violence against his own citizens, abandoned longstanding arms control agreements, and undermined multilateralism at every opportunity. His few diplomatic initiatives, such as the summits with North Korea, have been little more than photo-ops.” It is unlikely that Trump will win the Nobel Peace Prize, announced via a virtual ceremony on 9 October, but regardless he has been nominated by right-wing Norwegian MP Christian Tybring-Gjedde for his purported role in the Israel-UAE deal.  Beyond the dubious ethics of this ignoble selection, we may have to wait half a century to learn what became of his nomination – the Nobel Prize Committee operates in complete confidentiality, vowing to never, ever announce the names of either nominators or nominees, only winners. The deliberations over Trump’s nomination remain to been seen by our future archivists and historians – but the outcome of such deliberations will influence the very fate of the Nobel Peace Prize itself.  Trump is not the first unpalatable Nobel Peace Prize nominee. The Nobel Committee has a controversial history of both awards and omissions. In 1973, the prize was won by US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, who was involved in Operation Condor and bombing campaigns in Cambodia.  Meanwhile, it has not been awarded posthumously to Mahatma Gandhi, arguably one of the greatest advocates of non-violent resistance in history.  Anybody can be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize but only “qualified nominators” may throw their hat into the ring and offer suggestions for future nominees. You might be surprised to learn who qualifies to make this important choice – and you may even be able to make a qualified nomination of your own.  You can make a nomination if you are a current or former member of the Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee or a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Politicians and heads of state can also contribute their preferred candidates, as can members of the International Court of Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, l’Institut de Droit International and the international board of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom.  University professors, emeritus professors, and associate professors (equivalent to senior lecturer or reader in the UK) are also qualified nominators for the Nobel Peace Prize. If you lecture and research in history, social sciences, law, philosophy, theology or religion at this level, then you can nominate your preferred candidate for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize simply by using an online nomination form until February 2021. You can also nominate someone if you are a university leader, the director of a peace research institute, or a foreign policy institute.  Be warned, that it is not possible to appeal or revoke a Nobel prize after it has been awarded to a person or organisation.  But perhaps it is time for us to work together to select someone who is worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize. I would vote for New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern to win – but there are countless deserving people and organisations out there.  As a matter of principle, the “Norwegian Nobel Committee never comment upon what the peace prize aureates may say and do after they have been awarded the prize”. With this in mind, we must choose wisely."

Photo / Getty Images  There are many ways in which the coronavirus pandemic has exposed the weakness of the West, and this week China moved up a gear in the pivotal area of vaccine diplomacy.  A string of positive announcements from Beijing contrasted sharply with the mood in the West, which was dominated by the news the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine trial had been briefly paused following a suspected adverse reaction in a British volunteer.  Scientists and financial analysis are now, perhaps for the first time, seriously considering whether China might be first to develop an effective vaccine (see graphic below).  Diplomats, meanwhile, are turning their attention to what that might mean for geopolitics in the difficult winter months ahead. It could make the flare-ups over China's exports of face masks and ventilators during the early stages of the pandemic look like minor spats.  In truth, China has been at or near the front of the Covid-19 vaccine race from the off. Of the nine candidates in Phase Three trials, four are Chinese.  And while the leading western candidates – Oxford-AstraZeneca, BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna – have all won plaudits for their use of state-of-the-art technology platforms, experts are starting to wonder whether China's strategy of focusing on ""old school"" vaccine technologies may eventually prove to be more prudent.  ""Three of the four Chinese candidates use inactivated SARs-CoV-2 virus, which ultimately may prove to be the best bet,"" said Dr Vipul Chowdhary, technical lead at leading biomedical think tank Policy Cures Research.  ""All they have done is basically disable the virus at the same time as maintaining its antigen properties. It is the traditional method. So it should normally provide good defence and pose less potential for reactions compared to the others.""  The graphic below shows the steps in the search for a vaccine:  Dr Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and the co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, agreed.  ""Instinctively I feel a little more comfortable with inactivated vaccines because we have a lot of experience with them,"" he said. ""The other advantage is that you're making an immune response to all four of the coronavirus proteins, not just the spike protein.""  A first claim of efficacy  This week, China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a state-run vaccine company, said early data from its Phase Three trials showed that its two leading immunisations were effective in preventing volunteers contracting Covid-19 – the first time a claim of efficacy has been made.  Zhou Song, the secretary for the commission for discipline inspection with CNBG, told China National Radio on Monday that ""hundreds of thousands have taken the shot and no one has shown any obvious adverse effects or got infected"". He added that the company's two vaccines were likely to protect people for up to three years.  Dr Chowdhary cautioned that such ""unverified claims mean nothing – only an adequately designed Phase Three trial showing a clear and statistically significant benefit in the intervention arm compared to placebo can prove the effectiveness"".  Nevertheless, China, like others, is getting into the vaccine diplomacy game. It is using its early success to amplify the country's political influence, restore frosty relationships and further promote an image of the nation as a global health leader.  Bangladesh, where vaccine manufacturer Sinovac Biotech is testing its jab, will receive roughly 110,000 free doses if the shot proves successful, while China is offering Latin American and Caribbean nations $1 billion in loans to buy its vaccines.  In southeast Asia, China has told countries including the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam that they will gain priority access to any future vaccine.  And in Africa – where China, Europe and the United States are wrestling for influence – President Xi Jinping said during a summer summit that the continent ""will be among the first to benefit"" once its Covid-19 vaccines are completed.  Critics point out that such largesse will undoubtedly come with strings, explicit or otherwise. Remaining silent about Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its treatment of its minority ethnic and religious groups are almost certainly a prerequisite.  Others say China's bid to become a powerhouse in global health is being aided by US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the World Health Organisation (WHO) in particular and the world stage more generally.  Trump has flatly refused to join Covax – a WHO initiative to share vaccines globally – leaving the way clear for China to play a leading role if it joins before the final participants are expected to be announced on Friday.  Some commentators fear his ""vaccine nationalism"" may also see countries use a Chinese vaccine even if good data on safety and efficacy is lacking.  Dr Paul Offit added that if China or Russia are first to license a jab, political pressure may mount on regulators elsewhere to push through early approval.  But not all the cards are stacked in China's favour.  Quite apart from political suspicion, China, like others, has been rocked by vaccine safety scandals in the past, and its regulatory system is opaque and may not inspire confidence.  ""I think scientists and the public don't trust China, just like they don't trust Russia,"" said Dr Offit. ""They don't trust the vaccine data, just like they still don't trust the [coronavirus] case and death numbers.""  The logistical problems that stand in the way  There are serious logistical issues, too. China's success in suppressing the epidemic early on means that, like others, it has had to look further afield to set up Phase Three trials, including in the United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh (where this is little transmission of the virus) and some 9,000 health workers in Brazil.  Manufacturing and distribution could prove to be another sticking point. While traditional inactivated vaccines are less complex, said Dr Chowdhary, the manufacturing process is slowed by the need for high security labs to grow live virus at the start of the process.  Also, China does not have a large scale and globally established vaccine export business like India, for example.  Even its domestic manufacturing capability is unclear. CNBG says it has constructed a new factory, doubling its capacity to more than 200 million doses a year, while Sinovac has a new plant in Beijing capable of producing roughly 300 million doses annually – but neither is enough to cover the country's entire population.  The risk of antibody dependent enhancement  There is one great leveller in the vaccine race.  Vaccine makers of all nationalities face one particular significant hurdle, the spectre of which was raised when the Oxford vaccine was suspended last week: there is a risk that the antibodies created by a vaccine interact with those naturally acquired to spark a potentially dangerous adverse reaction. This is known as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE).  The problem for vaccine makers is testing for it. In most, perhaps all, the trials run to date, volunteers are screened ahead of time to check they have not got existing SARs-CoV-2 antibodies before being given a jab. They are then monitored for adverse reactions if and when they come into contact with the natural virus.  But Dr Chowdhary said there was a theoretical risk ADE could happen the other way round if someone previously exposed to the virus was then inoculated with new antibodies.  ""It is only a theoretical risk. But in science, unless we can prove it's not there, we don't say it's not there. And as far as I know, we haven't done that yet,"" he said."

The 27-member ASEAN Regional Forum, including the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the United States, China and Japan, is one of the very few multilateral events attended by North Korea’s foreign minister almost every year.  With escalating Sino-U.S. tensions impacting security risks and economic structures in the region, the world’s two major powers were expected to clash in the meeting over matters such as China’s military activities in regional waters and human rights.  Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh said at the outset of the forum that it is important to reduce security risks by creating mutual trust amid an increasingly complicated regional situation.  Vaccine development may also be a source of conflict between the United States and China at the gathering, while remarks by North Korea, which has not carried out ballistic missile tests for more than five months, will be of interest.  However, this year’s regional meeting could prove to be relatively low-key, given that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon are absent. Other senior officials from the respective nations participated.  Beijing has rapidly built artificial islands with military infrastructure in the South China Sea, further chilling relations with the United States which has been intensifying its offensive against the Asian power over security issues.  Washington said in July that it is taking a tougher stance against Beijing’s maritime assertiveness, calling its claims to offshore resources across most of the contested waters “completely unlawful.”  In late June, meanwhile, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, China’s top legislative body, enacted a security law for Hong Kong that bans acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces in the former British colony.  On July 14, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order to fully end the special treatment extended to Hong Kong under U.S. law, saying that he will hold China accountable for its “oppressive actions” against the people of the territory.  From North Korea, An Kwang Il, ambassador to Indonesia, participated in the security forum instead of the foreign minister. The nation’s economy has been hit hard by the global virus pandemic and natural disasters.  The ARF comprises the 10 ASEAN states, China, Japan, the United States, Russia, North and South Korea, India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the European Union, Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh, East Timor, Mongolia and Sri Lanka.

On offer are a total of five million tickets, up 10 percent year-on-year.  Vietnam Airlines and its subsidiaries Pacific Airlines and Vietnam Air Services Company (VASCO) are offering two million tickets, while Vietjet and Bamboo Airways each have 1.5 million.  Ticketing agencies have already begun recording bookings for the holiday, even though it is still five months away. Salespeople say the most popular routes are between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and between Ho Chi Minh City and the northern Hai Phong City and the central Nghe An Province. Vietnamese people in big cities typically travel back to their hometowns during Tet.  Airfares for a return ticket between Hanoi and HCMC during the first two weekends of February cost VND6-7 million ($260-302).  Airlines are also offering promotions from several hundred thousand dong (VND100,000 = $4.31) for a return ticket in mid-January. They will offer refunds if flights are canceled by authorities over Covid-19 situations.  Industry insiders express confidence that the next holiday will boost revenues of the aviation industry, which has been crippled this year by travel restrictions.  Bui Doan Ne, general secretary of the Vietnam Aviation Business Association (VABA), said that as Vietnam has been able to contain the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak, domestic travel will become vibrant again next month.  With six international routes planned to be resumed this month, the financial situation of local airlines should improve soon, and a large number of passengers are expected to travel during Tet 2021, he added.  Lai Xuan Thanh, chairman of the Airports Corporation of Vietnam that manages 22 airports, said the aviation industry in Vietnam seems to be better off than many others in the world, and local airlines could survive the pandemic if their revenues surge during the next holiday.  Airlines are also making plans to expand their fleet for post-pandemic scenarios. Vietnam Airlines plans to purchase 50 narrow-body aircraft, assessing that now would be a good time to negotiate with aircraft manufacturers amid the mass cancellations of orders globally.  The CEO of budget carrier Vietjet, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, also said the airline will purchase more aircraft but did not reveal specifics.

United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to Southeast Asia and accused China of “aggression” in the South China Sea and manipulating the flow of the Mekong River in a time of drought.  Touting U.S. investment in the region and support for the COVID-19 response of the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Pompeo said Washington will speak out in the face of China’s “threats to sovereign nations’ ability to make free choices.”  “We stand with our ASEAN partners as we insist on the rule of law and respect for sovereignty in the South China Sea, where Beijing has pursued aggressive campaigns of coercion and environmental devastation,” Pompeo said in a statement released during a summit of top ASEAN diplomats held online this week and hosted by Vietnam.  The top U.S. diplomat accused China of exacerbating the drought in nations downstream on the Mekong River.  “We stand for transparency and respect in the Mekong region, where the CCP [Chinese Communist party] has abetted arms and narcotics trafficking and unilaterally manipulated upstream dams, exacerbating an historic drought,” Pompeo said.  His statement did not provide evidence to support the allegation of the CCP aiding weapons and drugs smuggling.  Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam have been grappling with variable water flow on the Mekong that supports the livelihoods of tens of millions of people. While poor rains have caused the drought, environmentalists say dams that China has constructed on the upper reaches of the river have worsened the situation.  Rising tensions  Pompeo’s rhetoric underscores the rapid deterioration in U.S.-China relations on a raft of issues in recent months, including trade, the status of Hong Kong, the plight of Uyghur Muslims and China’s assertion of “historic rights” to most of the disputed South China Sea.  On Thursday, Pompeo had urged Southeast Asian countries to reconsider business deals with the 24 Chinese companies that Washington sanctioned last month for their roles in constructing Beijing’s artificial islands in the South China Sea.  In recent years, Beijing has undertaken major reclamation of disputed land features in the Paracel and Spratly island chains.  ASEAN nations Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines also have territorial claims in the South China Sea and seek to use resources in areas that China claims for itself.  Beijing further claims parts of that sea overlapping the exclusive economic zone of Indonesia, the largest ASEAN member.  For its part, Beijing this week accused the U.S. of interference in the region’s affairs. On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi called the U.S. the “biggest driver of militarization of the South China Sea,” Chinese media reported.  “The United States is becoming the most dangerous factor damaging peace in the South China Sea,” Wang said at the East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers’ Meeting.  Southeast Asian nations are uneasy about being caught in the war of words between the U.S. and China.  In the ASEAN joint communique made public on Thursday, the bloc, which operates by consensus, expressed concern over increased tensions in the South China Sea and called for resolution of disputes in accordance with the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS.  A day before that, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told reporters that the group’s countries did not want to “get caught up in the rivalry between major powers.” Vietnam, too, said on Wednesday that the dispute threatens regional stability and that countries should settle the acrimonious row by adhering to international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS.  While Friday’s toughly worded statement from the U.S. was issued by Pompeo, the State Department public schedule showed that his deputy, Stephen Biegun, was the leading U.S. delegate at the ASEAN virtual meetings that day.  Pompeo was traveling to the Middle East to attend the opening of Afghan peace talks.  The ASEAN summit ends Saturday after the ASEAN Regional Forum on peace and security. The 27-member forum includes 10 ASEAN states, India, Japan, China, the U.S., Russia and the European Union.  Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service."

Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, said on Sunday that as cases across the border keep increasing -- 2,595 in Myanmar, 1,060 in Vietnam, 274 in Cambodia and 23 in Laos -- Thailand must impose stricter protection especially where illegal migrants looking for work in Thailand are concerned.  Dr Suwannachai said the department is conducting more inspections in border checkpoints and working with police, soldiers and village health volunteers to increase surveillance along natural border areas where illegal migrants enter the country.  He said the department has trained volunteers about screening tests, self-protection, searching infected people, passing on health knowledge and arranging local quarantine places.  Meanwhile, in Ubon Ratchathani, 14 Lao migrants travelling in a van bound for Bangkok were arrested early yesterday in Muang district of this northeastern province.  Pol Capt Pakin Purithadawatana, a Muang traffic police officer, said the van was stopped for a search on a ring road near Big C superstore at about 1am while it was heading out of the town.  Found in the van were 14 Lao migrants, all of them from Champassak province of Laos. The van driver was Patipol Chanthakhet, 54, from Surin's Lamduan district.  The migrants said they they took a boat from Ban Mai Singsamphan of Muang Sanasomboun across the Mekong River to the Thai side of the border at Ban Huay Mak Tai in Ubon Ratchathani's Khong Chiam district.  From there, they were taken on a vehicle to a PTT petrol station in Tan Sum district where Mr Patipol was waiting with the van. The migrants said they paid 4,000 baht each to brokers who arranged the trip.  Mr Patipol said he was to be paid 15,000 baht to take the migrants from the PTT petrol station to Bangkok.  The migrants were charged with illegal entry and had their temperatures taken before being handed over to the immigration police for further action.  Meanwhile, the country has added seven more coronavirus infections, raising the total tally to 3,473. The Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration(CCSA) on Sunday announced seven new cases imported from Bahrain, India and Australia. Fatalities remain unchanged at 58.  Vitit Saritdeechaikul, the provincial health office director in Buri Ram, said 42 players and staff members of Buriram United are being quarantined after their return from the club's training ground in Samut Prakan on Saturday."

The Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare yesterday also reported 1,114 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking total fatalities up to 78,586.  Even as infections are growing faster in India than anywhere else in the world, the number of people recovering from the virus has also risen sharply.  An official at an exam center in Hyderabad, India, yesterday checks the temperature of a test-taker at the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for those hoping to enter medical or dental colleges as undergraduates. Photo: AP  The country’s recovery rate stands at 77.77 percent and nearly 70,000 recoveries have been reported every day this month, according to the ministry.  The ministry attributed India’s COVID-19 recovery pace to aggressive testing and prompt surveillance, but experts say India needs to test more due to its huge population.  It has climbed to the second worst-hit country behind the US, and is now testing more than 1 million people every day.  The Indian parliament is expected to resume work today with strict physical distancing. It adjourned in March just before a nationwide lockdown was announced to contain the pandemic.  The harsh lockdown caused a severe economic crisis, with India’s economy contracting nearly 24 percent in the second quarter, the worst among the world’s top economies.  In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:  Domestic air travel in Wuhan, the epicenter of the global COVID-19 outbreak, has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Since reopening in early April after a draconian 76-day lockdown, life has gradually returned to normal and numbers of domestic flights serving the city, as well as the number of passengers, had both fully recovered, according to the operator of Wuhan Tianhe International airport.  It says 64,700 passengers were transported aboard 500 domestic flights on Friday.  The airport is preparing to eventually resume international flights to destinations such as Seoul, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta, an airport representative was quoted as saying by Xinhua news agency.  International cargo routes have already reopened connecting the major industrial city and center of the Chinese auto industry with destinations such as Amsterdam and New Delhi.  China has gone almost a month without registering a new case of local transmission and yesterday, the Chinese National Health Commission reported just 10 new cases, all of them imported.  Thailand is tightening monitoring measures at border checkpoints to prevent the spread of COVID-19 from neighboring countries, the Thai Ministry of Health said.  Local health volunteers would patrol natural borders with Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Malaysia, and watch out for the smuggling of foreign workers, it said.  Thailand yesterday reported seven imported cases, raising its total to 3,473. Fifty-eight people have died from the virus.  The Indonesian Ministry of Health yesterday reported 3,636 new cases and 73 new deaths.  South Korea is relaxing social-distancing rules in the greater Seoul area as the number of confirmed cases tapers after last month’s surge.  South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun yesterday said distancing requirements would be lowered to level 2 from level 2.5 for two weeks.  The announcement came hours after the government confirmed 121 new cases, the second-lowest total in the past month.  “We shouldn’t let our guard down, given one out of four cases can’t be traced back,” Chung said in an address televised on Yonhap TV. “But tighter quarantine is showing its effect slowly.”  However, Chung warned of tougher social distancing rules during the Chuseok holiday — the Korean harvest festival — from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2 and urged people to stay home.  Level 2 forbids indoor gatherings of 50 or more people, affecting everything from weddings to amusement parks, but as of today, franchise coffee-shops can resume normal operations after being restricted to take-outs, while restaurants and bakeries can return to normal hours and indoor gyms and hagwons — private cram schools — are to reopen.  In Australia, Victoria, the state with the nation’s highest transmission of the virus, has recorded a small rise in new cases, the Department of Health and Human Services said yesterday, ahead of plans to ease one of the world’s strictest community containments as of midnight last night.  Forty-one new cases were reported in the past 24 hours and seven new deaths, it said in a Twitter post yesterday morning.  Meanwhile, Melbourne police arrested 74 people and fined 176 for flouting stay-at-home orders to protest against lockdown restrictions, with some demonstrators clashing with riot police at the central Queen Victoria market.  About 250 people took part in the illegal protest — the second in as many days in the city — promoted by coronavirus conspiracy groups on social media.  They were met by a heavy police presence, with scuffles breaking out as the riot squad swept through market’s fruit and vegetable aisles.  One man believed to be a “primary agitator” is facing charges of incitement, the police said.  Additional reporting by agencies"

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.  The Southeast Asian bloc has established development partnerships with France and Italy while including Columbia and Cuba in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC), Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh told a press conference on AMM 53 and related meetings that wrapped up in Hanoi on Saturday afternoon.  Regarding the U.K.’s proposal to become an ASEAN dialogue partner, Minh said the bloc acknowledged the country’s significant role both regionally and internationally and in the relationship between the U.K. and ASEAN member countries.  ""ASEAN member countries are considering the U.K.’s proposal based on ASEAN regulations, as well as cooperation outcomes and commitments of countries in general that seek to become the bloc’s dialogue partners,"" he added.  Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Quoc Dung, head of the ASEAN Senior Officials’ Meeting Vietnam, had said last week that many countries have proposed setting up partnerships with ASEAN as the bloc’s role and position have advanced in recent times.  ASEAN currently has partner relationships with 16 countries and blocs; and has eight strategic partners - Australia, China, the E.U., India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea and the U.S.  The bloc has 10 members: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.  Within the framework of AMM 53 and related meetings held September 9-12 via online conferences, ASEAN’s current partners continued supporting the central role of the bloc in shaping an open, inclusive, transparent and rules-based regional architecture.  ASEAN and its partners agreed to intensify the role and efficiency of ASEAN-chaired forums, including the East Asia Summit (EAS), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM+).  They reiterated commitments to multilateral cooperation and the framework of relations between countries on the basis of principles of international law, while stepping up fruitful cooperation in coping with emerging challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic.  Minh said that the topic of strategic competition among major countries has been discussed in ASEAN forums, including the EAS and the ARF.  The ministers affirmed their determination to maintain Southeast Asia as a region of peace, security, neutrality and stability while strengthening ASEAN’s central role, unity and resilience. They will also continue promoting trust building, mutual respect and the rule of law in line with the spirit of the Foreign Ministers' Statement on the occasion of marking the 53rd founding anniversary of ASEAN on August 8, 2020.  The statement ""demonstrates the central role of ASEAN and the bloc doesn’t want to be stuck in competition between countries, affecting the peace and stability of the region,"" Minh emphasized.  Regarding initiatives proposed by China, including the linking of the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025 (MPAC) with Beijing's Belt and Road initiative and on global security data, Deputy PM Minh said ASEAN is an open community and always welcomes partners' initiatives that contribute to mutual development and build an environment of peace, stability and shared prosperity in the region.  All ASEAN members support the initiatives by China, and ministers have assigned relevant agencies of all sides to research in order to make appropriate proposals, Minh added.  South China Sea  Minh said the South China Sea issue has been mentioned in all ASEAN forums in the spirit of calling for parties to contribute to maintaining peace, stability, security, safety and freedom of navigation and aviation in the region.  ASEAN members have called for all parties to respect international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).  The South China Sea is known as the East Sea in Vietnam.  ""For countries that are members of UNCLOS such as Vietnam, China and other ASEAN countries, compliance with the convention is as a matter of course,"" Minh said, in response to questions on whether China was complying with UNCLOS.  Minh also said that at AMM 53, ASEAN has stressed the significance and interests of peace, stability, security, safety and freedom of navigation and aviation in the South China Sea, confirming they are the interests of all countries. ""This stance has continued to receive the support of partner countries.""  He added that the participating ministers also agreed on the need to promote dialogue, enhance trust building, refrain from acts that would increase tensions and complicate the situation, avoid militarization and using or threatening to use force, and settle disputes through peaceful measures on the basis of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS.  Minh noted that ministers expressed their hope for full and efficient implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and called for the early completion of a binding, effective Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) in line with international law.  At the press conference, Minh said the ministers adopted 42 documents at the AMM 53 and related meetings, including the joint communique of AMM 53 and the ARF Hanoi Plan of Action II (2020-2025).  Notably, 10 initiatives raised by Vietnam were passed, including the Hanoi statement on the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the EAS and the organization of a meeting of the EAS expert group on the Covid-19 pandemic.  Minh said that as the ASEAN Chair 2020, Vietnam is actively preparing for the 37th ASEAN Summit slated for November this year, hoping that countries would have achieved better control over the Covid-19 crisis by then.  Vietnam has reported 1,060 Covid-19 cases so far, of which 112 are active. It has confirmed 35 Covid-19 deaths. The country has recorded no new domestic transmissions for ten days."

Sign up here to have it delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.  This week you have a pandemic, wildfires with dozens of fatalities and many more missing, a brewing hurricane, kids going to school online and uncertain job security all hammering away on your last nerve. No wonder you are grinding your teeth.  The Washington Posts’ Emily Sohn’s dentist told her that since the pandemic she has seen more dental problems related to teeth grinding and jaw clenching. And maybe, just maybe, stress is at the core of it.  WKBW in Buffalo heard the same thing from a dentist:  “People are coming with more tension type headaches, migraines, decreased opening. They’ll say, ‘I used to be able to eat a turkey club sandwich, but now I can’t open as big,” said Dr. Michelle Augello, DDS, owner of Nickel City Dentistry on Hertel Ave. 30-40% of her patients complain about these kinds of issues and she thinks it’s all because of stress caused by COVID-19. “It is a stressful climate in our world right now. They were clenching and grinding their teeth and they were breaking a lot of teeth,” said Dr. Augello. And repairing that kind of damage could cost you anywhere from a $100 to thousands.  Katie Camero, a national reporter for McClatchy, found that people who had their teeth grinding under control have seen those problems flare up again during the COVID-19 pandemic.  “I have noticed a flare up of patients that were under control now having jaw pain and many of them attributed that to increased bruxism, or grinding of their teeth,” Dr. Sherwin Arman, the director of the orofacial pain program at the UCLA School Of Dentistry, told McClatchy News. Due to the pandemic and protective protocols, Arman only treats patients in emergency situations experiencing acute pain. Some of his regular patients who appeared to have their grinding under control, are now back where they began.  Interestingly, while we know a lot about nighttime clenching and teeth grinding (called bruxism), the damage we do to our teeth while we are awake is less studied. The Post article said:  There is no official data about whether the stress of the pandemic has produced a spike in bruxism and related teeth damage. … Scientists have yet to conduct the kinds of experiments that would show definitively that stress can be a cause of bruxism at all, although there are clues that it does make a difference. For example, plenty of studies have shown that nighttime teeth-grinding commonly occurs in people who experience stress, anxiety, depression or other psychological issues. But most studies have been correlational, which leaves open the possibility that nighttime grinding might be the cause of disrupted sleep and that sleep-disruption, in turn, messes with mood and emotions during the day, says Sylvia Kriebig, a research psychologist at Stanford University in California, who studies the bodily effects of emotions.  The New York Times published an essay from a dentist, Dr. Tammy Chen, who said since she reopened her practice in June, she has seen tooth fracture cases every single day. “I have seen more tooth fractures in the last six weeks than I have seen in six years,” she said. Dr. Chen wrote:  When I reopened my practice in early June, the fractures started coming in: at least one a day, every single day that I’ve been in the office. On average, I’m seeing three to four; the bad days are six-plus fractures. What’s going on? One obvious answer is stress. From COVID-induced nightmares to “doomsurfing” to “coronaphobia,” it’s no secret that pandemic-related anxiety is affecting our collective mental health. That stress, in turn, leads to clenching and grinding, which can damage the teeth. But more specifically, the surge I’m seeing in tooth trauma may be a result of two additional factors. First, an unprecedented number of Americans are suddenly working from home, often wherever they can cobble together a makeshift workstation: on the sofa, perched on a barstool, tucked into a corner of the kitchen counter. The awkward body positions that ensue can cause us to hunch our shoulders forward, curving the spine into something resembling a C-shape. If you’re wondering why a dentist cares about ergonomics, the simple truth is that poor posture during the day can translate into a grinding problem at night.  The second factor, Dr. Chen wrote in the Times, is that we are not getting enough “restorative sleep,” which means we never relax our jaw muscles. One big tip, she says, is to try to relax before bedtime. Pay attention to clenching habits during the day and if you use a mouthpiece at night, consider “popping it in” in the daytime, especially during stressful periods of the day.  International college enrollment is WAY down  International students represent a significant income stream for universities — while they make up 6% of college enrollments in the U.S., they contribute big bucks. The American Council on Education estimated international student enrollment might be down by 25% this fall.  Schools said a growing percentage of international students are sitting out this semester and will try again in 2021. Axios spelled out some of the barriers:  U.S. embassies and consulate offices are just beginning to reopen, and both universities and students worry a backlog for visa approvals could persist into next year. Some students under a travel restriction may even try to enter the U.S. through a third country, quarantine for 14 days and then board a plane to the U.S. “We can never recommend that,” Ravi Shankar, assistant vice provost and director of the International Services Office at the University of Rochester, tells Axios. “You have to make the decision that is best for you, but we say please take into consideration the safety and security when you’re considering going into a third country like Cambodia or Vietnam for example.”  Here is some data from OpenDoorsData.org that might help you get local on this story:  Axios reported that new regulations may be coming very soon that could complicate life for international students and recruiting for universities:  The Trump administration plans to propose a rule in coming weeks to make international students request visa extensions after two or four years of study, administration officials tell Axios. Right now, foreign students can stay indefinitely as long as they meet requirements proving they are students. The proposal would essentially set up mandatory check-ins with the Department of Homeland Security in an attempt to prevent overstays. While ICE oversees the student visa program, the proposed extension process would go through the backlogged U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).  Farmers and health care workers gain popularity as the most admired industries during COVID-19  Farmers were already high on Gallup’s “most-admired” industries list before this year, but maybe a little food emergency sharpened our appreciation for the people who put food on our tables. Same for health care workers.  Athletes and members of Congress did not fare so well. And the TV/radio and publishing industries ranked around the same as the oil industry and airlines.  Gallup says the trends show:  Farming and agriculture were already among the top-rated industries before 2020, but it has now moved to No. 1 with a 69% positive rating — an 11-percentage-point increase.  With a 13-point increase to 51%, the healthcare industry has advanced from the third-lowest-ranked industry to near the middle of the pack. This is the first time in the 20 years of Gallup measurement that a majority of Americans have rated health care positively. The latest reading mirrors the increase in Americans’ confidence in the medical system that Gallup found earlier this year.  The pharmaceutical industry’s positive rating has increased seven points to 34%. The industry is now the second-lowest-rated on a net (positive minus negative rating) basis.  The biggest slide, however, has been for the sports industry, with its positive score falling 15 points — from 45% to 30%.  It is noteworthy that even while the pharmaceutical industry gained popularity it is still the second-lowest rated industry on the list. Both political parties constantly attack Big Pharma over drug prices while praising them for their work on vaccines and accepting huge political contributions.  Reaction versus anticipation  We are so much more focused on reaction than anticipation, it seems. The Los Angeles Times reminded us that 19 years ago, the third United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned us that we would be facing raging wildfires and more intense hurricanes. And now, they are here, in this week’s headlines.  “This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone,” said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “Maybe we underestimated the magnitude and speed” at which these events would occur, he said, but “we’ve seen this long freight train barreling down on us for decades, and now the locomotive is on top of us, with no caboose in sight.” In a matter of weeks, California has experienced six of the 20 largest wildfires in modern history and toppled all-time temperature records from the desert to the coast. Millions are suffering from some of the worst air quality in years due to heat-triggered smog and fire smoke. A sooty plume has blanketed most of the West Coast, blotting out the sun and threatening people’s lungs during a deadly pandemic.  New research points to Death Valley-like temperatures becoming more common, even on the California coast. And extreme temperatures vastly increase fire danger. The study said, “the observed frequency of autumn days with extreme (95th percentile) fire weather — which we show are preferentially associated with extreme autumn wildfires — has more than doubled in California since the early 1980s.”  The way we work/live now  Adrienne Roark is a longtime newsperson (and friend) who is now a general manager at KPTV in Portland, Oregon.

Context: The five new orders follow pressure from unions and activists groups for clothing brands to stop sourcing from the Uighur region within 12 months. The groups estimate about one-fifth of all cotton garments sold in the world contain Xinjiang cotton or yarn.  CBP has also issued a dozen previous WROs on various products from the Xinjiang region to combat concerns of forced labor, Morgan said on the call. About 85 percent of China’s cotton is grown in Xinjiang, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.

Cuccinelli added that the U.S. government is trying to develop methods to determine if other products are produced with forced labor.  ""We are working on advancing the technology to trace even directly where product like this comes from,"" he said. ""We’d like businesses in other parts of the world that would like to do business in the U.S. to disentangle themselves from this set of horrific practices.""  Pressure ramping up: The move puts further strain on U.S.-China relations, which have already deteriorated this year because of tensions over the coronavirus and Beijing's crackdown on political dissent in Hong Kong.  The United States imported close to $50 billion worth of textiles from China last year. Uighur cotton, yarn and fabric is used by other countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to make clothing. Policing that volume of imports would be a massive undertaking for the CBP.  Xinjiang, a vast province in northwestern China, produces an estimated 70 percent of Chinese tomatoes, which find their way into a variety of products, such as tomato paste or ketchup. Most U.S. fresh tomato imports come from Mexico or Canada."

Influenza B Viruses (IBVs) infect humans in a seasonal manner and causes significant morbidity and mortality. IBVs are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a segmented genome and can be divided into two antigenically distinct lineages. The two lineages have been circulating and further evolving for almost four decades. The immune response to IBV infection can lead to antibodies that target the strain causing the infection. Some antibodies are cross-reactive and are able to bind strains from both lineages but, because of antigenic drift and immunodominance, both lineages continue to evolve and challenge human health. Here we investigate changes in the genomes of an IBVs from each lineage after passage in tissue culture in the presence of human sera containing polyclonal antibodies directed toward antigenically and temporally distinct viruses. Our previous analysis of the fourth segment, which encodes the major surface protein HA, revealed a pattern of change in which signature sequences from one lineage mutated to the signature sequences of the other lineage. Here we analyze genes from the other genomic segments and observe that most of the quasispecies’ heterogeneity occurs at the same loci in each lineage. The nature of the variants at these loci are investigated and possible reasons for this pattern are discussed. This work expands our understanding of the extent and limitations of genomic change in IBV.

Introduction An understanding of the genomes of pathogens can provide a useful context for the prevention of disease. Genomes evolve over time. They are shaped by external evolutionary pressures and constrained by internal regulatory and protein coding requirements. Influenza B viruses (IBVs) are negative strand segmented viruses and belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. The fundamental nature of influenza genomes has been described many years ago and continued research has further refined our understanding [1]. There are some differences in the genome of IBV compared to the better studied influenza A viruses. Both viruses have eight genomic segments but the number of known open reading frames (ORFs) differs. The major ORFs on each segment are analogous between influenza A and IBV genomes [2]. The three largest segments encode the polymerase subunits PB2, PB1 and PA, required for both transcription and replication [3]. The fourth and sixth segments encode the glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The fifth segment encodes the nucleoprotein [4]. The seventh segment has two ORFs encoding matrix proteins [5]. The eighth segment encodes two nonstructural proteins [6]. An additional ORF named NB was identified in the NA segment of IBV [7]. The mechanisms behind the translation of the various ORFs differ among influenza viruses, for example, the second ORF in the M segment from influenza A is translated from an mRNA splice variant but the second ORF in IBV is translated by a termination-reinitiation event [8, 9]. Several overlapping ORFs and mRNA splice variants have recently been identified in influenza A viruses [10, 11] and deep sequencing (NGS) of mRNA from IBV infected cells has also identified splice variants [12]. The overlapping genes in viruses can evolve asymmetrically with each encoded protein subject to different selection pressures [13]. IBVs can be divided into two antigenically distinct lineages [14]. These two lineages have been circulating and further evolving for almost four decades. Strains isolated prior to 1980 were genetically and serologically related [15]. The major surface proteins, HA and NA, from influenza A have been shown to work in concert [16, 17]. It was also shown that the fourth and sixth genomic segments mutate in a coordinated manner [18]. More recent knowledge of epistatic interactions in influenza A is available due to the capacity of saturation mutagenesis and deep sequencing [19]. Similar work has not yet been done for IBV. Replication of the viral genome is an imperfect process, and this is reflected in the diversity of IBV sequences in everything from clinical isolates to genetically engineered strains. Genomic mutations frequently arise due to low polymerase fidelity [20]. Viral quasispecies are present in both natural and cultivated isolates. A small study by Rutvisuttinunt et al., revealed that clinical influenza isolates had more nucleotide diversity than the cultured isolates [21]. Wasik et al., demonstrated that viruses derived from plasmids also presented as a quasispecies with low levels of variants that didn’t become fixed [22]. Both antigenic and non-antigenic changes that become fixed can affect viral fitness [23]. Some deleterious mutations (that alter receptor binding avidity, enzyme kinetics, or protein stability for example) may be compensated by epistatic mutations [17]. The loss in viral fitness or mutational load can also reduce the probability that a variant becomes fixed in the population of an infected host [24]. Our understanding of these processes and genome stability can help fuel vaccine and antiviral drug design. Antibodies are known to provide protection against disease and vaccination is a cost-effective approach to protect the population from influenza [25]. Human IgGs that target the IBV HA have been described [26–30]. The mechanism of action can include direct neutralization of viral infectivity and the engagement of host effector cells [31]. Cross-reactive antibodies generated against IBVs have been shown to be protective in vitro [32]. In addition, the differences in antibody responses toward the major antigenic sites of IBV in mice, ferrets and humans have been described [33]. Traditional influenza vaccines are designed so that antigens from the major surface proteins, HA and NA, are presented to the host and the subsequent immune response provides some level of protection [34]. However, antigenically distinct influenza viruses continue to cause disease in the human population. The variable effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines, and the pandemic potential due to some influenza viruses jumping from one species to another, has fueled the push for universal influenza vaccines that can provide protection against a broader range of viruses [35–37]. In addition to expanding the range of current vaccines, new vaccines using novel approaches are being developed. Bioinformatic tools are being used to identify epitopes which can be developed into vaccines for influenza A [38, 39]. Epitopes for M2 and NP proteins been identified as vaccine candidates and are being developed [37, 40]. Here we analyze IBV genomes to better understand how they evolve. We expand on our previous analyses of influenza B viruses passaged in tissue culture in the presence of human monoclonal antibodies. The sera were from subjects vaccinated with IBV strains that are antigenically distinct from the passaged viruses. Prior analyses revealed some sera-specific changes in which identical mutations arose in escape viruses from both lineages that altered antigenicity [41]. In addition the analyses also revealed that some changes in the HA segment made the virus from one lineage appear more like the other lineage [41]. Many of these changes were outside known antigenic sites. We postulated that such changes were limited to specific genomic loci and that genomic constraints may play a role. If true, mutations would also be constrained to specific loci in other parts of the genome not associated with antigenicity for viruses from both lineages. The current work analyzes variants present in the other segments, including those that haven’t become fixed. We provide an overview of the loci among the genomes that in which variants in the quasispecies change in frequency.  Methods The methods for virus growth, library preparation and Illumina sequencing have been described elsewhere [41]. Briefly, one Yamagata-lineage (B/Phuket/3073/2013) and one Victoria-lineage (B/Colorado/06/2017) IBV were propagated in tissue culture in the presence of sera from vaccine recipients. The viruses were passaged 1–4 times in MDCK cells [42] with sera from subjects who received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines containing either the 2003 or the 2011 Victoria-lineage IBV antigens [43]. Six different sera were used resulting in six B/Phuket/3073/2013 viruses and six B/Colorado/06/2017 escape viruses in addition to the parental viruses passaged once without sera (Table 1). The initial virus titers used for passage were 4 and 32 for B/Phuket/3073 and B/Colorado/06/2017 respectively. Higher titers were used for the Victoria-lineage virus because sera from subjects vaccinated with Victoria-lineage antigens was expected to contain higher titers of antibodies targeting Victoria-lineage IBVs. Different dilutions (1:10, 1:40 and 1:160) of serum were used and virus obtained using the least dilute serum samples was used for subsequent passages. RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA library was prepared using NEB Next Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA). The DNA fragments were ligated to Illumina paired end adaptors, amplified and purified using magnetic beads (Agencourt AMPure PCR purification system, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Deep sequencing was performed using MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The raw sequencing reads were analyzed using the High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment [HIVE: [44, 45]].

Names of viruses and sera. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239015.t001 Data for polymorphisms present at greater than 5% in the sequencing reads from each segment for all the viruses are presented in excel files (S1–S8 Files). The different types of mutation (transitions, transversion, synonymous and nonsynonymous) were identified and frequencies were calculated using the formulas available in excel. We did not include the short conserved noncoding regions at each end of the genomic segments that allow pairing of the 5’ and 3’ ends and are used in transcription and replication. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous (dN/dS) mutations was determined for each open reading frame. The results from the major ORFs were used for comparison of ratios for genomic segment.  Discussion Parallel evolution and antibodies We observed that passage of influenza B virus in tissue culture with antibodies resulted in parallel evolution in IBVs from two different lineages. Variants arose independently at the same loci in daughter populations for both the Yamagata-lineage B/PK and Victoria-lineage B/CO viruses. Parallel evolution in the HA gene has previously been observed after passage of influenza A virus in mouse lungs [53]. More in depth analyses of influenza A viruses passaged in mice demonstrated that single nucleotide variants associated with adaptation were present in all genomic segments [22, 54]. Our prior analysis of the HA gene demonstrated parallel evolution in IBV [41]. Here we interrogate the quasispecies population for each of these viruses and document parallel evolution in all the genomic segments. While the majority of the variants described did not become fixed (>50%) in the population, parallel evolution at particular loci strongly suggests evolutionary pressures are in play. Analysis of the influenza A virus genome has identified loci that are hotspots for nucleotide substitution [55]. Here we highlight loci in IBV that are more variable than other loci. In our system we observed more diversity in the B/PK strain quasispecies passaged without sera than in the B/CO strain. Although mutations arose at the same loci in both the B/PK and B/CO escape viruses, they were present in a greater proportion of the B/PK escape viruses. Also, we report more instances of decreases in the proportion of a variants in the B/PK escape virus populations, which is likely a reflection of abundance of variants in the parental virus preparations. We considered the effect the antibodies in the sera may have had on the evolution of the IBVs in our study. The sera used in this work were from subjects vaccinated in either 2003 or 2011 with trivalent inactivated vaccine containing a Victoria-lineage antigen. The sera should not contain specific antibodies toward the B/PK and B/CO viruses used in this study as they were isolated subsequently in 2013 and 2017 respectively. Passage of the Victoria-lineage B/CO in two of the sera samples from 2003 and one serum sample from 2011 resulted in large increases in single nucleotide variants across the genome (S1 Fig). Some changes to the HA gene in viruses from each lineage corelated with the sera used [41]. Here we observed a greater percentage of nonsynonymous changes in the ORFs encoding the membrane associated proteins HA, NA, M2 and NB suggesting these ORFs were more tolerant of mutation. It has been shown that different regions of the influenza A genome have a higher tolerance for mutation than others [56, 57]. However, as most of the variants in the NA, M2 and NB ORFs did not become fixed in the quasispecies population it suggests that, in our experimental setup, antibody pressure was not the only factor driving change in these segments. The changes could be the result of adaptation toward MDCK cells, or specific culture conditions such as the inclusion of sera. The MDCK cells do not have a robust Mx1 and Mx2 response to influenza and this has been correlated with changes in the polymerase and NS segments [58]. While we observed changes across these genes when viruses were propagated with sera, most would not result in nonsynonymous changes and were also present in the viral quasispecies not passaged in the presence of sera. In the polymerase genes the percentage of nucleotides and the codons with variants was higher than that for most other genes (except HA and M2) indicating more malleability of the polymerase segments (Fig 3). The percentage of variants was lower for NP indicating that the NP segment is less susceptible to mutation. Further study of convergent nonsynonymous changes may identify loci important for growth in culture, or in culture with sera. Protein coding and genomic constraints There are many constraints on the sequence of influenza A genomes. Some changes result in changes to protein coding and translation, some changes affect elements that control transcription and replication, while others may affect the stability of the genome. The ends of the RNA genomic segments of influenza viruses form secondary structures for replication [59]. Interrogation of influenza A genome codon usage has also been used to provide evidence of packaging signals [60]. Structures within the genomic segments are involved in interactions between segments [61]. It is likely that similar constraints also limit the diversity of IBV genomes. An association between RNA folding and the evolution of influenza A polymerase genes has also been demonstrated [62]. We restricted our analysis to ORFs but it is likely that many of the other genomic features overlap with the ORFs. Stochastic processes, those generating random change, do not appear to be the drivers of the genomic changes observed in our study. Our experiment used a short passage time in cell culture. This may have produced a population in which deleterious mutations were maintained by the presence of more fit members of the population [63]. The presence of antibodies may have inhibited infection of the cell culture by particular serotypes further facilitating the expansion of less genetically robust viruses. However, these explanations are insufficient to explain the range of variants observed. For example, there are many codons for which the range of synonymous codons is not sampled in the quasispecies and we did not detect variants encoding nonsense mutations. Mutational biases Considering only polymerase fidelity we would expect to see the same type of changes (transitions for example) to be distributed evenly across the genome. When Lyons & Lauring analyzed the impact selection has on the transition:transversion (ratio) bias in viruses they concluded that selection is a major contributor to the ratio [19]. Pauly et al., noted that sequencing clones results in biases toward mutations with minimal fitness impacts [64]. They determined the mutation rate for the 12 types of nucleotide substitutions in influenza. The mutation rates for the genetically engineered PR8 (H1N1) and Hong Kong 2014 (H3N2) viruses were generally biased toward transitions with higher rates for A to G and U to C. The mutation rates for the other transitions (G to A and C to U) were similar to the more common transversions (G to U, U to G and U to C). In contrast to Pauly et al. [64], we observed that A to C, C to A and A to T changes were more frequent among the transversions, and that the frequency of any transversion was lower than the transition frequencies. However, we note that none of the polymorphisms in the internal genes studied in this work became dominant in the population, nor did we analyze the frequency of the polymorphisms across the viral populations. Nonsynonymous codon changes are more frequent in the ORFs encoding the four membrane associated proteins; hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and two ion channel proteins (M2 and NB). The frequency of nonsynonymous codon changes portrayed a different pattern. The frequency was higher for the membrane protein-encoding ORFs (HA, NA, M2 and NB; 6.0–8.3%) than the other ORFs (0.8–2.4%). This correlates well with the experimental set up in which virus were propagated in the presence of antibodies. There are several ways our experimental system does not replicate natural evolution. It has been predicted that in RNA viruses, where there is a large mutational load, there may be less selection during infection [24]. However, analysis of in vivo IBV infections indicates that there are stringent bottlenecks between hosts, meaning that only a small number of viral particles were responsible for establishing the infection in a new host [65]. A similar observation was made regarding influenza A infections and many of the variants detected within hosts are not detected in viral phylogeny [66, 67]. Unlike natural infections the viral load in each passage in our experiments was controlled. This was probably more supportive of quasispecies amplification than is observed in natural infections. The viruses in our experiment did not have to deal with a sialic acid rich mucosal layer. Any bottlenecks at the infectious stage would be caused by antibodies, not mucus and the associated viral enzymatic activity. If the ratio of hemagglutinin to neuraminidase, and the respective activities, was important for infectivity it may not be accurately reflected in this system [68]. Finally, MDCK cells do not have a robust Mx1 and Mx2 response to influenza [58]. Therefore, some viruses that may have been restricted by the innate immune response in a healthy individual could have flourished in vitro. It has been hypothesized that the pyrimidine/purine content and stability of negative RNA virus genomes in complex with the nucleoprotein modulates the polymerase activity, and this then affects which loci are subject to mutation [69]. A corollary to this is that NP would tolerate fewer mutations. In this work we observed relatively few nucleotide changes to the NP segment and a low dN/dS ratio which suggests using the IBV NP for vaccine development might be a good approach. Research in mice has shown that mucosal vaccination using recombinant adenovirus encoding IBV nucleoprotein provided protection against both IBV lineages and influenza A virus [70]. Additional vaccines using conserved IBV NP epitopes are being developed [71]. The ectodomain of the M2 protein is a conserved protein across influenza A viruses making it a good target for a universal vaccine [72]. There are universal vaccines in the clinical trial phase that use both the NP and M2 proteins from influenza A [37, 40]. In IBV there is a second ORF in the NA segment that encodes a redundant protein analogous to M2 [73]. Here we report higher dN/dS ratios for the M2 and NB ORFs compared to the other IBV ORFs which may indicate that these IBV proteins are not ideal targets for a universal vaccine. The methodology of our study presents some advantages and disadvantages. We have focused on two viruses passaged in cell culture and do not know if the quasispecies of other IBVs are similar. We have information about the genomes of these virus after passage with and without sera and have been able to document parallel evolution. Some of this evolution is likely due to the presence of antibodies during viral passage but there is no clear relationship between each of the variants described and the growth conditions. Therefore, we cannot definitively classify them as culture-induced or antibody-induced mutations. We have cataloged the presence of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in the viral populations. Knowledge about which minor variants are present in the parental viral strains provides an indication of what changes are possible even if they don’t become dominant. However, this makes it difficult to link changes in variant frequency to selective pressure. Variants not present in the parental strain that emerge are likely to be under strong selective pressure, whereas variants that fluctuate in frequency are likely to be under neutral pressure. Lastly, we do not investigate epistatic relationships here. Most of the polymorphisms described in this work did not become fixed and passage of the viruses at a low MOI would be required to identify epistatic relationships or mutations that improve viral fitness.  Conclusion This analysis of NGS data from IBVs from different lineages grown in culture in the presence of human sera provides insight about the constraints associated with IBV genome mutation. We hypothesize that variants are limited to certain loci because features of the genome prevent other mutations from arising. The presence of reciprocal variants in viruses from two different lineages, and the fixation of some of the variants as positively selected codons in natural isolates, or as trunk mutations on phylogenetic trees in contemporary and historical isolates, support this hypothesis. Further experimental testing of this hypothesis is warranted. Our data also indicates that some selective pressures apply to the whole genome while others only to certain genomic segments or parts of segments. This is exemplified by the difference in frequency of variants and the different dN/dS ratios for M1 and M2 which reside on the same genomic segment. The complexities associated with negative strand RNA virus replication make further dissection of these selective pressures difficult. However, our analysis does suggest that data mining, taking into account the experimentally demonstrated constraints on IBV genomes, may help in the design of new vaccines or antivirals.

Until recently, it was also home to an upstart political party headed by the company’s 41-year-old heir, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. On the fifth floor, he and the fresh-faced activists of the Future Forward Party (FFP) would hold boisterous press conferences and hushed policy meetings. They gained 17% of the vote in last year’s general election despite being barely a year old.  That remarkable showing should have thrust 81 FFP lawmakers into Thailand’s 750-seat National Assembly. But the political establishment struck back. First, Thanathorn was banned from politics over shares he allegedly held in a media company. (Thai law says electoral candidates cannot hold such shares; Thanathorn insists they had been transferred to his mother.) Then, on Feb. 21, the party was dissolved over alleged funding irregularities. The legal action was described as “politically motivated” by Human Rights Watch. With it, the political will of 6.3 million voters was snuffed out.  Sitting down with TIME in the week before that decision, Thanathorn was sanguine. Over the past two decades, populist governments in Thailand have been removed from power twice by the military and three times by the courts. The FFP may have been a long way from Government House but the power nexus centered around the palace, the courts and the military was evidently spooked.  “The Future Forward Party is a vehicle, but even if they dissolve us, we will continue the journey,” shrugged Thanathorn at the time. “This year, I’m sure, with me leading, or otherwise, we’ll return to public demonstrations.”  That’s to be expected. In the parlance of travel marketing, Thailand has long been sold as the Land of Smiles, but it could just as fairly be called the Land of Protests or Country of Coups. The Southeast Asian nation of 70 million has gone through seven attempted and 12 successful coups over the past century, while recent years have been punctuated by color-coded street protests aimed at paralyzing the sprawling capital. (Urban and southern royalists typically don yellow; rural voters from populous, rice-growing northern provinces wear red.)  Today, people are taking to the street once again. Clad in face masks, and flashing the three-fingered Hunger Games salute to the sound of Thai rap, thousands of protesters have thronged the capital over recent months, demanding political reform of a military-backed government seen as bungling and corrupt. While political grievances have festered for decades, “the FFP dissolution was the last straw,” says Thitinan Pongsudhirak, associate professor of political science at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University.  In terms of numbers, these are the biggest demonstrations since those preceding the 2014 coup d’état. In their ambition, however, they are unprecedented. Protesters have drawn up a 10-point manifesto that includes reform of the sacrosanct royal family and an overhaul of political institutions including a new constitution and elections. Coup leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha—now serving as prime minister, largely owing to a new constitution dictated by the military—warned last month that the protesters “really went too far.”  University and high school students are in the vanguard. Thitinan hasn’t seen anything like it in 27 years of academia. “The students feel empowered, they are wide awake, pay more attention, nobody’s falling asleep in class,” he says. “It’s astonishing for me, personally, as a teacher.”  Young Thais are also being galvanized by the pandemic, given the damage to Thailand’s tourism-reliant economy, which is forecast to shrink by 8-10% this year—the sharpest contraction in Southeast Asia. Coronavirus’ role in stoking the protests has “been huge, as people don’t see a future,” Thanathorn says. “The anger is there. It’s waiting to burst.”  Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit of Thailand's progressive Future Forward Party gestures to his supporters at a rally in Bangkok, Thailand on Dec. 14, 2019. Soe Zeya—Reuters  ‘It’s divide and conquer’  Instability in Thailand matters. It is America’s oldest ally in Asia and has served as a bulwark to more authoritarian, left-leaning neighbors ever since the Thai establishment, backed by Washington, constructed a national identity and cult of personality around Massachusetts-born King Bhumibol Adulyadej. During the 60s and 70s, huge posters of Bhumibol, paid for by American taxpayers, were distributed across the country to help win over hearts and minds in the face of a communist insurgency. But as the Cold War thawed, Bhumibol’s influence faded along with his health. By the time of his death in 2016, he remained an object of veneration for ordinary Thais but his role had morphed from a guarantor of political stability to underwriter of enormous wealth for courtiers and brass hats.  The latter still grip the levers of power. In the diplomatic vacuum left by the isolationist America First policy of President Trump, the junta has pushed Thailand towards China. Bangkok and Beijing have inked joint development projects and arms purchases, and the Thais have repatriated Chinese dissidents with scant regard to due process.  “As Washington condemned the [2014] coup and the junta cracked down on dissent, Beijing sidled up with infrastructure funding deals and promises of no-strings support,” says Sebastian Strangio, author of In the Dragon’s Shadow: Southeast Asia in the Chinese Century.  Meanwhile the relationship between palace and army continues to be extremely close (Thai historian Thak Chaloemtiarana calls it “despotic paternalism”) and the stock justification for every military intervention remains “protection of the monarchy.” Thanathorn is not alone when he says the generals are responsible for Thailand’s cycle of protests and coups.  “We have enough evidence to show that a military-sponsored information operation installs hatred into society,” he says. “It’s divide and conquer.”  The military is getting richer in the process, controlling golf courses, horse-racing tracks and muay Thai stadiums. It owns hotel chains, conference centers, free trade zones and even TV and radio stations. In parliament, the 81 senators who are also generals have an average wealth of 78 million baht ($2.5 million) each, but 40 years of a general’s official earnings amounts to 48 million baht ($1.5 million)—and that’s assuming not a satang (or penny) is spent. According to legislative documents obtained by the FFP, Thailand’s military had off-budget spending of 18 billion baht ($580,000,000) last year.  “It’s a state within a state,” says Thanathorn. “Even MPs cannot see through their budgets, cannot audit income [and] expenses. Imagine if we used this money for schools and hospitals.”  On Feb. 8 and 9, the venality turned deadly. In Korat, a city 180 miles northeast of Bangkok, a soldier went on a killing spree that claimed 29 lives and wounded 58 others. The deadliest mass shooting in Thailand’s history began with the 31-year-old perpetrator slaying a superior officer, as well as the officer’s mother-in-law, whom he accused of cheating him in a lucrative land deal. He was eventually cornered in a shopping mall and killed. “Rich from cheating and taking advantage of people” he posted online during the rampage. “Do they think they can take money to spend in hell?”  In the wake of national mourning, reforms were promised. Still, in a tearful address, Thailand’s top general, Apirat Kongsompong, referred to the military as a “sacred” institution.  “What the hell? It’s a freaking army,” says Tony Davis, a Bangkok-based security analyst for IHS-Janes. “Every country needs one but do your job properly instead of floundering around in business activities.”  For Thanathorn, Korat offered “the best opportunity in 100 years” to push for reform. “We should not let those families suffer for nothing.”  A Bangkok inscription on a sky train bridge is seen through the hole of a banner during a commemoration of the anniversary of the 1932 revolution which ended absolute monarchy with heavily symbolic events in Bangkok on June 24, 2020, demanding reforms to a political system dominated by the arch-royalist army. Mladen Antonov—AFP/Getty Images  ‘He’s pressing all the buttons’  Despite his considerable wealth, Thanathorn has long been an iconoclast. His uncle served as minister of transport between 2002 and 2005 and is now a senior figure in Thailand’s biggest pro-military party, but Thanathorn insists his family were always outsiders. His grandfather emigrated to Thailand from southern China’s Fujian province in the early 20th century. In 1977, Thanathorn’s father started Thai Summit, and he says he grew up in a middle-class household, walking or taking the bus to class like his peers. It wasn’t until high school that the family firm started booming on the strength of lucrative contracts with Japanese auto firms, beginning its transformation into an empire with $2.5 billion in annual revenue.  “That’s when I could see the gap between me and my friends,” Thanathorn says.  It’s also when Thailand’s glass ceiling became apparent. “When we began having wealth, my parents wanted to be recognized, to be one of the elite,” he says. “They tried to donate, to mingle with politicians and people in power. But we learned no matter how much we tried, we cannot be one of them, because we are new rich. So my parents stopped trying.”  But they refused to spoil the princeling. From the age of ten, Thanathorn was sent during school holidays to toil in restaurants, washing dishes and scrubbing floors. At a hotel, he lugged bags and cleaned rooms. He loaded pallets of goods onto sooty trucks at a warehouse.  “I wasn’t very happy about it at the time,” he laughs, “but I learned the gap between rich and poor. But back then, I didn’t think that it was structural. I didn’t know whether this gap was about opportunities or individual performance.”  It was while studying mechanical engineering at Bangkok’s Thammasat University that he had an awakening. “In my second year, I went to a slum in Bangkok for the first time,” he says, “My thinking changed drastically because I saw the social struggle.”  Thanathorn became a student activist for progressive causes, campaigning for issues like compensation for those evicted to make way for state development projects. Then he studied at Nottingham University in the U.K., where he became involved with the student branch of the far-left Socialist Workers Party. “I learned the way they mobilize, the way they organize,” he says. Afterward, a joint masters in global finance between Hong Kong University and NYU beckoned.  For Thanathorn, those studies laid bare the realities of Thailand’s kleptocratic economy. Minimal property taxes mean the rich can sit on huge assets, while many sectors are sealed off from competition. For example, craft breweries have sprung up across the world to cater for a new generation of beer fans. In Thailand, however, selling small-batch brew is banned under a decades-old law that shields two huge family-run corporations, which monopolize 90% of a $5.7-billion market. And while in most countries, several duty-free concessions are assigned for commercial airports—Seoul’s Incheon International Airport has a dozen—in Thailand, one firm with close government ties has been awarded the sole concession to Bangkok’s main airports for over two decades without formal bids, creating a multi-billion-dollar family empire from scratch. In Thailand, “you create billionaires within one generation without innovation or anything,” says Thanathorn.  After completing his studies, Thanathorn had plans to pursue a career in international development with the U.N. But following his father’s death from cancer in 2002, he returned to Thailand to assume leadership of Thai Summit at just 23, helming it for 17 years until he founded the FFP.  His political style wasn’t without detractors. Many disagreed with Thanathorn’s abrasive tactics, such as his public shaming of senior establishment figures—not done under Thailand’s strict social codes.  “He’s pressing all the buttons that are guaranteed to rile [the elite] instead of framing the problem in a manner which they cannot dispute,” says Davis.  Even those who have built a career out of needling the establishment harbor doubts. The political artist Headache Stencil—dubbed “Thailand’s Banksy,” says “Thanathorn is more like a revolutionary than a political leader … But he can shepherd the transition to someone else who is calmer and more suited to lead.”  But large numbers of voters were won over by the self-styled “billionaire commoner” with the sharp, handsome features and boy-band spiky hair. According to a late 2019 poll by the National Institute of Development Administration, 31% of respondents tabbed Thanathorn as best qualified to be prime minister, with Prayut named by just 23%.  Protesters perform a 'Hunger Games' three finger salute during anti-government demonstration in Bangkok on Aug. 16, 2020. Jonas Gratzer—LightRocket/Getty Images  ‘Thailand’s inconvenient truth’  Father to four young children, Thanathorn professes a love of reading everything from Khaled Hosseini to Game of Thrones. “I preferred the books to the TV series,” he says.  There is certainly no end of palace intrigue in Thailand. After a string of scandals—and with his lavish, eccentric lifestyle—King Maha Vajiralongkorn, Bhumibol’s son, has failed to command the same respect as his father. The four-times married, former Air Force pilot once promoted his pet poodle, Fu-Fu, to the rank of Air Chief Marshall. Since ascending the throne, he’s consolidated power while spending much of his time overseas. In 2017, the King introduced a new salute and haircut for the armed forces to match those of his own bodyguards. That same year, a 1936 law was amended to give him full control of the Crown Property Bureau, which manages the palace’s estimated $30 billion fortune. Last October, he ordered the transfer of two prestigious army units to his direct command, making them an effective “praetorian guard,” says Davis.  On Sept. 2, reports emerged that the King’s former consort, Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi—who last year was arrested, stripped of all royal titles and had her family home demolished for disloyalty—was suddenly deemed “untainted” and had her privileges restored. The hashtags #FreeOfBlemish and #ReformTheMonarchy were top trends on Twitter in Thailand after the news broke.  “The King’s treatment of Sineenat as a possession, put away and taken out at his will, is one of many reasons why protesters in Thailand have broached the taboo topic of the monarchy,” says Tamara Loos, professor of history and Thai studies at Cornell University.  That such lurid plots play out against the backdrop of Thailand’s worst economic crisis since 1997 incenses young Thais. Unbound by the same existential fear of creeping communism as their parents and grandparents, today’s youth demand a more equitable society. But the Thai monarch is protected by what are considered the world’s harshest royal defamation laws—known as lèse majesté or Section 112—that carry a penalty of 15 years in prison, and which have increasingly been used to quash dissent.  On June 4, a Thai democracy activist, Wanchalearm Satsaksit, was kidnapped in Cambodia and is believed murdered. He was on a government list of 29 exiled activists accused of violating Section 112, of whom at least eight have disappeared or been discovered dead. The situation inside Thailand is also deteriorating. On 9 July, a man from Thailand’s northeast was thrown into a psychiatric hospital for wearing a shirt emblazoned with, “I’ve lost faith in the institution of the monarchy.” One protest leader, human rights lawyer Anon Nampa, who has been outspoken in calling for royal reform, has been arrested three times in recent weeks and charged with sedition. “Thailand’s inconvenient truth” is how Thanathorn describes co-option of the royal institution.  “Let me be clear about this: reforming the monarchy does not equal abolishing the monarchy,’ he says. “It’s the powers and goals of the monarchy that don’t suit the principle of democracy that have to be changed.”  Thanathorn says he and the current protesters “share the same ideas about the future of the country” but have chosen different paths—within the system and outside it. His ban from politics means he cannot stand for election, though a loophole has seen him appointed by sympathetic lawmakers to a budget scrutiny committee, which has already trimmed $1 billion from the books, including the cancellation of two Chinese-built submarines for the military. Thanathorn has also broken a taboo by openly questioning the royal budget.  It’s a risky strategy. The government still holds all the cards, including the backing of the parliament, military, palace and judiciary. Thanathorn has already been charged with seeking to abolish the monarchy and sedition, though was acquitted on both counts. Other than disappeared and caged activists, in recent years two anti-establishment Thai prime ministers have been forced into exile and convicted in absentia on charges they claim were politically motivated. Thanathorn insists he won’t flee his homeland even if it means jail—or worse.  “So be it, I’m not afraid,” he says. “If I don’t do this, I don’t see anyone else doing it.”  Get The Brief.

We enrolled 243 patients with acute dengue-like illness: 71.2% were dengue infections confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR or NS1 antigen capture ELISA, of which 87.2% and 9.0% of DF cases were respectively classified DWWS and SD, and 35.9% of DHF were designated SD using an adapted WHO 2009 classification for SD case definition. Systematic use of ultrasound at patient admission was crucial for detecting plasma leakage. No difference was observed in the concentration of secreted NS1 protein between different dengue severity groups. Lipid profiles were different between DWWS and SD at admission, characterized by a decrease in total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol, in SD.  The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed guidelines on dengue clinical classification in 1997 and more recently in 2009 for the clinical management of patients. The WHO 1997 classification defines three categories of dengue infection according to severity: dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Alternative WHO 2009 guidelines provide a cross-sectional classification aiming to discriminate dengue fever from dengue with warning signs (DWWS) and severe dengue (SD). The primary objective of this study was to perform a comparison of two dengue classifications. The secondary objective was to describe the changes of hematological and biochemical parameters occurring in patients presenting with different degrees of severity during the course of the disease, since progression to more severe clinical forms is unpredictable.  Dengue is a viral disease that results in various health conditions, ranging from strictly asymptomatic infections to life-threatening severe dengue. Here we have compared the two World Health Organization (WHO) dengue classification schemes from 1997 and 2009, which define different categories of dengue fever and have been at the root of much debate in the dengue research community. We enrolled a Cambodian pediatric cohort of hospitalized dengue-confirmed patients, with clinical and biological follow-up. Our findings demonstrate that (i) the WHO 1997 classification is a longitudinal dengue-case classification which uses strict prerequisite clinical and/or biological signs to move from one level of severity to another, and (ii) the WHO 2009 classification, being a transversal dengue-case classifier, is more flexible and when adapted with systematic use of ultrasound is more accurate in identifying severe dengue case for timely and appropriate clinical management of hospitalized patients. Our laboratory results found that lipid profiles exhibited changes and differences between different dengue severity groups at hospital.  Competing interests: I have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: Dr. Philippe Buchy is a former Head of Virology at Institut Pasteur du Cambodge and is currently an employee of GSK Vaccines, Singapore. The other authors have declared that no competing interests exist.  Thus, the primary objective of the current study is to perform a comparison of the two dengue classification schemes–using an adapted WHO 2009 classification for SD case definition–in a cross-sectional cohort of Cambodian children aged from 2 to 15 years old, hospitalized in Kampong Cham province hospital with confirmed dengue, and benefiting from clinical and biological follow-ups. The secondary objective is to describe in detail the changes of hematological and biochemical parameters–including lipid profiles–occurring in children presenting with different degrees of dengue disease severity at hospital admittance and during the course of their illness.  The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed the first guidelines on dengue with a clinical classification in 1974, later revised in 1997 [ 13 , 14 ]. This WHO 1997 classification scheme, which comprises three categories–dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS)–is based on prerequisite clinical and/or biological signs to correctly classify the degree of severity of the disease [ 15 , 16 ]. However, as dengue case rates increased and the disease became widespread in Asia and the Americas, many clinicians confronted with the full spectrum of dengue encountered difficulties in applying WHO 1997 case definitions for triage and clinical management [ 15 – 18 ]. Subsequent prospective clinical studies aimed to improve dengue case management [ 19 , 20 ], and the WHO launched new case management guidelines in 2009 (WHO 2009), which instead of being longitudinal (previous step required before passing to next step), provided a cross-sectional classification of dengue cases that established criteria to identify dengue cases with warning signs (DWWS) or severe dengue (SD) [ 21 ]. Deciding which of these significantly different classification schemes (WHO 1997 or WHO 2009) clinicians should rely on has been a stumbling block in dengue fever research ever since. Several studies using different methods and datasets to compare the two schemes have been published [ 19 , 20 , 22 – 26 ].  Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The global affected population is estimated at 390 million individuals across more than 100 countries, with about 70% of infections occurring in Asia [ 1 ]. This disease, formerly limited to tropical or sub-tropical areas, is now reaching new regions with temperate or Mediterranean climates [ 2 – 5 ]. Dengue virus (DENV) belongs to the genus Flavivirus and comprises four distinct serotypes: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 [ 6 ]. Infection by one of the four serotypes results in short-term heterotypic immunity. Moreover, although reinfections with the same serotype have been reported [ 7 ], serotype-specific immunity is usually considered to be lifelong. Progression to more serious disease is frequently, but not exclusively, associated with secondary infection by heterologous serotypes [ 8 ]. The clinical characteristics of dengue are wide-ranging, from mild conditions to life-threatening symptoms. More rarely, atypical occurrences of dengue virus infection may involve fulminant hepatitis, cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, and encephalopathy [ 9 – 12 ]. The course of the disease can be divided into three phases: (i) acute febrile phase lasting 2 to 7 days with non-specific clinical signs and possible mild hemorrhagic symptoms (petechial and mucosal bleeding), (ii) critical phase generally occurring at the time of defervescence, during which complications may appear in a small proportion of patients, including severe hemorrhage, plasma leakage with shock, and organ impairment, and (iii) recovery phase. Early and appropriate management of dengue cases with severe symptoms is a key step in reducing mortality [ 6 ].  Third, a comparison of laboratory findings was conducted between dengue case groups using the WHO 1997 and adapted WHO 2009 dengue case definitions. Depending on the variable being examined, t-tests, Mann-Whitney tests, or one-way ANOVA (followed by Tukey's test if necessary) were used to evaluate statistically significant differences. No corrections for multiple testing were made, but a more stringent p-value cut-off was used for to consider significance (p<0.01) in this article.  Second, differences in demographics (gender and age), dengue immune status, laboratory evidence of dengue infection, and hospitalization duration of acute dengue-infected children included in the study across the subgroups of both the WHO 1997 and adapted WHO 2009 dengue classification schemes (n = 173), were tested for statistical significance. Fisher exact tests were used to test categorical variables and one-way ANOVA or Kruskall-Wallis tests for continuous variables.  First, acute dengue infection (DI, n = 173), other arbovirus infection (OAI, n = 33), and non-dengue infection (NDI, n = 37) subgroups were compared. Fisher exact tests were used to test categorical variables, and one-way ANOVA (or non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis tests for non-Gaussian data) to test continuous variables. If the one-way ANOVA or Kruskall-Wallis test was significant (p<0.01), post-hoc Tukey tests were used to investigate which pairwise differences were significant.  The severity of the disease among confirmed dengue patients was assessed according to the WHO 1997 and WHO 2009 criteria using clinical, biological and ultrasound data recorded at admission, defervescence and discharge. As per the WHO 1997 case definition, patients were classed into three groups: dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [ 14 ]. In addition, patients were classified according to WHO 2009 classification criteria, separating dengue cases into severe dengue and non-severe dengue. Non-severe dengue patients were divided into two subgroups: patients with warning signs (DWWS) and those without (D-nonWS). DWWS was defined as an association of clinical signs with laboratory findings. Moreover, clinical fluid accumulation (pleural effusion and ascites fluid) and liver enlargement were evaluated using ultrasonographic examination. We adapted WHO 2009 classification by using ultrasound that gave us the opportunity to semi-quantify the degree of fluid accumulation, providing a more accurate clinical diagnosis in discriminating between DWWS and severe dengue (SD): (i) minimal amount of liquid was considered as mild plasma leakage i.e. a warning sign (DWWS); (ii) moderate or abundant amount of liquid was considered as severe dengue, possibly leading to aggravation with respiratory distress (SD). Both classifications were applied after the final assessment using all available biological and clinical information. See S1 Appendix for a detailed description of the classification criteria.  Other arbovirus infections were defined as follows: acute Chikungunya infections were diagnosed by positive RT-PCR [ 35 ] or CHIV-specific IgM seroconversion [ 36 ]; acute dengue and Chikungunya coinfection was diagnosed by positive RT-PCR for both viruses; recent infection was characterized by detection of IgM antibodies against DENV, JEV or flavivirus (detection of both anti-DENV and anti-JEV antibodies) and/or CHIKV ( S1 Table ). Patients were classified as non-dengue when laboratory tests showed no presence of virus RNA by RT-qPCR or NS1 antigen by capture ELISA, and no presence or a fourfold increase of DENV-specific antibodies by MAC-ELISA or HI assay, respectively ( S1 Table ). Finally, the severity of the disease among confirmed dengue patients was assessed according to the WHO 1997 and WHO 2009 criteria using clinical, biological and ultrasound data recorded at admission, defervescence and discharge [ 14 , 21 ].  DENV infection of hospitalized patients was confirmed by NS1 antigen detection using the capture ELISA assay described by Andries et al. [ 29 ] and/or by RT-qPCR and/or virus isolation on Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells on the plasma sample obtained at Visit 1 [ 29 , 30 ] and/or DENV-specific IgM seroconversion and/or a fourfold increase in the titer of total antibodies using the HI assay in paired acute and convalescent sera [ 21 ] ( S1 Table ). Considering that Cambodia is highly endemic for DENV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [ 31 , 32 ], and due to potential cross-reactivity among flaviviruses and the presence of other arboviruses, all sera collected during the acute and convalescent phases of infection, respectively Visits 1 and 3, were tested for anti-DENV, anti-JEV, and anti-Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), using an in-house IgM capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay as previously described [ 33 , 34 ]. Dengue immune status, distinguishing between primary and secondary infection, was determined using WHO guidelines [ 14 ]: primary infections were characterized by the presence or absence of HI antibodies in acute-phase samples and by low titers with a 4-fold rise of HI antibodies (≤ 1:1,280) in serum from the convalescence phase with an elapsed time of at least 7 days between admission (Visit 1) and discharge samples (Visit 3). Conversely, secondary infections were defined by the presence of HI antibodies in acute-phase samples and by high titers with a 4-fold rise of HI antibodies (≥ 1:2,560) in serum from the convalescence phase. However, when the elapsed time between the admission and discharge samples was not optimal; i.e., less than 7 days, all admission samples collected within the first three days after symptoms onset with negative HI titers associated to discharged samples with HI titers ≤ 1,280 were considered as primary infections.  In order to assess a patient's clinical and biological evolution towards either a possible recovery phase or critical phase–characterized mainly by an increase of capillary permeability in parallel with increasing hematocrit level [ 21 ]–patients were followed during their hospitalization until having 2 days without fever, with daily clinical examination and serial hematocrit and platelet counts recorded. Defervescence was characterized as having no fever for 48 hours. In the meantime, ultrasonographic examinations of the abdomen and chest were also systematically performed at admission, defervescence, and discharge to identify either a recovery phase or any evidence of mild or severe plasma leakage possibly for evidence of a critical phase or severe dengue.  For all included patients, whole blood was collected in two tubes with EDTA anticoagulant shortly after admission (Visit 1), at defervescence (Visit 2), and at discharge (Visit 3). The volume drawn was adapted according to participant weight: 3.0 mL for children below 20 kg, and 5.0 mL for those over 20 kg [ 27 ]. One tube from each visit was processed by the laboratory at Kampong Cham Hospital for initial blood tests. The other tube and the remaining blood from the first tube were sent with ice packs to the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (in Phnom Penh) within 5–10 hours for complementary analyses including lipid profiles (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and calculated LDL cholesterol), C-reactive protein (CRP), total and conjugated bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and dengue diagnosis as described below. The total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides levels were measured using the COBAS INTEGRA 400 plus analyzer (Roche Diagnostics. Meylan, France) as part of a clinical laboratory routine. We did not measure the LDL cholesterol level directly in our study cohort, but instead used the calculation method previously defined by Freidwald et al. based on total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels [ 28 ].  We performed a prospective, monocentric, cross-sectional study of hospitalized children with severe and non-severe dengue. The first visit was conducted at admission (Visit 1). The day of onset of symptoms was defined as day 0 of the illness. Visit 2 was conducted at the defervescence phase, which is characterized as the first day with temperature ≤ 38 °C in the absence of antipyretic intake. Finally, Visit 3 was performed and considered the pre-discharge/discharge visit for patients who recovered entirely, or a follow-up visit for patients in the critical phase. A clinical and biological follow-up was conducted at each visit as described below.  Patients presenting with acute dengue-like illness during two consecutive dengue epidemic seasons–between June and October of 2011 and 2012 –were enrolled at Kampong Cham Referral Hospital. Inclusion criteria, following the WHO 1997 classification scheme, were: children between 2 and 15 years old who had fever or history of fever at presentation and onset within previous days of at least two of the following symptoms: headache, retro-orbital pain, muscle pain, joint pain, rash, or any bleeding signs. Exclusion criteria were symptoms inconsistent with dengue, obvious non-dengue acute infections (e.g., otitis media, pneumonia, meningitis), or a known chronic illness.  The current study was conducted in the field in the Cambodian context in a real life setting, where the day of hospitalization with respect to onset of disease was quite variable ( Table 1 ). This situation is not uncommon in many countries where dengue is endemic. Hence, we were interested in evaluating various biochemical parameters at hospital admission rather than day of illness in order to inform clinicians working in these settings. The comparison of the evolution of lipid profile parameters from visit to visit in the DI and NDI groups is shown in S4 and S5 Figs. Working under the adapted WHO 2009 classification scheme, total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels in the DI and NDI groups all evolved in a similar way over time, first with low values compared to the normal, then gradually moving back up towards the normal. As for triglycerides, their levels were elevated at admission with compared to the normal, tending to rise higher at defervescence before gradually dropping back towards the normal. Similar trends were observed between the DF, DHF, and DSS groups as between DWWS and SD ( S6 and S7 Figs).  Recent studies have reported that host lipids like cholesterol are modulated by flaviviruses during infection in mammals, and that changes in lipid profiles are associated with severe forms of dengue in humans [ 38 , 39 ]. A comparison of lipid parameters over the hospitalization period provided significant results: the mean total cholesterol in SD patients (2.5 mmol/L) was below the lower normal range (i.e., <3 mmol/L) early in the disease course (day 3–6) and significantly below the mean total cholesterol in DWWS patients (3.1 mmol/L, 95% CI: 3.0–3.2, p = 7.8e-12, t-test) over the same period ( Fig 3 ). A similar pattern was observed for HDL cholesterol, with even more striking differences. Mean HDL cholesterol values were below the lower normal range (<1 mmol/L) for both categories across all days after symptoms onset. In addition, HDL cholesterol in SD patients (0.33 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.30–0.36) was significantly below that of DWWS patients (0.58 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.55–0.62, p<1e-15 Mann-Whitney test) for the pooled data from days 3–7 ( Fig 3 ). In parallel, the mean LDL cholesterol in SD patients (0.92 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.81–1.0) was significantly below that in the DWWS patients (1.6 mmol/L, 95% CI: 1.5–1.7, p = 4.4e-14, Mann-Whitney test) in pooled data over days 3–6 ( Fig 3 ). Triglycerides behaved differently, with means increasing above the upper normal range (i.e., >1.7 mmol/L) during hospitalization in DWWS and SD patient groups after 4 days of symptoms ( Fig 3 ). The mean triglycerides levels pooled over days 1–5 in DWWS (1.7 mmol/L, 95% CI: 1.5–1.8) and SD (2.7 mmol/L, 95% CI: 2.4–3.1) patients were significantly different (p = 1.7e-9, Mann-Whitney test).  Values at admission, deferverscence and discharge for: dengue with warning signs (DWWS; green circles), severe dengue (SD; pink squares). Liver function: ( A ) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT; IU/L); ( B ) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST; IU/L); Lipid profile: ( C ) Total cholesterol (mmol/L); ( D ) HDL cholesterol (mmol/L); ( E ) Calculated LDL cholesterol (mmol/L); ( F ) Triglycerides (mmol/L). Each circle or square represents the mean of each variable's observed values per day. Error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals around the mean. Grey areas represent the normal range for each parameter. Normal ranges used for biochemical parameters were obtained from: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2172316-overview .  We evaluated differences in the most impacted biochemical parameters along the course of dengue illness between different dengue severity groups. For liver function, the mean ALT in SD patients was significantly higher than for DWWS patients over days 1–3 pooled together. Furthermore, combining all admission days (1–14), the mean ALT was twice the upper normal range (63 IU/L, 95% CI: 56–69) in DWWS patients and was significantly higher than this in SD patients, with a mean three times the upper normal range (96 IU/L, 95% CI: 81–112; p = 7.3e-10, Mann-Whitney test). Similarly, the mean AST in SD patients was significantly higher than for DWWS patients over days 1–4, and the mean AST in DWWS and SD patients over combined days 1–14 were four (124 IU/L, 95% CI: 113–135) and eight (239 IU/L, 95% CI: 201–278; p<1e-15, Mann-Whitney test) times the upper normal range, respectively ( Fig 3 ). As for the WHO 1997 classification, combining days 1–14, the mean ALT was twice the upper normal range (57 IU/L, 95% CI: 49–65) in DF patients and was significantly higher in DHF/DSS patients combined, with a mean around three times the upper normal range (85 IU/L, 95% CI: 75–95; p = 7e-10, Mann-Whitney test). The mean AST in DF and DHF/DSS patients over combined days 1–14 were three (114 IU/L, 95% CI: 100–127) and more than six times the upper normal range (194 IU/L, 95% CI: 170–217), respectively ( S3 Fig ), and this difference was significant (p = 5e-15, Mann-Whitney test).

Each circle or square represents the mean of each variable's observed values per day. Error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals around the mean. Grey areas represent the normal range for each parameter. Normal ranges used for hematological parameters were obtained for children aged from 2 to 15 years old from: http://www.hematocell.fr/index.php/les-cellules-du-sang/15-les-cellules-du-sang-et-de-la-moelle-osseuse/valeurs-normales-de-lhemogramme-selon-lage/129-hemogramme-selon-lage .  A decrease in platelet count and increased hematocrit concentrations are included in both the WHO 1997 and adapted WHO 2009 classification criteria. Here, we investigated to what extend they separate differently classified patients and which dynamics they follow over time in the various patient populations. The mean platelet count pooled over days 3–6 in SD patients (51x10 9 /L, 95% CI: 41–61) was significantly below that of DWWS (106x10 9 /L, 95% CI: 96–116; p = 5.4e-14, Mann-Whitney test; Fig 2 ). Moreover, both means were below the platelet lower normal range (<160x10 9 /L). Additionally, the mean platelet count pooled over days 3–6 in DHF/DSS patients (62x10 9 /L, 95% CI: 54–71) was significantly below that of DF (127x10 9 /L, 95% CI: 115–139; p<1e-15, Mann-Whitney test– S2 Fig ).  We evaluated differences in viral load and NS1 concentration at admission between different dengue severity groups ( Fig 1 and S1 Fig ). Here, the mean viral load pooled over days 3–5 in SD patients (4.5 Log 10 copy/mL, 95% CI: 3.8–5.2) was lower than in DWWS patients. Additionally, the average NS1 concentration pooled over days 1–14 in SD patients was lower than in DWWS patients. Considering the WHO 1997 classification, there was no difference in viral load at any day after onset of symptoms. The NS1 concentration pooled over the whole range of admission days (day 1–14) was significantly lower in DHF/DSS patients (5.6 μg/mL, 95% CI: 3.3–7.8) than in DF patients (5.8 μg/mL, 95% CI: 4.3–7.3; p = 1.1e-3; S1 Fig ).  Finally, among all SD (n = 52) classified with adapted WHO 2009 by using ultrasound, all but 2 patients (96%) presented plasma leakage characterized by at least moderate or abundant pleural effusion at one or two visits, associated or not with plasma leakage based on hematocrit fluctuation, signs of shock or severe organ involvement. Description of biological (i.e. plasma leakage based on hematocrit fluctuation) and clinical manifestations among SD is presented in Table 6 .  A pre-discharge/discharge visit for patients who recovered entirely, or a follow-up visit for patients in the critical phase, corresponded to Visit 3. Table 5 presents the distribution of dengue patients in the critical phase at Visit 3 with follow-up, according to their WHO 1997 and adapted WHO 2009 dengue classifications. Among all DI (n = 173), 39 (22.5%) had a follow-up visit; this corresponded to 87.1% of the DHF/DSS patients, and 53.8% of the SD ones. Of note, Visit 3 follow-ups for patients in the critical phase usually occurred earlier than for discharged ones.  In the set of DHF patients (n = 78) as classified by the WHO 1997 classification scheme, 28 (35.9%) presented clinical signs of SD, including pleural effusion–quantified by ultrasound as moderate or abundant (n = 26)–and/or elevated AST, over 1000 IU/L (n = 2). The 50 (64.1%) remaining DHF cases were identified as DWWS using the WHO 2009 case definition. Clinical warning signs were observed in at least 44 children at Visit 1 and in 4 additional patients at Visit 2. Using ultrasound, 43 patients had fluid accumulation: ascites fluid alone (n = 19), ascites associated with pleural effusion (n = 17), or isolated pleural effusion (n = 7), were observed during at least one visit. Additionally, an increase in hematocrit above the normal range, concurrent with thrombocytopenia, was observed in 8 patients at different time points: Visit 1 (n = 4) and Visit 2 (n = 4). Finally, a drop in platelet count of 50% or more between two consecutive visits occurred in 17 patients.  Of the 17 (21.8%) DF patients without hemorrhagic tendencies, 4 had isolated thrombocytopenia (classified as 2 D-nonWS and 2 DWWS), 5 had thrombocytopenia and plasma leakage (4 DWWS and 1 SD), 2 had only plasma leakage and were classed as DWWS, and 5 had thrombocytopenia with plasma leakage and signs of shock, meaning they were classified as DWWS with an isolated sign of shock (n = 1) or SD (n = 4). Finally, 1 DF patient did not exhibit any signs of severity, but had abdominal tenderness at defervescence and was classified as DWWS.  Table 4 shows the discrepancies in the clinical manifestations of WHO 1997-classified DF patients (n = 78) compared to the revised WHO 2009 case definitions, including the main clinical signs observed with both classification schemes. Among the 61 (78.2%) DF patients presenting hemorrhagic tendencies, 16 had these alone and were classified as DWWS (n = 15) or D-nonWS (n = 1), while 32 had thrombocytopenia as well, and were classified DWWS under the WHO 2009 criteria. Furthermore, 11 DF had hemorrhagic tendencies and plasma leakage signs and were classified as DWWS (n = 10) or SD (n = 1). One DF patient had plasma leakage and signs of cardiovascular shock, thus corresponding to the SD category, and one had an isolated sign of shock classified as DWWS.  Comparing both classification schemes, only 3.8% (n = 3) of the DF met the D-nonWS criteria, while 87.2% (n = 68) matched with DWWS and 9.0% (n = 7) with SD ( Table 3 ). Among the 78 DHF cases, 64.1% (n = 50) were classified as DWWS and the remaining cases as SD (35.9%, n = 28). All DSS cases were classified as SD (n = 17). Note that no cases with severe bleeding were included in this study.  In order to compare the WHO 1997 and 2009 classification criteria, we performed strict classifications of the of the 173 laboratory-confirmed dengue patients as outlined in the classification schemes in Methods and S1 Appendix . According to the WHO 1997 classification scheme, 78 were classified as DF, 78 as DHF, and 17 as DSS. Using the adapted WHO 2009 case definition, the 173 laboratory-confirmed dengue patients were classified as 3 D-nonWS (1.7%), 118 DWWS (68.2%), and 52 SD (30.1%) (Tables 2 and 3 ).  In addition to the laboratory-confirmed dengue cases, 33 other arbovirus infections (OAI) were diagnosed as follows: acute Chikungunya infection (positive CHIKV RT-qPCR, n = 12; CHIKV-specific IgM seroconversion, n = 1), acute dengue and Chikungunya coinfection (n = 1), recent infection by Chikungunya (n = 1), recent infection by Chikungunya and dengue (n = 1), and recent infection by a flavivirus (n = 17) ( S1 Table ). Differences in clinical and laboratory parameters observed between DI and NDI patients were not always observed between DI and OAI patients ( Table 1 ). This might be expected considering the combination of different recent arboviruses infections and uncertainty in the final diagnosis due to serological cross-reactivity. Consequently, we decided to compare only DI subjects with NDI (including non-dengue/non-arbovirus subjects) in the subsequent analyses.  Among the 173 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases, DENV-1 was the predominant serotype (n = 162, 93.6%) followed by DENV-2 (n = 2, 1.2%). The DENV serotype was not conclusive in 5 NS1 antigen positive patients (2.9%) and 4 additional DENV-specific IgM seroconverted patients (2.3%– Table 2 and S1 Table ). Dengue immune status testing indicated that 127 (73.4%) patients were undergoing a secondary immune response, 29 (16.8%) a primary immune response, and 17 (9.8%) were undetermined ( Table 2 ). The average number of days after onset of symptoms at hospital arrival was significantly higher for DSS (4.6 days) than DHF (3.8 days) (t-test: p = 1.3e-3) and for SD (4.0 days) than DWWS (3.3 days) (t-test: p = 4.6e-3,– Table 2 ). No difference in hospitalization length was observed between the different clinical forms of DI, regardless of the WHO classification used.  Hematological and biochemical findings of included patients at hospital admission are also summarized in Table 1 . Of note, lipid profile results at Visit 1 showed that total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol all had significantly lower means in the DI group than in the NDI group, while triglyceride had a significantly higher mean in the DI group than in the NDI group.  Clinical and physical examinations at hospital admission found that the proportions of patients with hepatomegaly and/or plasma leakage (ascites and pleural effusion) were significantly different across the three conditions (DI, OAI, NDI); hepatomegaly: (43%, 56%, 22%), p = 9.2e-3; ascites: (41%, 50%, 16%), p = 4.5e-3; pleural effusion: (38%, 41%, 11%), p = 2.3e-3. Note also that the presence of at least one plasma leakage sign at admission was associated with significantly different proportions of patients across the three conditions (Fisher exact test, p = 8.1e-3). On the other hand, hemorrhagic manifestations and other warning signs were not different across the three groups at Visit 1. Interestingly, the OAI group, which most likely includes a few subjects for whom the diagnosis of dengue fever could not be formally proven, includes subjects (n = 10, 30.3%) with at least one sign of shock ( Table 1 ).  The mean age in the DI group (7.7 years) was significantly different (younger) than that in the NDI group (9.8 years) (Tukey's test: p = 8.6e-4). Moreover, the average number of days after onset of symptoms for arrival at hospital was significantly higher for DI (3.6 days) than NDI (2.5 days) (Tukey's test: p = 1.6e-4 – Table 1 ).  Between June and October of 2011 and 2012, 243 hospitalized patients with acute dengue-like illness were enrolled in the study, including 109 males and 134 females (male to female ratio: 0.82; mean age ± SD: 8.2 ± 3.3 years; median: 8 years). Among the enrolled patients, 173 (71.2%) were laboratory confirmed acute dengue infections (DI), 33 (13.6%) were diagnosed as other arbovirus infections (OAI), and dengue infection was not found in 37 (15.2%) patients (Non-dengue infection: NDI). Demographic, clinical, and biological characteristics of included patients at hospital admission are in presented in Table 1 .  Discussion  Dengue disease presents as a continuous range rather than distinct clinical entities and much of the time has an unpredictable clinical outcome. In particular, some patients will not develop severe dengue and thus do not require hospitalization. WHO criteria were set up to help clinicians classify patients in order to reduce hospital work loads and provide appropriate patient management. Previous studies comparing the two classification schemes observed that the WHO 1997 one's DF/DHF/DSS division of patients is poorly related to disease severity, is difficult to apply prospectively in current practice, is not very helpful for triage in outbreaks, and leads to different reporting worldwide due to difficulties clinicians find in using it [26]. As for the WHO 2009 classification, defining categories with warning then severity signs (DWWS/SD) has the advantage of being able to define the severity of dengue cases in a timely manner, facilitating dengue case management and surveillance, thus helping to reduce dengue mortality. However, clinical criteria are less strictly defined in it, leaving room for arbitrary interpretation by clinicians [22,23,25].  In this study we compared how well the two classification schemes–WHO 1997 classification versus an adapted WHO 2009 classification for SD case definition with systematic use of ultrasound–correctly classify dengue severity, as well as their usefulness in dengue patient management, in a pediatric cohort of hospitalized severe dengue patients in Cambodia. Recorded values of well-characterized symptoms as used in both classifications: biochemical values, ultrasonography data associated with a reliable diagnosis of dengue infection based on genome and antigen detection or antibody seroconversion detection, were consistently and carefully reported on regular basis throughout the hospitalization period so that the dengue severity classifications were as accurate as possible.  Although the well-characterized pediatric population with clinical and biological parameters confers strength to our data, our study may suffer from limitations. Firstly, only two DENV serotypes were detected (DENV-1 and DENV-2) with DENV-1 largely predominant. Secondly, we defined DI group with including children with laboratory evidence of dengue infection and OAI group of infected patients with inconclusive confirmed arbovirus infection due to serological cross-reactivity between flaviviruses (beside one DENV/CHIV coinfection). We decided to not consider patient from OAI from our analysis to reduce the risk of bias, as including the DENV/CHIKV co-infection and others probable recent flavivirus infections might have an impact on results.  Similar to what has been previously demonstrated in other countries, in this cohort of Cambodian children we observed that the WHO 1997 classification acts longitudinally, using strict prerequisite clinical and/or biological signs to move from one step to the next [16,24,26]. Thus, a patient with all DSS clinical signs cannot be classified as DSS if they do not first meet all clinical and/or laboratory criteria for DF and DHF. This can lead to underestimating the number of severe dengue cases and inadequate clinical management. In our study, 87.2% and 9% of DF cases were actually classified respectively as DWWS and SD, and 35.9% of DHF were considered as SD using the adapted WHO 2009 classification. Interestingly, all 7 patients classified as DF according to the WHO 1997 case definition and classified as SD according to adapted WHO 2009, showed at least some sign of plasma leakage, highlighting the discrepancy observed between these two classifications. Additionally, SD more precisely defines the group of patients requiring intensive clinical follow-up, since SD includes all of the DSS plus 36% of the DHF, and even 9% of the DF, in our study. However, we adapted the WHO 2009 dengue classification for defining SD by using ultrasound to anticipate an aggravation of the patient with occurrence of respiratory distress. This strategy might explain the high proportion of SD case reported during this study. While using the strict 2009 criteria cases with moderate or large pleural effusion but without clinical respiratory distress would be classified as DWWS, so the discrepancies observed between the two systems would be less marked. Though the 1997 classification seems poorly-adapted to early and appropriate patient clinical management, its separation into different dengue clinical syndromes probably makes it more suitable for the study of dengue pathogenesis.  The WHO 2009 case definition, being transversal with a broad definition of the different forms of dengue fever in the DWWS category, is more flexible in terms of clinical management of hospitalized dengue-confirmed cases [40]. Clinicians may independently consider clinical and biological criteria related to hemorrhagic tendencies and plasma leakage as warning signs, and thus adapt appropriate patient management at given times during hospitalization. Moreover, besides dengue shock syndrome, the WHO 2009 classification proposes definitions for non-DHF types of severe dengue fever with severe organ involvement [11], leading to an emphasis on triage and clinical management, rather than on a pathophysiologically defined syndrome [26].  Our results demonstrate that the systematic use of ultrasonographic examination at the time of patient admission is important to evaluate plasma leakage as early as possible. Ultrasonograms are more sensitive, more accurate, and more practical for detecting plasma leakage than the 20% increase in hematocrit and/or lateral decubitus chest X-ray recommended by WHO 1997, and provide objective evidence. Moreover, serial ultrasonographic examinations can be conveniently repeated regularly during hospitalization. This has previously shown its effectiveness [41] in contrast to studies where ultrasound examinations were performed only once [42,43]. Moreover, most severe dengue cases are hospitalized close to the critical phase, i.e., 4 to 5 days after onset of symptoms, and hence need accurate and immediate clinical management. Importantly, our findings highlight that the presence of at least one plasma leakage sign at admission (ascites or pleural effusion, both detected by ultrasound, or facial oedema observed during clinical examination) could significantly help differentiate dengue case from other OAI and NDI. This suggests that detection of plasma leakage at admission using ultrasound, in association with other clinical and biological parameters, should be further explored as a potential diagnostic tool and prognosis marker of dengue severity.  Laboratory changes were well-characterized in our study in dengue patients at different stages of the disease. These included classical hematological and biochemical parameters (liver function and inflammation), dengue viral load and NS1 antigen concentration. As previously reported, transaminase levels were significantly higher and platelet count lower in SD patients compared to DWWS patients. Levels of secreted NS1 pooled over all days after onset of symptoms were lower in the more severe cases in both classification schemes (SD vs DWWS and DHF/DSS vs DF, respectively). Interestingly, lipid profile changes evaluated in our study were of great relevance, with differences between DWWS and SD seen in particular at hospital admission. Changes in lipid levels were observed mainly in SD patients, characterized by a decrease in total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol at admission. Although there is a trend towards a return to normal total cholesterol at hospital discharge, HDL and to a lesser extent LDL cholesterol levels remain below the normal range for both DWWS and SD.  Total cholesterol consists mostly of LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol and, to a lesser extent, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglycerides. A relationship between circulating lipids and dengue infection has been previously observed in studies, with lower levels of total cholesterol seen in severe dengue cases than in less severe ones or in healthy people [44,45]. Moreover, two previous studies described a decrease in total and LDL cholesterol levels during dengue disease, with the size of the decrease being correlated with the severity of the disease [38,46]. These results are in partial agreement with our observations, as the decrease in HDL cholesterol observed in our study seems to be as much or even more significant as that of LDL.  However, the relationships between severe dengue and total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol, respectively, remain unclear. It has been reported that during dengue infection, the modulation of levels of host cholesterol facilitates viral entry, formation of replicative complexes, viral assembly, and control of the interferon type I response [39]. Moreover, the dengue sNS1 protein is a nonstructural protein that is secreted in blood during patient viremia and forms an atypical high density lipoprotein particle, suggesting that dengue NS1 might mimic or hijack lipid metabolic pathways and contribute to endothelium dysfunction [47]. These observations together suggest that interactions between NS1 protein and lipid metabolism might be involved in dengue pathogenesis.  In conclusion, our results bolster previous reports regarding discrepancies in the classification of severe dengue case between the WHO 1997 and 2009 guidelines due to the stepwise organization of clinical and/or biological signs used in the 1997 classification. Using an adapted WHO 2009 classification, SD more precisely defined the group of patients requiring clinical follow-up during hospitalization Thus, the most appropriate therapy can be quickly initiated. Finally, the challenge remains to predict the outcome of dengue-infected. The systematic use of ultrasonographic examination at admission is crucial in order to evaluate plasma leakage. In addition, lipid markers are potential predictive markers of dengue severity at hospital."

What does the Buddha give people? Whatever they need.  If people need peace of mind, he gives them meditation. If they need liberation, he gives them the path to enlightenment. And if what they need is food and shelter, he gives them, well, food and shelter.  At many Buddhist centers in the West, the main focus is on offering people meditation instruction and Buddhist teachings. The idea is that if we’re looking for an end to suffering, this is the ultimate answer. Running a soup kitchen or some other form of charity work would just offer people temporary relief.  The problem is that this only gives certain people what they need—the privileged ones who don’t have to worry about feeding their family and have the luxury to focus on their own spiritual development. People suffering real hardship have more pressing priorities than meditating, and the Buddha cares about them too. If what they need now is food and shelter, he gives it to them.  That’s the view of three Buddhist organizations that see humanitarian work as an essential expression of their Buddhist values and put it at the center of their mission.  Taiwanese Buddhist nun Cheng Yen woke up to the devastating impact of poverty in 1966 when, in a small hospital in Taiwan, she saw a woman who suffered a miscarriage being forced to return to her mountain village because she couldn’t pay for medical treatment. The woman later died from complications.  SIGN UP FOR LION’S ROAR NEWSLETTERS Get even more Buddhist wisdom delivered straight to your inbox! Sign up for Lion’s Roar free email newsletters. Leave this field empty if you're human:  After witnessing this, Cheng Yen established the Tzu Chi Foundation. Now, it’s the world’s largest Buddhist charity, with more than ten million members in forty-seven countries, and it’s well-known for its focus on disaster relief and humanitarian aid.  Cheng Yen started Tzu Chi as a grassroots project with thirty of her female followers. Each woman agreed to save fifty cents from her grocery money every day, keeping the funds in homemade bamboo savings banks. In the first year, Cheng Yen and her community raised enough to help fifteen families in east Taiwan. From there, Tzu Chi grew as more people decided they too could put away a small amount daily to help someone in need. By 1970, the organization began offering medical aid, eventually opening hospitals in cities and townships throughout Taiwan.  The words “tzu” and “chi” are Chinese for “compassion” and “relief.” Han Huang, CEO of Tzu Chi Foundation, says that when volunteers help others they experience and understand the true definition of compassion. “They care about people they don’t even know,” he says. “There are many different ways to practice Buddhism, but dharma master Cheng Yen believes that you have to talk the talk and walk the walk. The way she does this and how she has taught us to do this is through providing compassion and relief.”  In 1989, when a young American businessman, Stephen Huang, paid a visit to Cheng Yen to seek personal guidance, he was impressed by what she and her community had so far accomplished with Tzu Chi. Huang decided to bring the spirit of this organization to the West, and with him spearheading the effort, Tzu Chi’s first international chapter was established in California as Tzu Chi USA. It has since expanded throughout the United States.  Tzu Chi USA focuses on several areas of humanitarian aid: education, medicine, culture, disaster relief, and environmental protection. In 2012, Tzu Chi USA received the Champions of Change award from the White House after distributing ten million dollars in immediate relief to the victims of Hurricane Sandy. More recently, volunteers provided relief to victims of Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and the wildfires in California. In 2017, Tzu Chi USA gave out thousands of eco-friendly blankets, tons of rice, and hot meals, serving almost seventeen thousand families.  Tzu Chi USA also organizes clinics to provide low-income and vulnerable communities with medical, dental, and health services. Han Huang is especially proud of Tzu Chi’s See to Succeed Program, whereby two buses outfitted as mobile vision stations visit communities throughout the U.S. where a significant percentage of residents do not have coverage for vision care.  “I think that our mobile stations encapsulate what we do,” Huang says. “We know that people who need help often cannot reach us, so we reach out to them.”  Cheng Yen’s hope for the foundation has always been not only to “help the poor,” but also to “educate the rich.” It’s a mission that inspires love and humanity in both the receiver and the giver. “The volunteer spirit is the Tzu Chi spirit,” Huang says.  Buddhist Global Relief was founded by the American monk, scholar, and activist Bhikkhu Bodhi. “Buddhist Global Relief is driven by a conviction in the power of goodness,” he says. “It’s goodness that gives meaning and value to our lives, as well as a conviction to create bonds of human solidarity.”  The inspiration for Buddhist Global Relief was actually an article that Bhikkhu Bodhi wrote for Buddhadharma, the quarterly journal published by Lion’s Roar.  “For years,” he remembers, “I’d wanted to do something to express compassion in action. To translate the high ideals of Buddhism into some type of activity that would be directly beneficial to other human beings.”  So in 2007 he published an article in Buddhadharma that challenged Buddhists to advocate for justice. “We Western Buddhists,” he wrote, “tend to dwell in a cognitive space that defines the first noble truth largely against the background of our middle-class lifestyles: as the gnawing of discontent; the ennui of over-satiation; the pain of unfulfilling relationships; or, with a bow to Buddhist theory, as bondage to the round of rebirths. Too often, I feel, our focus on these aspects of dukkha has made us oblivious to the vast, catastrophic suffering that daily overwhelms three-fourths of the world’s population.”  “When I published the article, I had no intention of forming any kind of organization,” says Bhikkhu Bodhi. But members of his community were inspired to take action and establish a relief organization to address the challenges he’d outlined. This marked the start of Buddhist Global Relief (BGR).  After raising some money, the nonprofit organization initiated three starter projects: delivering meals to poor hospital patients in Vietnam, offering livelihood training to women in Sri Lanka, and partnering with Save the Children to provide disaster relief to communities affected by a cyclone in Myanmar.  News about BGR began to spread and pledges rolled in. Today, BGR supports thirty-five initiatives around the world that address four areas of need: direct food aid, the education of girls and women, right livelihood opportunities for women, and ecologically sustainable agriculture.  When a catastrophic earthquake hit Haiti in 2010, many children lost their parents, which meant they also lost access to food. BGR partnered with an organization to provide free meals to children. “Children walk miles every day to get in line to get food,” Bodhi says. “For many of them, it’s their only meal of the day.” BGR also helped build and fund a school there.  When girls in Cambodia reach age thirteen or fourteen, their families pressure them to drop out of school to work. To prevent this, BGR has partnered with Lotus Outreach on a long-running project called GATE (Girls Access to Education). Their method is to provide families with rice if they agree not to urge their daughters to leave school.  Approximately 90 percent of the girls in the program have completed the equivalent of high school, and more than one hundred girls have gone on to pursue postsecondary education. BGR funds the education of girls and women through programs in Nagpur, India, and in Himalayan communities in northern India and Bangladesh. In Cambodia, BGR has supported around twenty-five girls in their postsecondary studies by covering their transportation, tuition, and living costs.  By partnering with the Bodhicitta Foundation, founded by Australian Buddhist nun Ayya Yeshe, BGR provides livelihood training to women. This program trains women to become tailors or beauticians or to enter the field of information technology. BGR’s similar program in Cameroon provides practical vocational training for single mothers and marginalized women. There, more than 340 women have been trained in hairdressing, cosmetology, or sewing.  Finally, in the area of supporting sustainable agriculture, BGR partners with organizations like Oxfam to sponsor sustainable rice cultivation techniques that result in larger harvest yields and lower chemical outputs.  “It’s not enough just to be content with developing love and compassion as inward qualities,” concludes Bhikkhu Bodhi. “We also have to be able to transform these inner states into practical actions that bring real relief to the suffering of other living beings.”  Sacrifice one cappuccino,” Tibetan teacher Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche advises people. “Spend that money on changing a girl’s whole life. This is not a metaphor. This is a reality.”  Seeing how such small sums of money could save children’s lives, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche started Lotus Outreach International in 1993. Initially, it began as a scholarship program for students enrolled in primary and secondary education at his monastery in Himachal Pradesh, India. From there, he slowly expanded the depth, reach, and number of programs.  Lotus Outreach is now a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering women and children in poverty by providing them with education, training, and health care. A website video describes its mission this way: “An eight-year-old girl sold by her own mother to European pedophiles. A young untouchable boy working in a stone quarry in southern India. A woman forced to work as a prostitute in Cambodia’s red light districts in order to feed her small children. These are the people served by Lotus Outreach International.”  With affiliates in six countries and NGO partners in India and Cambodia, Lotus Outreach runs programs that foster sustainable change in communities by serving the urgent needs of the most vulnerable. Educating low-income and poverty-stricken children, especially girls, allows them to hone skills that could positively impact their entire family and village.  “In Buddhism, we recognize that everyone is worthy as a human being,” says Patty Waltcher, president of Lotus Outreach. “While compassion is one of the main tenets of Buddhism, we really feel that our work goes beyond Buddhism—it’s a basic human response to suffering.”  Today, the organization is a global nonprofit that works mostly in India and Cambodia, and is largely made up of volunteers. “One thing that nonprofits try to achieve is spending more on their programs and less on other things,” says Glenn Fawcett, the executive director. “We run very lean so that we can invest in more women and girls, which is proven to have a high social and economic impact.”  All of Lotus Outreach’s programs work in concert to be of maximum benefit. For example, GATE is complemented by their Blossom Bus and Lotus Petal programs. GATE, which receives support from Buddhist Global Relief, covers tuition costs and provides families with food so that girls can focus on their studies. Blossom Bus provides daily transportation to school for almost seven hundred girls, and Lotus Pedals provides 3,100 students with heavy terrain bicycles.  Lotus Outreach is also running a program to keep children safe while their parents are away at work from morning until evening. This after-school program both keeps children enrolled in school and provides evening classes to ensure they are caught up in their studies.  Lotus Outreach focuses primarily on the empowerment of girls and women because they are often the most vulnerable in low-income countries to becoming victims of discrimination and exploitation. To combat this, Fawcett says they empower girls and women through a combination of education, training, and care.  One young woman, Phach Meas, grew up in an exceptionally poor family. Her heart was set on going to school, even though her family couldn’t afford books or stationery. To help her with her studies, Meas’ father fashioned muddy chalk from river clay and a crude chalkboard from a piece of lumber. Lotus Outreach helped Meas attend high school, followed by a baking program. Today, she is a trained pastry chef and earns a sustainable living wage.  So far, Lotus Outreach has provided almost 1,500 girls with high school scholarships, 350 university and college scholarships, and more than four hundred thousand kilograms of rice to feed their families."

The global lockdowns spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic have given many people the rare opportunity to finish their personal projects. For a game developer with zero programming experience in the Philippines, it was a videogame about the Vietnam War which took almost 20 years to complete. “I was always interested in history and the Vietnam War in particular,” says game developer Tiger Yan. “I started creating The ‘Nam: Vietnam Combat Operations way back in 2003 but work and life were more important, so the project was mothballed for 17 years. Like everyone else, the COVID-19 outbreak forced me to stay home most of 2020. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to learn basic programming and finally finish what I started.” Yan, who photographs wild and rural areas of Asia, created the game as a nonprofit learning tool for people to experience commanding soldiers during the Vietnam War. He used his field experience investigating rural communities to make the game as realistic as possible. “From irrigation dikes and rice paddies to barking dogs and crowing chickens, this game brings the Vietnamese countryside to life.” According to the game’s Facebook page, players can command US Marines, Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army troops, plus the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). The Vietnam War ended in 1975 when the North Vietnamese and Vietcong unified Vietnam under communist rule. The game is now being featured in various fora and though it can be downloaded online for free, Yan urges gamers to make a donation to APOPO, a nonprofit organization working to clear dangerous landmines in Cambodia. “The real Vietnam War wrought great misery for the people of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. If this game can spur at least one good donation, then it would have been worth it,” says Yan. Though COVID-19 has paralyzed the world, people can look at the silver lining. The lockdowns have finally given many people a resource which for years has been in short supply – time.

The new coronavirus has messed up all of our plans, and the big question facing the government now is this: With very limited resources, what are the solutions that can create the most immediate and positive impacts on Vietnam's economic growth from now to the end of the year and next year? We can call this the post-present Covid-19 crisis period.  Following is a brief outline of the views I have shared with some experts and managers.  To ensure economic growth in the short and medium term, the priorities that deserve urgent attention are: supporting and promoting new economic growth drivers; making exports more competitive; and boosting domestic demand.  First, we need to promote strong development of the non-contact industries. This can be done after successfully completing our telecommunications infrastructure to support the digital economy.  So far, just more than half of Vietnam’s 95-million population use the internet and most of them live in urban areas, getting connected via their smartphones. The nation’s internet quality, meanwhile, is going down.  For developing the digital economy, we need to focus resources on improving the telecommunications infrastructure so that Vietnam can extend the reach of 4G service to all rural and mountainous areas, and do the same with 5G for urban areas. Investments should be made for the country to equip itself with better broadband Internet connections and have more submarine cables to ensure their smooth connection.  Vietnam currently has six submarine cable systems and a 120 gigabit channel that runs overland through China.  Connected in November 2009, the $560-million Asia America Gateway (AAG) handles more than 60 percent of the country’s international Internet traffic. The cable runs more than 20,000 kilometers (12,420 miles), connecting Southeast Asia with the U.S., passing through Brunei, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. But it has experienced frequent ruptures and repairs, repeatedly affecting services in Vietnam.  If the government offers subsidies to allow free internet services in rural and mountainous areas, it would create an important breakthrough, boosting the number of people having access to the digital economy. Internet is not yet popular in several areas and offering it free will be a very good policy that not just favors the people but also boosts socio-economic development without costing the government much money. Having as many people get access to the internet as possible would create a foundation for Vietnam to achieve contactless public services, including the completion of administrative procedures, online studies and healthcare delivery.  The second task would be to boost infrastructure development for the logistics sector so that Vietnam can reduce costs for businesses. Vietnam is among the nations with the most open economy in the world. The total amount of good it exports and imports each year is estimated at more than $500 billion, double its gross domestic product (GDP). The nation’s logistics costs, meanwhile, amount to 21 percent of its GDP, among the highest in the world. It is only when Vietnam can lower its costs that it can make its products more competitive and boost exports.  What I want to emphasize here is the need to remove obstacles at major entry points, allowing exporters and importers to complete customs clearance processes more quickly, reduce costs, and contribute to improving the competitiveness of Vietnamese goods.  The question now is how to improve infrastructure at points where 90 percent of the goods go out or come in, like the Noi Bai and Tan Son Nhat international airports in Hanoi and HCMC, the port systems in HCMC and its neighboring province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau, the northern Hai Phong City and Quang Ninh Province as well as in central Da Nang City, the border gates in provinces that share borders with China, Laos and Cambodia, like Lang Son, Quang Ninh, Lao Cai, Quang Tri and Tay Ninh.  For example, the Noi Bai International Airport, which currently accounts for 75 percent of the value of goods shipped out by air, is in urgent need of an additional runway beside the two existing ones, an upgrade to the cargo terminal and extra transit warehouses. Tech giants like Samsung and Apple will not want to expand their operations in Vietnam if they see runways at major airports get jammed frequently.  Our border gates need extra manpower and further streamlining of administrative procedures towards allowing faster customs clearance of goods.  Road freight now accounts for 75 percent of Vietnam’s total good transportation. The cost of gasoline and tolls make up a significant part of the production cost of transport companies. If the government boldly removes all taxes and fees related to petroleum, which currently account for 64 percent of the current gasoline prices, it will create a breakthrough.  Containers of Dinh Vu Port in Hai Phong, northern Vietnam, are seen from above. Photo by Reuters/Kham.  Next, it would be much better if the government provides transportation companies with subsidies to cover road fees, especially the toll for build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, which has been causing public frustration.  Tax breaks and fee reductions have always had an immediate impact on businesses. Before Covid-19, businesses may not have needed them, but now, such interventions will help reduce logistics costs immediately and help them recover.  Renewable energy is a global trend, and Vietnam has a great potential to produce solar and wind power. However, private firms struggle when they have produced solar power but cannot connect it to the national grid. Besides, the policy on electricity prices has always been unstable and changed frequently and related state documents are often slow in coming, giving no time for businesses to prepare themselves. These factors have hindered the development of the renewable energy sector in Vietnam.  If the infrastructure in areas that have been planned for renewable energy development is upgraded and if Vietnam has a stable and long-term electricity price policy that is only changed every five years, we can promote private investment in the sector, and thus reduce environmental pollution that is getting worse at thermal power plants.  And last but not the least, the government must focus on maintaining the resilience of the two important economic hubs in the country, Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, to avoid a complete collapse.  Of course, these are not easy steps and the proposed changes will lead to a sharp decrease in budget revenues and a huge increase in overspending. But in times of grave crises, sacrifices have to be made to extricate the nation out and take it forward.  I hope such reforms receive the consent and support of the National Assembly."

Photo: Jeff Pachoud/AFP via Getty Images  Every year, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation releases a Goalkeepers report, tracking the world’s progress toward the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals. The news is almost always pretty good. This year’s edition is … not like that. “Almost every time we have opened our mouths or put pen to paper,” the Gateses write in the report’s introduction, “we have celebrated decades of historic progress in fighting poverty and disease. But we have to confront the current reality with candor: This progress has now stopped.” Their annual report tracks global progress on 18 different metrics. “In recent years, the world has improved on every single one. This year, on the vast majority, we’ve regressed.”  For a nonmedical civilian, Bill Gates has occupied an unusually central role in the story of the coronavirus pandemic almost since it arose. Gates, who spent much of the past decade warning the world about the risks of a respiratory pandemic, found himself funding a flu study this spring that was among the first documenting community spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. He has devoted much of the foundation’s resources to infectious disease and global immunization programs over the years and now has funded a lot of expedited research into possible coronavirus vaccines and treatments — indeed, he helped pre-fund the manufacturing of seven candidate vaccines, long before knowing whether they would work. (He also became the center of an unfortunately pervasive coronavirus conspiracy theory.) While Gates has been worrying about, and working toward, our ability to respond to the coronavirus in the short term, judging from the Goalkeepers report, he may be even more worried about what the pandemic means for the long-term trajectory of global development.  In early September, I spoke with him about how much damage has been done to that trajectory; how the world, and the U.S. in particular, failed so spectacularly in containing SARS-CoV-2 barely a decade after very successfully containing SARS-CoV-1 (and even more recently containing MERS and H1N1); how bleak the fall looks to him in terms of the pandemic; and when, and in what form, we can expect real global relief from vaccines to arrive. (Unfortunately, not that soon, he says.)  I thought we should start with the Goalkeepers report itself. To me, this report is always a perspective giver — it makes me remember that, however grim things look, many things are getting much better in so many areas of the world. This year’s report offers a very different message — you talk about losing 25 years’ worth of progress on vaccination and the long-term effects of missed schooling. In the West, a lot of us tend to think this pandemic is going to pass — we’ll get through it and, on the other side, things will resemble the way they were before. How do you see the global impact? How big, how bad, and how lasting are these setbacks?  It’s a super-good question. As you say, the gradual progress in literacy and reducing malnutrition, reducing childhood death, extending life spans — that largely goes unnoticed, and it’s the most amazing story there is. This year, it’s just bad news.  But how bad?  In the very best case, two years from now, you would be, for some of the health things in particular, ideally back at where you were at the beginning of 2020.  Two years.  That is, if we’re lucky enough that several of these vaccines work, including the ones that are low cost enough that we can scale the manufacturing. And if we get the factories going and we get the money to buy it for the entire world.  That’s the very best case.  In that case, during 2021, the pandemic is going down, and in 2022, the global pandemic comes to an end. Could we sit here two years from now and say, “Okay, during that time, not only did we end the pandemic; did we also restore the vaccination services and catch up to the kids that got missed? Could we restore the malaria work and HIV work that was lost to the pandemic?”  On the economic statistics, these countries don’t have the ability to raise their government debt like the rich countries do. And so what we’ve done with the CARES Act, the first $3 trillion, there is no equivalent that can take place in Nigeria or most of the developing countries. India’s done a bit because they’re a low-middle income country, but once you get below the India level, there hasn’t been a lot of aid generosity. Poor countries have had to deal with this largely on their own. The only good news in developing countries is the death rates have been actually fairly low.  Across sub-Saharan Africa, the fatality rate appears to be much lower than in Europe, the U.S., or Asia.  Ninety percent percent of that is due to the age structure of their population. Their societies are about 20 to 25 years younger on average. These are very young countries. And even though the newspapers highlight the cases of younger people who do get the disease, some of whom die, those are very small numbers.  I saw one analysis suggesting the disease was 10,000 times more deadly for a 90-year-old than a 9-year-old.  Early in the epidemic, where some of the medical personnel were getting huge doses, you did have people in their 20s and 30s who had died. That largely has stopped. Yes, there are some cases, but it’s like flu, where, in a typical year, you have 60,000 deaths in the U.S. from flu. Four hundred of those are people under the age of 60. So it’s really very age-specific. This thing, even more now, is very age-specific.  India isn’t as young, and the density of their slums is such that they’ve actually had a pretty tough epidemic. South America is coming out the worst — they’re old enough to have a lot of deaths, and yet they’re poor enough that their slums have just super-high density. And of course their health system, although they’re better than Africa, they still have been overloaded.  So the education and economic damage from this pandemic may not get solved for more than a decade. And yet actually mapping those into something people can recognize. GDP — of course GDP is this super-abstract thing. Deaths — people understand deaths. But if you said, “Okay, every kid in the U.S. misses two years of education,” how would you map that to something where people would know to cry? It’s not easy.  So — how did this happen? In the U.S., we’ve been so focused on the failures in the White House and the inability to put together a national strategy. And obviously that has been a failure. But we’ve also had failures at the FDA, particularly in its supervision of testing, and the CDC, particularly in its muddled guidance on things like mask-wearing. And while the U.S. has done especially poorly, particularly when judged against expectations, it’s also the case that when you look globally, almost nowhere outside of East Asia have things been handled very well. As recently as the first SARS, the global public-health apparatus was able to contain it — a similar respiratory infection, though of course there are important differences. But the response to this one has also been different. So what went wrong, in your view?  Well, first, SARS is just not as infectious as coronavirus. And you have asymptomatics who can infect people. That’s really bad because they don’t self-identify — they’re asymptomatic.  They don’t know they have the disease and don’t know to avoid contact with others.  Polio has this problem. It’s a huge difference between smallpox and polio. Smallpox, we handed people a card, and said, “Find somebody with a rash that looks like that and we’ll give you a payment.” And even illiterate people would bring in people with rashes and say, “Give me my payment.” You could find people, and it wouldn’t have spread. Whereas with the asymptomatics, by the time you find the kid who’s paralytic, the disease can be a thousand miles away. So asymptomatics are really bad and being infectious before you become symptomatic is bad too — that’s called presymptomatics; those are really bad. You can say that’s all one phenomenon.  Two, we thought this was a coughing disease. All respiratory diseases are coughing diseases. They make you cough. Flu, in order to get out and survive, it causes you to cough. And this disease isn’t about coughing. About 20 percent of people do develop a cough, but this thing can spread in many other ways.  Heavy breathing, singing, speaking …  Actually the louder you talk, the more this upper-respiratory-tract super-spreader phenomenon takes place. It’s taken us a long time to figure that out. And that’s part of the reasons why masks are a big deal, because people who aren’t coughing are still spreading this thing. And it wasn’t until sometime in April that people started to say, “Wow, these masks are kind of cheap. How the hell did this thing spread in that restaurant in China? How the hell are we seeing these massive spreading events?” You have a wedding party, and you infect 50 people. You have a biogen conference, you infect 50 people.  It’s hard to imagine a single person coughing directly on 50 different people.  We were naïve medically about it. If it had been a flu, we would have been less stupid, though we’re way more stupid about flu than we should be. That’s why I was doing the Seattle flu study that happened to—  Happened to catch it — the first detection of community spread in the U.S.  These 40,000 travelers coming back: If you’re not going to test them or quarantine them, then why did you do your travel ban? Your travel ban is laughable because 40,000 people came from China. And, by the way, these Europeans are still coming in and it’s gotten there. And that’s what happened out on the East Coast, by and large. So the U.S. response — you would have expected the U.S. to have the best response. We have the most PCR machines per capita by so much it’s unbelievable. I mean, it’s crazy. And yet we end up being as bad as health systems that have spent half as much, countries that don’t have a CDC.  So there’s a variety of things that went into our relative underperformance. Some countries like Norway, Denmark, they did a lot of things right, but they also probably had fewer cases coming into their country. It’s very hard to measure that. Vietnam, it’s easy to celebrate — relative to its GDP, it has the best education system and the best health system. This is ignoring this pandemic. It’s very weird that some of these communist countries in terms of global good, the public good, they do very, very well. Cuba, even Kerala, which is the most socialistic part of India, has by far the best health system.  South Korea is an amazing story of contact tracing. They thought, “Hey, who has PCR machines?” And they got testing to be free and quick, and they never had long turnarounds on tests. That’s a unique U.S. stupidity, that we let the commercial guys get so rich on these tests that they take backlogs. There was no benefit to paying anybody for a test that takes more than 24 hours.  And when you see some results only coming back a week later, the person’s whole infectious period may have passed.  It’s just pure throw-the-money-away type insanity. It’s incenting the worst behavior. So in the U.S., we’ll be studying the mistakes the CDC actually made, and then the muzzling of the CDC, for years to come.  You walked through Vietnam and South Korea. Those are two very different countries with very different income levels. And, really, if you look at all of East Asia, you see a real diversity of public-health capacities and different levels of wealth. And compared to how the West, defined broadly, has done, just about every country in East Asia did remarkably well. They contained the disease much better than even the best nations of Europe did. What could we have done to make our response work as well as theirs? Why didn’t the global public-health apparatus make sure that what was working in Asia was advised in the West?  Well, there is no global health apparatus.  Okay, fair enough.  Well, no, let’s be serious. The WHO has a budget of about $3 billion a year that’s split across so many things. You can take their total head count and say, “How many of their people were assigned to these things?” Margaret Chan was a very good WHO director before Tedros, and Tedros is a very good director. But it is a U.N. organization. It has a U.N. personnel system. Margaret did her best to work within that framework. So, yeah, it’s not perfect, but it hasn’t been chartered to do a lot of fancy things. They don’t make vaccines, they don’t have planes, they don’t have factories. The whole idea of studying masks, that’s an academic thing that they can gather up the academic stuff and just put their stamp on it because they’re the normative agency. But to expect them to have done something magical …  I haven’t looked at Cambodia. I haven’t looked at Myanmar. Certainly South Asia is really bad. The India epidemic is a horrific epidemic. They just became No. 2. They passed Brazil in terms of number of cases, and they test less per capita. So it’s —  Even worse than it looks.  About Asia broadly, there is this theory that cross-protection in that part of the world is higher because there’s more bats in that part of the world and so more coronaviruses have escaped and people there will have more cross-protection.  That is, some amount of protection, if not immunity, from exposure to other coronaviruses.  Who knows if that’s true. And that’s another one that, as we measure T-cell responses and B-cell responses — very smart people disagree on this prior cross-protection issue. There’s something there, but is that a huge deal in terms of when the epidemic starts to drop off or not? Still no agreement. There’s many things that look promising.  What other things, what other factors, are you thinking of?  It looked like people who took various vaccines like BCG or polio vaccine, that that explained why it didn’t spread as much, but that data’s all fallen apart. It doesn’t look like any vaccine that stimulates your immune system in some horizontal way is beneficial. For a while, that looked promising, but that has not held up. Otherwise, like the polio vaccine — India wouldn’t be experiencing this. Or they have BCG, which the West has largely dropped.  But we will be ready for the next pandemic if it’s like this one. If it’s not some bioterrorist evil smallpox thing that spreads super, super fast. If it’s this type of spread, we can do PCR testing. The most amazing PCR testing in the world is what we do against GMO seeds, because you want to test literally millions of these things. The foundation is now funding taking that and applying that to respiratory disease, to create what we’d have to call megatesting, which is where our country will be able to test over 20 percent of the population per week. Now nobody’s ever done that. People have talked about that as a way out of this thing. It’s very much a brute-force way. There’s nothing elegant about that at all, but to have a standby capacity that can do that, actually the costs to do so wouldn’t be prohibitive, because the machines are so efficient. We’re still proving out the approach, but it’s very likely to work.  You’d probably have to have the consent of the population to do something like that — effectively surveillance-level testing. It would solve some of the asymptomatic and presymptomatic issues that you were talking about. But it raises other issues. Personally, I think American resistance to top-down interventions tends to get somewhat overstated — after all, we did all shelter in place for a few months, completely suspending our normal lives, even if later some fraction of us refused to wear masks — but might there not be some hesitation to accept a testing regime like that? Because the testing regime you’re describing, as a way of dealing with future pandemics, would seem to require preemptive testing, effectively surveillance testing?  I’m not sure you’d see that much resistance to the idea of taking a swab and putting it up the tip of your nose and putting it into a plastic bag. It’s different than a vaccine, where that’s a needle going into your arm. If you’re potentially going to kill your grandmother, I hope you’re willing to give us a little snot just on behalf of your grandma. So, no, I think that would be okay. Already, if you’re an NBA player, I think you have to give snot on a regular basis.  And with some of these $1 tests, it wouldn’t even necessarily be that expensive.  Yeah. Well, the strip test can be made very inexpensively, but because they’re in short supply, they’re being sold more like $5 to $10. Those tests don’t have the same accuracy, though. So when you want to get to super-low cost, do you do it by super-scaling up the molecular central-lab approach? Or do you go with a lateral-flow nitrocellulose strip test, like a pregnancy test? Both paths we’re funding. We have work at Flextronics on taking the strip test down to more like a 30-to-40-cent marginal cost of production.  You were talking about being ready for the next pandemic. I’m curious how you think about the next phase of this one. The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which you’re involved with, put out this much-talked-about projection a few days ago suggesting that 400,000 Americans could die by the end of the year. And a lot of that is built on the expected seasonality effect, whereby the disease gets worse in the fall after having gotten a little bit lighter in the spring and summer. But the infection fatality rate has also been steadily falling and is, especially for younger people, much, much lower than it was early in the epidemic. So I’m curious how you see both of these forces coming together between now and the arrival of a vaccine or vaccines? Is it the case that the infection fatality rate is falling quickly enough that this disease is becoming less concerning than it was in the spring? Or are we really dealing with the same disease and we’ll be faced with a quite grim fall because of the seasonality effect? Or somewhere in between?Well, IHME — if you take all the modelers’ views of the fall, IHME would be on the pessimistic side. There are some people who are more optimistic than they are. I don’t think anybody knows exactly what’s right. This is very complex stuff. As you say, the IHME and many modelers see a strong seasonal effect. And that’s what drives their projection of the daily death rate. In November, it’s at a thousand a day, and it gets up over 2,000.  That’s 2,000 per day — so considerably worse than we have now, and nearly as bad as the very worst of the epidemic in the spring.  They show quite a bleak fall. I hope that’s wrong, but that is serious science that has been done there, even though the confidence intervals are absolutely gigantic. So the good news is maybe they’re wrong. The other good news is maybe medical interventions come along.  How do you assess that progress?  It’s really mind blowing that the only truly proven drug intervention is dexamethazone — the U.K. study we funded is what came up with that. We don’t have good news on plasma. The Remdesivir looks like a pretty minor effect. The other antivirals, they’re moving along. The one that is a wild card here is monoclonal antibodies. That could be a very dramatic effect. And there’s Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, Regeneron; all within the next two months will have data for us about monoclonal antibodies.  The foundation, we’ve reserved a lot of the factory capacity for monoclonal antibodies to be able to make them for underdeveloping countries in case it works. And for it to work for us, it has to be a pretty modest dose that you don’t need multi-day IV infusion. We need to be able to do a single shot in early disease.  Of course, time is always on your side, in that if you get a really bad epidemic, then you get a lot of natural immunity with unknown duration.  How worried are you about short-lived immunity?  Almost certainly it’s in the multi-year timeframe for most people.  The medical interventions are what I’m mostly focused on and making sure that those are available to the entire world. We’re partners with AstraZeneca, Novavax, Sanofi, and Johnson & Johnson to get them to allow the manufacture of their vaccines in the world’s highest-volume vaccine factories, which are in India, controlled by Serum, Bio E, and Bharat. And that’s never been done before where you invent a vaccine by company A but most of the volume gets actually produced by company B. But in this case, it’s the only way, since the demand will be very, very high. And as our report says, if you misallocate, if you just allocate based on wealth, using the forecast that things are going to stay pretty bad, you get twice as many deaths as if you go out to health workers first.  To me, the vaccine development is one of the silver linings of all of this: we’ve invented almost on the fly a method by which we can actually get these things going quite quickly. As a result, we’ve come up with some new model approaches to building a vaccine. So that’ll presumably benefit us down the line with future diseases. But for the time being, I’m curious whether you are worried about the rollout of these vaccines both in the U.S. and abroad? How it will be administered and to whom is very much an open question.  Well, we won’t use a pure merit-based allocation. The U.S. has funded the R&D and trials of these vaccines. It put out more money than everybody else put together. That’s nothing to do with this administration. The U.S. always took these issues more seriously, probably because we had the CDC. We have the scale with NIH and CDC to think about these things. And so the U.S. put out over $10 billion in R&D and funding of trials — that is a global benefit. There’s no royalty or restriction. But the only manufacturing that the U.S. has funded to date is for the United States. And so that makes us look kind of selfish. If we would just put in this extra $8 billion, $4 billion to help buy vaccines, $4 billion for therapeutics — I’m calling everybody in Congress who will listen to me and saying, if there is a supplemental bill or whatever the next bill is, give $4 billion to our vaccine alliance Gavi, give $4 billion to our Global Fund, so that you complement your R&D with the current money.  We don’t want to create a dilemma for the world where you have, say, vaccines that haven’t gone through the FDA that are being made available for free, and the ones that have gone through the FDA, there’s no procurement money for those vaccines. You don’t want to force the world to make that choice, because anything where a vaccine doesn’t work, or has a side effect, worsens people’s willingness to take vaccines in general. And the reason we’ve gone from having over 10 million kids a year die every year down to less than 5 million, that’s because of uptake of vaccines and new vaccines. So that is worth preserving.  So how quickly do you think we will be able to roll out the vaccines, globally and equitably? Are we talking about something that’s going to take all of 2021? Will it stretch into 2022?  It’ll stretch. Unless you get herd immunity at really surprising levels, like 20 or 30 percent, you’ve got 7 billion people, each of them needing two doses each — a few of the vaccines might be one dose, but most of these early ones look like two doses. So that’s 14 billion doses to administer. We don’t make anything at that volume. So even if 80 percent of all the vaccines get approved and we get all this capacity, to get the eradication it stretches into 2022. You hope it doesn’t stretch past 2022.  That’s a long time. It’s also globally. What about more locally?  We should be able to bring this to an end, in rich countries, in 2021. Then in the world in 2022."

Taiwan’s long struggle for international recognition in the face of Chinese resistance gained unprecedented attention during the coronavirus pandemic, due to the exclusion of the island nation from the World Health Organization. Taiwan’s bird lovers are now joining in that fight.  The Chinese Wild Bird Federation (CWBF), Taiwan’s biggest bird conservation group, said in a statement today that it no longer has ties to Birdlife International, a Cambridge, UK-based non-governmental organization. CWBF said that BirdLife decided on Sept. 7 to remove it as a partner after the Taiwanese group refused to meet requests including that it sign a document committing to not promoting Taiwanese independence, and to change its name in Chinese, which translates as “Republic of China Wild Bird Federation.”  According to CWBF, BirdLife also said the Taiwanese group posed a risk to the organization, and that it would no longer participate in Taiwan government-funded events as “it would be ‘odd’ for BirdLife to distance itself from the ‘independence agenda’ of the Republic of China” while continuing to benefit from funding. It wasn’t clear from the statement the precise reasons that led to BirdLife’s decision.  The “Republic of China” was the name of the government that once controlled China before it fled to Taiwan after being defeated in the civil war in 1949, and it remains Taiwan’s official name. The moniker, which has long been the subject of debate in Taiwan, became especially problematic in recent months as it sought to distance itself from China amid growing international recognition of its success in fighting the coronavirus. Lawmakers earlier voted, for example, to revamp the country’s national carrier, China Airlines, in order to highlight Taiwan’s identity as separate to that of China. An upcoming passport redesign seeks to do the same.  Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory though the Communist Party has never ruled there, and has sought to squeeze Taiwan from participation in international organizations and events of all kinds. At the highest level, this means that Taiwan is unable to take part in United Nations bodies while it must compete in the Olympics under the name Chinese Taipei. But much more mundane examples of China’s pressure campaign also abound.  In 2018, the local council in Rockhampton, a small city in Australia, covered up small Taiwanese flags that had been painted by kids on a sculpture of a bull ahead of a major international beef industry event. Myriad global companies have had to apologize for inadvertently suggesting that Taiwan is a separate country on their websites or products.  According to Richard Foster, a long-time Taiwan resident and birding guide, pressure has been building in recent years to squeeze out Taiwanese participation in birding and conservation activities, including the exclusion of Taiwanese speakers and papers at events. He highlighted the example of Taiwan’s contributions to protecting the habitats of the Black-faced spoonbill, a species native to east Asia that winters in Taiwan. “Taiwan’s been doing virtually all the work, but just had to turn a blind eye to the fact that some international organizations have been forced into denying its contributions,” he said.  Taiwan’s forestry bureau has also been donating money annually to BirdLife’s conservation projects in Madagascar, Cambodia, and São Tomé and Príncipe.  The CWBF has, in fact, undergone three name changes in English in order to comply with pressure from BirdLife since becoming a partner of BirdLife in 1996. At one point, the group was named Wild Bird Federation Taiwan (link in Chinese). On BirdLife International’s website, the CWBF’s page—which once represented “Chinese Taiwan”—has been removed. The only partner from China listed by BirdLife is the Hong Kong Birdwatching Society.  BirdLife International did not respond to a request for comment on the expulsion of CWBF, or questions on the status of the conservation projects funded by Taiwan. In a comment to the Daily Telegraph newspaper, BirdLife said it was “inappropriate for us to comment publicly on matters relating to, and interactions with, partner organizations.”  While the pressure on Taiwanese conservation “fits in with a pattern of China…bullying Taiwan in every aspect of its international space,” Foster said what happened to CWBF is a “particular tragedy” for its politicization of environmental protections. “So much of birding and bird life involves migration and travel between different areas. Birds do not care about borders.”  The image at the top of this article was taken by Changhua Coast Conservation Action and shared under the Creative Commons license under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0."

Norsa also pointed to another winning asset in his eyes: the brand’s “special place in the heart of consumers, especially in Asia,” which he sees as “a big advantage” over some competitors.  More from WWD  To be sure, Asia Pacific has long been Ferragamo’s main market, representing 44.3 percent of total sales in the first half, even though it saw a 39.9 percent decrease in sales in the period, which amounted to 166.7 million euros. In the second quarter, the retail channel in China recovered, recording revenue growth of 11.6 percent at constant exchange rates, as it did in South Korea.  These were silver linings for Ferragamo, as it reported a six-month period ended June 30 impacted by the lockdown enforced in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which dragged down its top and bottom lines. The company posted a net loss of 86 million euros, including a minority interest, which compares with a profit of 60 million euros in the same period last year.  Revenues fell 46.6 percent to 377 million euros, compared with 705 million euros at the end of June last year.  Sales in the retail channel were down 41 percent to 260.6 million euros, accounting for 69.2 percent of the total, while the wholesale channel reported a 56.4 percent decrease to 110.9 million euros, mainly penalized by the performance of the travel-retail channel in the second quarter and by the fragrance division.  As of June 30, the group counted 643 points of sales, including 389 directly operated stores.  Norsa said he was “very pleased” to be back at the company he exited in 2016 after helming it for 10 years and responded candidly to an analyst about his return.  Story continues  “Leaving was mainly a personal reason as my wife was sick, but work is the best antidote, and I have had serious experiences consulting on boards, it’s very useful, I have a lot of information, I traveled a lot and I think I have more experience now. [Chairman] Ferruccio Ferragamo’s call was unexpected but I said yes right away, I find a balance with my other roles and I came with enthusiasm and joy. I found a wonderful team and I can be an important outside voice.”  Norsa shared the call with chief executive officer Micaela Le Divelec Lemmi and chief financial officer Alessandro Corsi, saying he had been working “in full harmony” with the ceo, the board shareholders and the management.  He admitted to the pressure felt, given the volatility and the uncertainties, but he had set out a series of priorities, such as a long-term financing credit line for a maximum amount of 250 million euros, which, as reported, is linked to the luxury brand hitting certain sustainability targets, and that will allow breathing room and investments over the next five years.  “We have put in place a significant process of streamlining the organization and reducing costs, and we need people to take on more responsibilities [according to the] double hatting principle.”  He was already pleased with “very satisfactory results that will drive us in 2021 with significant savings. We are facing an extremely volatile market and unpredictable events but we have opportunities in front of us to build future growth and transform our distribution.”  For example, Norsa sees opportunities for investments and to increase the brand’s presence in key cities in Mainland China and cited as “most interesting” the opening of Chinese borders to Macao, Hong Kong, Thailand and Cambodia after the pandemic.  “Nonstop flights have restarted to countries such as Canada and Denmark,” for example, he added on a positive note.  At the same time, he said he was looking carefully at markets such as Mexico and Taiwan, where the brand has a strong brand awareness and is well-positioned, he noted, as well as Russia and the Middle East.  Le Divelec Lemmi highlighted the actions taken so far, which despite the uncertainties, will help minimize the effects the pandemic had on 2020, in addition to the cash credit. “We have mitigated the stock in excess to protect the brand and keep our wholesale clean, and there has been a voluntary cut of management compensation,” she said.  The executive also pointed to a rationalization of the group’s store network, citing as an example the relocation of a banner in Canton Road in Hong Hong in early 2021, potential closures in Europe and in travel retail. “There is solid ground for growth, we plan five openings in China in second and third-tier cities, and to leverage pop-ups to engage customers.”  She also emphasized Ferragamo’s investments in its digital platform and communication and its omnichannel service. “We are not changing our priorities,” she added.  In the first half, the Japanese market registered a 37.4 percent decrease in sales, which fell to 36.9 million euros, hurt by a 56.1 percent decrease in the second quarter.  The Europe, Middle East and Africa region posted a 51.7 percent decrease to 85.8 million euros.  Revenues in North America fell 54.4 percent to 69.7 million euros, tumbling 81.1 percent in the second quarter. Norsa said he had been following the U.S. very closely, “with major changes in wholesale, which is now improving with solutions for department stores that will become more selective,” and offer better opportunities. He said the performance in the region was “mixed,” with cities such as New York being “abandoned,” but other areas such as Manhasset, Miami or Beverly Hills performing very well, although he did not deny the effects of “social turbulence.”  Sales in Central and South America dropped 54.6 percent to 17.4 million euros.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization decreased by 83.9 percent to 30 million euros from 184 million euros.  The operating loss stood at 74 million euros compared with an operating profit of 94 million euros in the same period last year.  By product category, sales of shoes fell 46.4 percent to 159.5 million euros, representing 42.4 percent of the total.  Leather goods and handbags fell 43.6 percent to 158.6 million euros, accounting for 42.1 percent of the total.  Ready-to-wear dropped 47.3 percent to 19.1 million euros, representing 5.1 percent of the total.  Fragrances were down 66.3 percent to 14.1 million euros, accounting for 3.7 percent of the total, also due to the postponement of the launch of products caused by the lockdown measures in the global markets.  Operating costs decreased 17.2 percent to 300 million euros, a consequence of the cost containment, the renegotiation of rents and the streamlining of the organization. Similarly, capital expenditures decreased 56.7 percent to 11 million euros.  As of June 30, the adjusted net financial position amounted to 58 million euros, net of the IFRS16 accounting effect, compared with 141 million euros at the end of June last year. Including the IFRS16 effect, the net financial position was negative for 562 million euros."

They were charged with organizing and brokering illegal emigration.  Phuong had organized the illegal entry and exit from Vietnam to Cambodia and vice versa in July using motorbikes and ferries. Each time someone crossed the border, Phuong would receive VND2 million ($86.44). Phuong also cooperated with Liem, in charge of transporting clients from Vietnam to Cambodia and vice versa, and paid him VND500,000 per shipment.  After getting caught red-handed while helping someone enter Vietnam from Cambodia on August 7, Phuong ran away, before turning himself in on August 14. Liem was arrested on August 18.  Phuong had helped 11 people enter and exit Vietnam illegally, earning VND28 million in the process. Liem had assisted three people to enter and exit Vietnam illegally, the court heard.  Dung confessed to have organized the illegal entry and exit into Vietnam of 20 people since May, earning VND39 million. He was further in charge of transporting people from Vietnam to Cambodia on behalf of another culprit, who paid Dung VND1.5 million per person. Dung had received VND5 million in total from this man, the court heard. He was arrested on August 7.  The Dak Lak group smuggled people across the Vietnam-China border.  Khanh contacted Lieu in 2017 to request her help in reaching the China border, which he planned to cross to obtain work. The duo succeeded.  In August 2018, Hang asked Khanh to help her husband and son cross the border. The latter then brought the husband to see Lieu at the border. Khanh earned VND4 million from the deal, while Lieu pocketed VND100,000. A month later, Hang and Khanh also successfully helped a couple bring their child to China where they planned to find jobs.  From August 2018 to April 2019, Khanh and Lieu had helped 21 Vietnamese illegally enter China for work. Hang meanwhile had helped six Vietnamese illegally enter China for the same purpose, the court heard. Khanh, Lieu, and Hang were arrested in February this year.  Vietnam has closed its borders since late March to keep out Covid-19. Everyone allowed to enter must remain in quarantine for 14 days."

After the country managed to bring the second wave of the pandemic under control, the transport ministry earlier this month proposed reopening flights to mainland China, Japan, and South Korea starting September 15, followed by Laos, Cambodia and Taiwan starting September 22. The ministry estimates the number of arrivals to be quarantined per week at about 5,000 in Hanoi and HCMC.  The flights will first serve foreign diplomats, officials, experts, business managers, and bring home Vietnamese from overseas. Passengers are yet to include tourists.  The arrivals will have to pay for their quarantine and Covid-19 tests.  Vietnamese carriers have announced plans to restore commercial international flights to certain locations, with Vietnam Airlines planning to operate one-way flights from Vietnam to Japan starting September 18. Bamboo Airways said Taiwan could be the first international market it plans to resume flights to in October, while Vietjet Air only has plans to resume its Hanoi-Taipei (Taiwan) service.  Vietnam has suspended all international flights since late March. The country has recorded 1,063 Covid-19 cases so far, 35 having succumbed to the disease. Many of the fatalities are elderly patients suffering underlying conditions like diabetes and kidney failure.  No local transmission has been recorded nationally in nearly two weeks."

Nguyen Tan Binh, director of the city Department of Health, said at a meeting to discuss the Covid-19 situation on Monday: ""The list will continue to be expanded to meet demand.""  Tourism and medical authorities have instructed the hotels to scrupulously apply Covid-19 preventive measures and not to take in regular guests.  The government in early September lifted the 14-day centralized quarantine requirement for foreign experts, investors, managers, and diplomats entering the country for less than 14 days, but still requires them to comply with all Covid-19 prevention measures including tests for Covid-19 and refraining from shaking hands.  The Transport Ministry earlier this month advised the government to resume commercial flights from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to Guangzhou in mainland China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Laos and Cambodia. The ministry estimates the number of arrivals to be quarantined per week at about 5,000 in Hanoi and HCMC.  All international flights had been suspended on March 25.  HCMC has gone over 40 days without a new case of domestic Covid-19 transmission. All 16 patients found infected since July 25, including eight who contracted it in the community, have been discharged. The country's second outbreak wave began on July 25 after 99 days without domestic infections.  There are currently 810 people in centralized quarantine in the city, of whom 505 are foreign experts housed in hotels while the rest are in city or district facilities.  City authorities recently conducted random tests on 382 senior citizens living in social protection centers, more than 1,500 people at wholesale markets and more than 500 workers at Taiwanese-backed footwear company Pouyuen, HCMC's biggest employer, in Binh Tan District. All tested negative for the disease.  City Vice Chairman Le Thanh Liem warned that though the outbreak is under control, local authorities should not be complacent because there is still a potential risk of community spread.  Vietnam’s Covid-19 count is currently at 1,063, of these 99 are active cases. The country has now gone 12 days without new domestic infections."

""If we were rational and well-governed, we would actually find a way through this without massive pain and suffering. The epidemic, for example, is itself controllable through rational policies,"" Sachs said during a virtual conference organized by a Philippine business group.  Sachs noted that other countries in the region have already kept the novel coronavirus ""essentially under control.""  ""In almost all of Southeast Asia, other than the Philippines and Indonesia, the virus is essentially under control. Because very serious public health efforts were made in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, and these have kept the transmission of the virus to a very low level,"" Sachs told the audience at the Management Association of the Philippines' (MAP) CEO Conference 2020.  He said the Philippines can learn from its surrounding neighbors in addressing the health crisis.  ""So the good news is it's possible to control this pandemic. And I very much hope that the Philippines could very much learn from the neighbors all around you.""  Despite implementing one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in the world, the Philippines has seen the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia.  It also suffered a deeper economic contraction that its neighbors in the second quarter.  For economies to quickly recover, Sachs said digitalization has also become more crucial.  ""The digital age is upending the way the world economy works, those who are in a strong position to be in the digital era are getting ahead,"" Sachs said.  Digitalization however “requires a serious program of action to ensure digital coverage for all people,” he said.  “We don't have that in the United States and, I'm afraid the same is true in the Philippines and other countries as well. It's a matter of governance.""  Sachs also asserted that the pandemic stems from the environmental crisis that the world is facing.  ""The fact that we have this epidemic disease is itself part of the environmental crisis, because as you know we're having wave after wave of newly emerging diseases that result from the way human beings are intervening in the environmental systems.""  He also urged the Philippines to quickly shift into renewable energy.  Meanwhile, Sachs scored US President Donald Trump over his handling of the pandemic. He warned the US is losing its status as a world leader.  ""The complete incompetence of the US government, however, shows that the United States cannot lead anymore,"" Sachs said.  ""And the nationalism and selfishness of the Trump strategy of 'America First' show that the United States is not worthy of the leadership anymore.""  ""Once again, if we had serious, rational, consequent governance in our countries, we would be making a steady transformation in the right direction,"" he admitted.  Sachs is the Director at the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. He teaches economics at Columbia University is a bestselling author, and an acknowledged global leader in sustainable development.  Time magazine listed Sachs twice in its 100 most influential world leaders, and called him “the world’s best-known economist.” The New York Times has also called Sachs “probably the most important economist in the world.”"

We searched 6 electronic databases for peer-reviewed, quantitative studies from inception to 26 April 2020. Study quality was assessed with the Centre for Evidence-Based Management (CEBM) Critical Appraisal Tool. Pooled prevalence estimates were calculated for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal behaviour. Meta-analyses examined associations between these disorders and violence, alcohol/drug use, condom use, and HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI). A total of 1,046 studies were identified, and 68 papers reporting on 56 unique studies were eligible for inclusion. These were geographically diverse (26 countries), representing all LMIC regions, and included 24,940 participants. All studies were cross-sectional and used a range of measurement tools; none reported a mental health intervention. Of the 56 studies, 14 scored as strong quality, 34 scored as moderate, and 8 scored as weak. The average age of participants was 28.9 years (age range: 11–64 years), with just under half (46%) having up to primary education or less. The pooled prevalence rates for mental disorders among FSWs in LMICs were as follows: depression 41.8% (95% CI 35.8%–48.0%), anxiety 21.0% (95% CI: 4.8%–58.4%), PTSD 19.7% (95% CI 3.2%–64.6%), psychological distress 40.8% (95% CI 20.7%–64.4%), recent suicide ideation 22.8% (95% CI 13.2%–36.5%), and recent suicide attempt 6.3% (95% CI 3.4%–11.4%). Meta-analyses found significant associations between violence experience and depression, violence experience and recent suicidal behaviour, alcohol use and recent suicidal behaviour, illicit drug use and depression, depression and inconsistent condom use with clients, and depression and HIV infection. Key study limitations include a paucity of longitudinal studies (necessary to assess causality), non-random sampling of participants by many studies, and the use of different measurement tools and cut-off scores to measure mental health problems and other common risk factors.  Sex work—defined by The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) as the receipt of money or goods in exchange for sexual services, either regularly or occasionally [ 7 ]—is criminalised in most regions of the world [ 8 ]. In addition to the social determinants described earlier, women who sell sex face a unique set of structural factors including police harassment and arrests, discrimination, marginalization, poverty, and gender inequality [ 8 , 9 ], as well as extreme occupational hazards such as violence, coercion, deception, alcohol and substance use, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted infection (STI) [ 10 ]. Together, these predispose female sex workers (FSWs) to increased psychological health vulnerabilities. Structural and occupational risks associated with sex work are highly dependent on sociocultural and economic contexts, which means that these hazards may differ for sex workers in LMICs and those in high-income countries. Evidence from high-income countries indicates a high prevalence of mental health morbidity among FSWs, especially post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and psychological distress [ 11 – 14 ]. Three previous reviews have examined mental health in the context of STIs/HIV, alcohol use, and violence against sex workers [ 15 – 17 ]. However, no attempt has been made to date to synthesise the evidence or estimate the burden of mental health disorders for FSWs. This is vital to inform policy and programming at the global and country level. The aim of this systematic review is to estimate the prevalence of mental disorders among FSWs in LMICs, and to examine associations with factors that commonly affect their health and well-being (violence, alcohol and drug use, condom use, HIV/STI).  Mental health problems are a significant cause of the global burden of disease. In 2010, mental, neurological, and substance use disorders were the leading cause of years lived with disability globally [ 1 ]. Worldwide, an estimated 300 million people are affected by depression, and 272 million people by anxiety, with women at higher risk compared with men [ 2 , 3 ]. The treatment gap for common conditions exceeds more than 90% in low-income countries [ 4 ]. Left untreated, mental disorders prevent people from reaching their full potential, impair human capital, and are associated with premature mortality from suicide and other illnesses [ 5 ]. Suicide is a health outcome strongly associated with mental, neurological, and substance use disorders. Nearly 800,000 people are estimated to die due to suicide each year, with 79% of global suicides occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [ 6 ]. A range of social determinants affect the risk and outcome of mental disorders. These include demographic factors (such as age, gender, and ethnicity), socioeconomic factors (such as low income, unemployment, and low education), neighbourhood factors (such as inadequate housing and neighbourhood violence), and social change associated with changes in income and urbanisation [ 1 ].  A narrative synthesis was conducted across all studies meeting inclusion criteria. Prevalence estimates were calculated from percentages or raw proportions, and we contacted authors of studies in which raw data were missing. If multiple publications reported results from a single study, we included all studies in Table 1 but only the original study in the narrative synthesis and prevalence analyses. Meta-analyses were conducted on studies that scored moderate to strong in the quality assessment and that used validated measures to assess mental health outcomes; we excluded studies from the meta-analyses that sampled participants based on characteristics that are known to be an independent risk factor for mental health problems (such as injecting drug use or HIV status) and could therefore bias the pooled mental health estimates. Analyses were completed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). Pooled estimates were calculated using a random effects model. Variation between studies was determined by heterogeneity tests with the Higgins’ I 2 statistic. Relative weights were calculated using the formula 1/V + T 2 where V is the error variance and T 2 (Tau-squared) is the between-study variance. Subgroup analyses were completed to examine associations between mental health outcomes (e.g., depression) and the following covariates: violence/police arrest, alcohol/drug use, condom use, and HIV/STI. Due to variations between studies in the factors adjusted for in multivariate analyses, unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were extracted or calculated from raw data. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using a random-effects model.  Study quality was assessed by authors (TB, BS, and AM) using the Centre for Evidence-Based Management (CEBM) Critical Appraisal for Cross-Sectional Surveys Tool ( S2 Text ). One item on CEBM was removed (Item 12: “Can the results be applied to your organisation?”) as it was not applicable to this review. To assess quality of studies, authors rated each article on 11 items, and an overall score was calculated, with higher scores indicating stronger quality. Studies scoring ≥7 out of 11 points were considered strong quality, between 5 and 7 were rated moderate quality, and ≤4 were scored as weak quality. Individual scores are presented in Table 1 , and detailed scoring of each study is presented in S3 Text .  All publications were screened by 2 independent reviewers (TB and BS). If either author classed a publication as relevant, the abstract was reviewed, with any disagreements discussed and a consensus reached. If eligibility could not be determined by screening of the title and abstract, the authors reviewed the full text. Three authors (BS, TB, and AM) assessed full texts using the eligibility criteria cited earlier, with any discrepancies resolved through discussion. Data were extracted by 3 authors (TB, BS, and AM) into a structured data extraction sheet.  Articles were included that measured the prevalence or incidence of mental health problems among FSWs, even if sex workers were not the main focus of the study. Only studies from countries defined as low or middle income, in accordance with the World Bank income groups 2019 [ 18 ], were included. Eligible studies had to be peer-reviewed, include females aged 16 or older who were actively engaged in sex work, and include the following study designs: cross-sectional survey, case–control study, cohort study, case series analysis, or experimental study with baseline measures for mental health. Studies were limited to English. We excluded studies that used qualitative methods only, were review papers, were conference abstracts, or were non–peer-reviewed publications. Studies exclusively focused on alcohol and substance use or victims of human trafficking sold into sex work were excluded from this review as reviews have recently been published in these areas [ 17 , 19 – 21 ]. Studies focused on women engaged in transactional sex only were ineligible for review, as this practice—and its implications on health—is distinct from sex work [ 22 ].  The review protocol has been registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016049179 ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ ). Ethics approval was not required for this study. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines ( Fig 1 ; S1 Prisma Checklist ). We searched electronic peer-reviewed literature databases (Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science) from first record until 26 April 2020. Search terms included the following: “mental health” OR “mental well-being” OR “psycholog* health” OR “psycholog* distress” OR “mental illness*” OR “mental disorder*” OR “mental health problem*” OR “psychiatr* morbidit*” OR “anxiety” OR “depress*” OR “suicid*” OR “trauma” OR “post-traumatic stress disorder” OR “PTSD”; “sex work*” OR “female sex work*” OR “prostitut*” OR “female prostitut*” OR “sex trad*” OR “transact* sex” OR “FSW*” OR “commercial sex” OR “sex-trade worker*”; “low and middle income countr*” OR “LAMIC*” OR “LMIC*” OR “developing countr*” OR “names of all countries which fit the LMIC criteria.” See S1 Text for full database list and search strategy.  Eight studies reported on HIV/STI and mental health problems [ 36 , 44 , 47 – 49 , 60 , 69 , 73 ]. One study [ 48 ] was excluded from the meta-analyses because it did not use a validated tool to measure depression, and one study was excluded because it only sampled HIV-negative women [ 44 ]. The pooled unadjusted OR for depression and HIV is 1.4 (1.1–1.8), p = 0.005 (n = 4 studies from 5 countries) and for suicidal ideation and HIV is 1.4 (1.1–1.8), p = 0.04 (n = 2 studies from 3 countries) ( S4 Fig ). One study reported associations between depression and current syphilis infection; the unadjusted OR was 0.6 (0.3–1.2), p = 0.1 [ 60 ].  Nine studies reported on mental health problems and condom use with clients and regular partners [ 24 , 53 , 56 , 60 , 62 , 68 , 71 , 80 , 84 ]. Condom use measurement varied with studies either reporting frequency of condom use (always versus not always) or condom use at last sex (yes/no). The pooled unadjusted OR for depression and inconsistent condom use with clients is 1.6 (1.2–2.1), p = 0.001 (n = 6 studies) ( S3 Fig ). The pooled unadjusted OR for depression and inconsistent condom use with a regular partner is 0.7 (0.3–1.9), p = 0.5 (n = 2 studies) ( S3 Fig ). One study reported on recent suicide attempt and inconsistent condom use with clients; the unadjusted OR was 4.3 (2.1–8.7), p < 0.001.  Associations between mental health problems and alcohol use were reported by 6 studies, but there was marked variation in how alcohol use was measured, with 2 studies asking about alcohol use in the past 30 days [ 53 ] or alcohol intoxication in the past 6 months [ 56 ] and 4 studies using Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) to measure hazardous, harmful, or dependent drinking [ 44 , 73 , 84 ] or severe binge drinking [ 46 ] ( Table 2 ). The pooled unadjusted OR for depression and alcohol use is 1.6 (0.8–3.1), p = 0.2 (n = 4 studies) ( S2 Fig ); when the outlier study is removed from the analyses, the pooled unadjusted OR is 2.1 (1.4–3.2), p < 0.001 (n = 3 studies) ( S2 Fig ). Psychological distress and harmful drinking was reported by one study (unadjusted OR 1.0 [0.7–1.4], p = 1.0) [ 73 ]. The pooled unadjusted OR of recent suicide ideation and alcohol use is 1.6 (1.0–2.5), p = 0.03 (n = 2 studies) ( S2 Fig ); one study reported associations between a recent suicide attempt and alcohol use, with an unadjusted OR of 2.8 (1.4–5.5), p = 0.003.  Three studies reported on police violence (harassment, arrest, or raids) and mental health problems ( Table 2 ). While no association was found between police harassment (ever) and current depression (unadjusted OR 0.9 [0.4–2.3], p = 0.9) [ 49 ], police arrest (ever) was associated with current depression in one study by Patel and colleagues (unadjusted OR 2.2 [1.7–2.8], p < 0.001) [ 53 ], and police raid in the past year was associated with a suicide attempt in the past 3 months (unadjusted OR 2.3 [1.2–4.3], p = 0.01) in a study by Shahmanesh and colleagues [ 80 ].  Seventeen studies reported on associations between mental health problems and violence experience [ 30 , 34 , 36 , 37 , 39 , 43 , 44 , 46 , 49 , 52 , 53 , 57 , 59 , 75 , 79 , 80 , 82 ], usually by an intimate partner or a client ( Table 2 ). Measures of violence varied by timeframe (recent versus ever), typology (physical, sexual, emotional) and perpetrator (client, intimate partner, etc.). Overall, 13 studies reported associations between depression and violence [ 34 , 37 , 39 , 43 , 44 , 46 , 49 , 52 , 53 , 59 , 79 , 83 ], with 7 studies included in the meta-analyses ( S1 Fig ). The pooled unadjusted OR of depression and violence experience (ever or recent) is 2.2 (1.4–3.3), p < 0.001 (n = 7 studies), and the pooled unadjusted OR of depression and recent violence experience is 2.3 (1.3–4.2), p = 0.005 (n = 5 studies). Two studies [ 43 , 46 ] reported associations between PTSD and violence experience (ever or recent), with only one of these eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis (unadjusted OR is 1.5 [0.8–2.6], p = 0.13) [ 46 ]. One study [ 30 ] with HIV-negative FSWs reported associations between psychological distress and recent violence by clients (unadjusted OR 2.0 [1.6–2.4], p < 0.001). One study reported suicide ideation ever and physical (unadjusted OR 1.7 [1.2–2.5], p = 0.008) or sexual violence experience ever (unadjusted OR 2.9 [2.0–4.2], p < 0.001) [ 36 ], and 2 studies reported recent suicidal ideation and violence experience (ever or recent), with only one of these eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis (unadjusted OR 2.5 [1.3–4.7], p = 0.004) [ 79 ]. Three studies reported recent suicide attempt and violence experience (ever or recent), with 2 of these eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis ( S1 Fig ). The pooled unadjusted OR of recent suicide attempt and violence experience (ever or recent) is 3.5 [2.2–5.5], p < 0.001.  Seventeen studies reported on suicidal ideation [ 10 , 36 , 39 , 46 , 47 , 55 , 57 , 58 , 61 , 69 , 71 , 75 – 80 ]. Most assessed suicidal ideation by asking about suicidal thoughts, for example, “have you thought about killing yourself?” and “have you ever felt like you wanted to end your life?” For the meta-analysis, we divided studies based on timeframe into ‘recent’ or ‘ever’ suicidal ideation and removed 3 studies due to limitations in how questions were operationalized [ 46 , 47 ], including one study that combined suicidal thoughts with attempting suicide [ 65 ]. The pooled prevalence of recent (past 3 months, 6 months, or year) suicide ideation is 22.8% (95% CI 13.2%–36.5%) (n = 6 studies from 7 countries) ( Fig 6 ). The pooled prevalence of lifetime suicidal ideation is 24.9% (95% CI 15.0%–38.3%) (n = 6 studies) ( Fig 7 ). Eight studies reported on suicide attempts among FSWs [ 39 , 46 , 55 , 57 , 58 , 71 , 79 , 80 ]. The majority assessed suicide attempts through one binary question (yes/no) asking whether the participant had attempted suicide. Prevalence of recent suicide attempt (past 3 months, 6 months, or year) was reported by 6 studies included in the meta-analysis ( Fig 8 ). The pooled prevalence of recent suicide attempts among FSWs from LMICs is 6.3% (95% CI 3.4–11.4%). Only one study reporting on ever suicide attempt was eligible for inclusion in a meta analyses and thus a pooled prevalence estimate is not available. This study reported a prevalence of lifetime suicide attempt of 4.8% (95% CI 3.6%–6.3%) [ 81 ].  The mean age of FSWs in the 42 studies that reported this was 28.9 years (age range: 11–64 years). Thirty-two studies reported sex work locations for their sample; among these studies, 66.3% of FSWs worked in brothels, lodges, bars, or other entertainment establishments; 51.7% worked in streets or public places; 24.7% worked at home; and 36.7% worked in other settings, e.g., via mobile phones (these categories were not mutually exclusive). Thirty-one studies reported education levels of their sample, and among these, nearly one-half of FSWs (45.7%) had an education level of primary school or less. Among the 40 studies that reported marital status for their sample, 48% of FSWs were never married; 32.9% were currently married or in a relationship; and 24.5% were divorced, separated, or widowed.  Studies were based in 26 LMICs: 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 1 in the Middle East and north Africa region, 1 in Eastern Europe, 2 in South East Asia, 5 in the Western Pacific region, and 4 in Latin America and the Caribbean. Eleven studies reported findings from countries in the low-income group, 20 studies from the low-middle income group, and 26 studies from the upper-middle income group, as per the World Bank income classification. Twenty-nine studies used a purposive sample, 14 used respondent driven sampling techniques, 7 used a random sample, and 6 utilized random sampling techniques to select venues and purposive methodology to recruit FSWs within these venues ( Table 1 ). Most studies recruited FSWs from a variety of venues, such as streets, bars, brothels, and entertainment establishments, with 3 studies selecting women from clinics or hospital settings [ 26 , 32 , 33 ]. All studies were cross-sectional, with 3 studies including qualitative data alongside survey results [ 34 – 36 ]. Of the 56 studies, 14 scored as strong quality, 34 scored as moderate, and 8 scored as weak ( S3 Text ). Sixteen studies (14 moderate; 2 weak) selected participants based on harmful alcohol or drug use (n = 9) [ 24 , 26 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 37 – 40 ], or positive [ 32 , 41 ] or negative [ 29 , 42 – 45 ] HIV status (n = 5), and were excluded from the meta-analyses (regardless of CEBM score) to avoid biasing the pooled estimates. Analyses used a variety of validated scales and cut-off points to assess mental disorders ( Table 1 ). None reported a mental health intervention.  The initial electronic search yielded 1,035 results, with 11 more studies identified through reference list screening and online searches. After duplicate records were removed, the titles and abstracts of 630 publications were screened for eligibility. Of those, 208 were identified as potentially relevant publications and reviewed for inclusion. Sixty-eight papers reporting on 56 unique studies with 24,940 participants meeting the inclusion criteria ( Fig 1 ). Eight of these studies did not provide prevalence data on mental health [ 23 – 31 ]; authors of these studies were contacted twice for further information, and 2 authors responded, providing prevalence data [ 23 , 27 ]. In total, 86 prevalence estimates from 48 studies were available (depression n = 37; anxiety n = 7; PTSD n = 8; suicide attempt n = 8; suicide ideation n = 17; psychological distress n = 7; mood disorders n = 2) ( Table 1 ).  Discussion  In this systematic review and meta-analysis using data from 56 studies and 24,940 participants, we found that mental health problems are highly prevalent among FSWs in LMICs and are strongly associated with social and behavioural factors commonly experienced by FSWs. Of note, all studies were cross-sectional, and not a single intervention study designed to address mental disorders among FSWs was identified. The prevalence of mental disorders among FSWs in LMICs was much higher compared with the general population in LMICs. For example, data from 41 LMICs from the 2002–2004 World Health Survey found the prevalence of depression to range between 3.9% and 7.8%, with higher rates among women (7.0%–7.8%) compared with men (3.9%–4.9%) [87]. Additionally, the 12-month prevalence of suicidal behaviour among people in LMICs has been reported to be 2% for suicidal ideation and 0.4% for suicide attempts, with rates higher among women compared with men (ideation: 2.4% women versus 1.6% men; attempt: 0.5% women versus 0.4% men) [88]. FSWs face increased levels of key risk factors for mental disorders and suicidal behaviour, including financial stress, low education, inadequate housing, violence, alcohol and drug use, STIs including HIV, and stigma and discrimination [15, 17, 53, 67], which may help explain the higher prevalence of mental health problems in comparison with the general population. Indeed, findings from our meta-analyses support this hypothesis. Understanding how these social determinants interact with mental disorders and which are modifiable within programmatic timeframes will be crucial to designing holistic interventions for FSWs.  This review adhered to PRISMA guidelines and used a comprehensive search strategy, independent screening and quality appraisal of studies. This study had some limitations. By limiting the search to published studies only, and to literature written in English, we may have missed key studies. We used unadjusted ORs to examine associations between mental health problems and key risk factors to allow like-for-like comparisons between studies; not adjusting for potential confounders may have biased the findings although unadjusted and adjusted ORs were usually similar in individual studies. Where individual studies provided multiple estimates on co-linear outcomes (e.g., depression and violence; depression and police arrest), using unadjusted ORs to calculate the individual associations may have led to participants who had not experienced one outcome (e.g., police arrest) but who had experienced the other (e.g., violence) being included in the reference group and subsequent underestimation of the true association. The removal of studies that sampled participants based on characteristics that are known to be an independent risk factor for mental health problems (such as HIV status, harmful alcohol use) led to fewer studies being included and wider confidence intervals around prevalence estimates and pooled ORs. However, when we re-ran the analyses to include all qualifying studies, regardless of sampling criteria, we did indeed find that estimates were slightly higher, suggesting that inclusion of these studies would have led to an overestimation of the pooled estimates and associations. Several methodological issues across the studies were also observed. All studies were cross-sectional. Longitudinal studies are needed to ascertain direction of causality between mental health problems and other factors common to FSWs, although studies with the general population suggest that these relationships are likely to be bidirectional [89]. Most studies used nonprobability sampling across a wide variety of settings which may introduce selection bias and mean that the most vulnerable women will be missed from these surveys. This in turn may lead to underestimations of mental health estimates. A range of measurement tools was used to capture mental health outcomes, as well as violence, alcohol and drug use, and condom use. Even when studies used the same mental health outcome measures, different cut-off scores were applied. This limits the comparability and reliability of findings across studies and points to a need for establishing more rigorous guidelines on using validated tools with this study population.  To our knowledge, this systematic review is the first globally to estimate the prevalence of mental health problems among FSWs in LMICs and to examine associations between poor mental health and other risk factors common in sex workers’ lives. Our findings and meta-analyses suggest that FSWs experience a high burden of depression, anxiety, PTSD, psychological distress, and suicidal behaviours and that poor mental health is strongly associated with violence experience, drug use, inconsistent condom use, and HIV/STI. Together, this supports the concept of overlapping vulnerabilities and has several important implications.  First, there are no existing studies that we are aware of that describe mental health interventions; low-cost, effective interventions for FSWs with mental health disorders are urgently needed. Among the general population attending primary care services in India and elsewhere, brief psychological interventions delivered by trained lay-counsellors have been shown to effectively treat depression [90,91]. Strategies to prevent suicide could include promoting mental health, limiting access to the means for suicide, reducing harmful alcohol use and violence experience, and training “gatekeepers” to support women at increased risk, such as those who have previously attempted suicide [6]. Such interventions should also be suitable for FSWs and could be adapted and embedded within existing HIV service provision. Second, the strong associations between mental health disorders and key occupational risk factors such as violence and harmful alcohol and drug use support the need for upstream structural interventions as part of holistic HIV prevention programming for FSWs. Again, violence interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing violence among women in LMICs [92,93] as well as among FSWs [94]. Low-cost, brief psychological interventions to treat harmful alcohol use could also be adapted to FSW settings [95]. Third, strong associations between poor mental health and reduced condom use with clients and with HIV infection suggest that treatment of mental health problems may also improve condom use with clients and the sexual and reproductive health of FSWs. In addition, women diagnosed with HIV may require on-going counselling and support, for example, by HIV testing and screening counsellors or FSW peer advocates, which goes beyond CD4 counts and treatment adherence, to also enquire about a woman’s ongoing psychological well-being."

Campaigners estimate more than 100,000 victims from the war and its aftermath remain buried in unmarked graves across Spain — a figure, according to Amnesty International, only exceeded by Cambodia.  The so-called ""Law on Democratic Memory"" which Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's cabinet approved Tuesday will make unearthing the mass graves a ""state responsibility"".  The bill, which still has to be approved by parliament, will also create a DNA database to help identify remains found in the mass graves, create a map of the mass graves and prevent publicly-funded institutions from glorifying the dictatorship.  Francisco Franco assumed power after the civil war in which his Nationalists defeated Republicans, leaving the country in ruins and mourning hundreds of thousands of dead.  While Franco's regime honoured its own dead, it left its opponents buried in unmarked graves scattered across the country.  The passage of time, and the lack of records about the executions, has made both finding and identifying victims difficult.  - Annul convictions -  The government will set aside 750,000 euros ($890,000) to finance the bill in 2020, with 60 percent earmarked for the search for the missing.  ""Memory, justice and reparation must be state matters. Today we take another step in recognising the victims of the Civil War and the dictatorship with the Law on Democratic Memory. Today we close the wounds a little bit more and can look at the past with greater dignity,"" Sanchez tweeted.  Under an earlier historical memory law passed by a previous socialist government in 2007, the state simply offered support to help families trace and exhume relatives buried in unmarked graves.  But that support was withdrawn after the conservative Popular Party came to power in 2011, claiming it needlessly opened old wounds.  Sanchez has made the rehabilitation of the victims of the era of dictator Francisco Franco one of his priorities since coming to power in 2018.  In October 2019 he had Franco's remains removed from a vast basilica in the Valley of the Fallen near Madrid where he was buried when he died in 1975, and transferred to a discreet family plot in El Pardo cemetery on the outskirts of the Spanish capital.  The bill approved Tuesday calls for Franco's former mausoleum at the Valley of the Fallen to be turned into an educational site about the war and the dictatorship.  It will also annul the criminal convictions of opponents of the dictatorship and appoint a prosecutor who will probe human rights abuses during the civil war and dictatorship.  - 'Scarecrow' -  Previous attempts to bring Franco-era officials to justice in Spain have been blocked by the amnesty agreement signed by political leaders after Franco's death.  The agreement was seen as essential to avoid a spiral of score-settling as they tried to unite the country and steer it towards democracy.  Spanish authorities still invoke the amnesty law in refusing to investigate alleged atrocities during the Franco era, despite demands by the United Nations that it be scrapped.  The right accuse Sanchez of using the draft bill to distract attention away from his poor handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed over 30,000 lives in Spain, one of the world's highest tolls.  ""Every time the government has problems, it brings out the scarecrow of Franco,"" said the spokesman for the main opposition conservative Popular Party in the Senate, Javier Maroto  © 2020 AFP"

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday said China’s state-owned companies engage in predatory business practices in the Mekong River region and the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for much of the boom in trafficking of persons, drugs and wildlife there.  The new U.S.-Mekong Partnership launched Friday will help combat these transnational crimes and will strengthen water security for partner countries where China’s manipulation of the river has exacerbated a drought, he said.  The U.S. is “concerned about infrastructure-linked debt and the predatory and opaque business practices of Beijing’s state-owned actors, such as China Communications Construction Co. (CCCC),” Pompeo said in a statement.  Last month, a senior State Department official also named CCCC when he said upstream damming pursued by Beijing in the Mekong River has been done in “a completely nontransparent and non-consultative way.”  “And there is a – actually a specific CCCC angle to the Mekong environmental concern story given CCCC’s role in would-be Chinese plans to blast and dredge the Mekong River, which could have potentially catastrophic effects on the downstream communities, the scores of millions of people whose livelihoods rely on the Mekong,” the official who was not named said during a special briefing.  On Monday, Pompeo also said companies and groups associated with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are linked to human and narcotics trafficking in the Mekong region. His statement did not provide evidence to support the allegation.  “Concerning also is the boom in trafficking of persons, drugs and wildlife, much of which emanates from organizations, companies and special economic zones linked to the CCP.”  Pompeo also said the CCP is withholding Mekong water, adding downstream countries must hold it accountable by asking it to share water data through the Mekong River Commission.  “The CCP’s unilateral decisions to withhold water upstream have exacerbated an historic drought,” he said.  “We encourage countries of the Mekong region to hold the CCP accountable to its pledge to share its water data. That data should be public. It should be released year-round. It should include water and water-related data, as well as land use, and dam construction and operation data.”  U.S. pledges $154 million to Mekong region  Countries of the Mekong – Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam – “deserve good partners,” Pompeo said.  The U.S. has pledged a total of $156.4 million for a host of initiatives under the U.S.-Mekong Partnership.  These include $52 million to support COVID-19 recovery, $55 million to counter transnational crime, $33 million to develop energy markets under Asia EDGE (Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy), $6.6 million to improving energy infrastructure and markets in the Mekong region, and $2 million to counter trafficking in persons.  These initiatives were announced Friday at the first U.S.-Mekong Partnership Ministerial Meeting held to launch the partnership. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen E. Biegun was the U.S. representative at the virtual meeting.  “The United States is committed to supporting the resilience and autonomy of countries in the Mekong region and will work with all partners who share our principled, transparent approach,” State Department spokesman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement after the meeting.  Pompeo said on Monday that the U.S. will also work closely “with partners like Japan, Australia, South Korea, India, and other good friends of the Mekong.”  The partnership’s launch Friday coincided with last week’s series of meetings at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ministerial summit.  Pompeo on Friday reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to Southeast Asia and ASEAN and accused China of “aggression” in the South China Sea.  “We stand with our ASEAN partners as we insist on the rule of law and respect for sovereignty in the South China Sea, where Beijing has pursued aggressive campaigns of coercion and environmental devastation,” Pompeo said in a statement released during the summit.

Gov. David Ige said Wednesday that travelers will have to take the test within 72 hours before their flight arrives in the islands. Ige says drug store operator CVS and healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente will conduct the tests.  The state has previously delayed the start of the pre-travel testing program twice as COVID-19 cases spiked on the U.S. mainland and in Hawaii.  Leaders hope pre-travel testing will encourage tourists to return while keeping residents safe.

That’s more than 20% of South Africa’s population of 58 million.  — The Big Ten Conference will give fall football a shot after all. It reversed a decision to push the season to spring after push back from lawmakers, coaches and parents and President Trump.  ___  Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  ___  HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:  MEXICO CITY — A Mexico City official says the capital had 20,535 “excess deaths” attributable to COVID-19 between April and August. That is almost double the official death toll of 11,318 reported for the pandemic in Mexico City.  Story continues  The head of the city’s Digital Innovation Agency says there were 30,462 “excess deaths” in the city between April 1 and the end of August, about two-thirds of which were determined to be due to coronavirus. David Merino wrote in his Twitter account that 92% of those deaths were in hospitals and 7% at private residences.  Like all of Mexico, the city of almost 9 million inhabitants has had an extremely low testing rate and officials acknowledge that the number of test-confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths probably undercounts the real figures.  ___  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is disagreeing with the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the potential availability of a coronavirus vaccine to the general public.  Trump promised Wednesday that a vaccine will be available much sooner than was projected in congressional testimony earlier in the day by Dr. Robert Redfield.  Trump says Redfield “made a mistake” when he told lawmakers that any vaccine available in November or December would be in “very limited supply,” and reserved for first responders and people most vulnerable to COVID-19. Redfield estimated the shot wouldn’t be broadly available until the spring or summer of 2021.  Trump is predicting a vaccine will be approved before voters go to the polls Nov. 3.  ___  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he disagrees with the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention telling lawmakers that wearing a mask is guaranteed to protect people more from the novel coronavirus than a vaccine.  Trump said at a White House news conference that a mask is “not more effective by any means than a vaccine, and I called him about that.”  Trump’s comments were the second time he questioned the testimony of the CDC’s Robert Redfield on Wednesday. Earlier, he said Redfield was wrong in his estimation of how fast a potential vaccine will be available to the general public.  Trump says that “I hope the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the mask.” He also says that “the mask perhaps helps.”  Trump says he still has confidence in Redfield.  ___  HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pennsylvania’s top lawyer is asking a federal judge to keep in place Gov. Tom Wolf’s limits on crowd size, arguing that allowing large groups to congregate “will result in people’s deaths” from the coronavirus.  The office of Attorney General Josh Shapiro urged U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV on Wednesday to delay enforcement of his ruling that many of the governor’s pandemic shutdown orders are unconstitutional.  Stickman has said the state’s size limits for indoor and outdoor gatherings violate citizens’ constitutional right to assemble. The state has been enforcing a gathering limit of 25 people for indoor events and 250 for those held outside.  Shapiro’s office says Stickman’s ruling “does not consider the manner in which COVID-19 is spread or the rationale for adopting the congregate limits.” Its points out that other federal judges and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court have upheld Wolf’s pandemic shutdown orders.  ___  COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio has enacted a law that bars local or state officials from closing churches or other houses of worship and that bans the changing of election dates.  The legislation signed Wednesday by Gov. Mike DeWine was pushed through by Republican lawmakers in reaction to such orders as part of coronavirus containment measures. DeWine had refrained from shutting down religious institutions during the pandemic, but some other governors have restricted religious gatherings.  The new law also takes aim at DeWine’s eleventh hour decision in March to postpone the state’s in-person primary because of concerns about the coronavirus. The statute forbids moving elections other than from the “time, place and manner” spelled out in state law.  ___  ANNAPOLIS, Md. — It will likely be at least six to eight months longer before a coronavirus vaccine can be distributed in a best-case scenario, leading Maryland health officials and lawmakers said as they make plans for the state.  Senate President Bill Ferguson said he spoke on Tuesday with one of the principal investigators at Johns Hopkins University who is working on a vaccine now in its third phase. While there has been remarkable progress, Ferguson said Wednesday that the logistics that go into distributing a vaccine are “enormous and herculean.”  “I think it’s really important that we keep that in mind moving forward as we make decisions about the future of Maryland — that even with an amazing light-speed approval, it is still six to eight months from that point until we’ll start to see the impact on herd immunity overall, so there is time to go in this ballgame,” Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said during a meeting of a legislative panel on the coronavirus.  Robert Neall, Maryland’s health secretary, emphasized that people need to be prepared to use available tools like masks and handwashing well into next year.  ___  BERLIN — Germany has declared three European capitals and several regions “risk areas” for coronavirus.  The Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the Austrian capital Vienna, Budapest in Hungary and the Dutch region that includes Amsterdam were added to the risk list due to high numbers of COVID-19 infections there.  Also listed were several regions in France, Romania, Croatia, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.  Travelers arriving in Germany from those locations have to go into mandatory quarantine and take a coronavirus test.  ___  ISTANBUL — Turkey’s health minister says Phase 3 trials for China’s Sinovac Biotech’s two-step vaccine have begun in Turkey with three Turkish health workers.  Fahrettin Koca said Wednesday the trial would expand to 1,200 volunteers and then to 10,000. He said trials for a Pfizer vaccine were also beginning and others were pending, adding that he hoped widespread vaccinations would start towards the end of 2020.  ___  UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations chief says the COVID-19 pandemic remains “out of control,” with the world approaching “the grimmest of milestones: 1 million lives lost to the virus.”  Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a news conference Wednesday that the coronavirus “is the number one global security threat in our world today,” posing a crisis that is “unlike any in our lifetimes.”  He said that’s why he called for a global cease-fire on March 23 to tackle the pandemic.  And in his speech to world leaders at next Tuesday’s mainly virtual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, Guterres said he will make “a strong appeal to the international community to mobilize all efforts for the global cease-fire to become a reality by the end of the year.”  The secretary-general urged the international community to come together to defeat the virus, stressing that a vaccine alone can’t solve the crisis.  ___  JOHANNESBURG — South Africa’s president says the country will reopen for international travel as of Oct. 1 after confirmed coronavirus cases have dropped dramatically in recent weeks.  President Cyril Ramaphosa says visitors may not be allowed from countries deemed at high risk and a list of countries will be published in the coming days.  Visitors will be required to show negative test results for the virus no older than 72 hours before departure. Those who didn’t test before departure will be required to stay in quarantine at their own cost.  International flights will be allowed only at the country’s three main airports in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.  ___  WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Wednesday was asked whether the White House was now counting on herd immunity to deal with the virus.  President Donald Trump said during an ABC News town hall on Tuesday that eventually there will be herd immunity to the virus, but that with a vaccine, the virus will go away “very quickly.”  For the United States to reach herd immunity against the coronavirus, most experts say, the nation would likely need to vaccinate roughly 70% of Americans.  “Herd immunity has never been a strategy here at the White House,” McEnany said. “The president last night was noting ... (that) over a period of time a country, a society, can reach herd immunity. It’s a fact. It was not a strategy ever presented here at the White House.""  ___  LONDON — The U.K. has recorded nearly 4,000 new coronavirus cases for the first time since May amid mounting concerns the country is on the verge of a second wave.  Government figures show new cases rising to 3,991, up markedly from Tuesday’s figure of 3,105. Though more testing is picking up more cases, it’s clear the virus is spreading. The latest daily increase is more than two times the level reported a few weeks back.  Officials recently banned social gatherings in England of more than six people both indoors and outdoors. Though many of the recent cases involve younger people, there are concerns more vulnerable people may become infected.  The government reported Wednesday another 20 people died within 28 days after testing positive for COVID-19, the new U.K. cutoff for official deaths instituted in the last few weeks.  That takes the death toll to 41,684, Europe’s highest and fifth highest in the world. On Aug. 20, the reported death toll in the U.K. was 41,483.  ___  BUDAPEST, Hungary — Hungary’s prime minister set a maximum price for coronavirus tests, extended mandatory use of face masks and ordered temperature checks at school for all students and teachers starting Oct. 1.  Viktor Orban says in a video posted on Facebook that tests cannot cost more than 19,500 forints ($64.50). Wearing masks, already obligatory on public transportation and stores, will be extended to theaters, cinemas, health care and social institutions, among others, and nightclubs must close at 11 p.m.  Orban says the health care system was prepared to deal with the second wave of the pandemic, with a plan to increase the availability of hospital beds and deploy doctors and nurses where needed.  ___  BERLIN — German public broadcaster ARD reports a far-right lawmaker in the national Parliament has tested positive for the coronavirus.  ARD quoted the Alternative for Germany party confirming Wednesday that Norbert Kleinwaechter was tested positive for COVID-19 and informed his caucus Tuesday. Six other lawmakers for the party and several parliamentary staff he’d been in contact with were sent home to isolate.  Some Alternative for Germany lawmakers took part in protests against pandemic restrictions in recent months.  Germany’s disease control center says the country recorded 1,901 new infections in the past day, taking the total to nearly 264,000. Germany has confirmed 9,368 COVID-related deaths since the start of the outbreak."

As holidaymakers and the travel industry wait nervously for the now-traditional Thursday afternoon announcement of nations to lose their quarantine exemption, Danish figures show one-third more new coronavirus cases today compared with the same day a week ago.  The status of each country is decided by the Department for Transport (DfT), and endorsed by the Foreign Office – which applies a “double lock” in the form of a warning against non-essential travel after the DfT has added a country or region to its quarantine list.  Following complaints from the travel industry about the lack of differentiation between parts of the same country, earlier this month the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “For the first time, we have the data and capacity to add or remove specific islands from quarantine, whilst providing maximum protection to UK public health.”  The travel consultancy The PC Agency, has analysed Wednesday’s data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and rates Denmark at 30.5 new cases per 100,000 people. The UK is currently at 32.5, but the threshold for losing quarantine exemption is 20.  Figures for Greece have been increasing slowly, and the national score stands at 17.7.  A requirements for holidaymakers to spend two weeks in self-isolation already applies for arrivals to England and Northern Ireland from seven Greek islands – of which some, including Santorini, Mykonos, Lesbos and Zante, have much higher rates than the average for Greece.  Wales applies quarantine for visitors to nine islands, while the whole of Greece is off-limits for Scottish travellers.  The hope among airlines, travel firms and Greek tourism officials is that low infection rates away from the named islands will mean there is no extension of quarantine.  Coronavirus in numbers  Last week, Portugal was returned to the no-go list after just three weeks. Hungary also lost its quarantine exemption.  The only three major beach destinations with no self-isolation requirements for returning UK visitors are Italy, Cyprus and Turkey.  Cyprus, which demands proof of a negative Covid-19 test from arriving British holidaymakers, has only 3.3 new cases per 100,000 people.  Italy has seen steady increases in new cases, and is currently on 16.3. Turkey is at 13.8 – though the reliability of its figures and the extent of testing has been questioned.  Neighbouring Bulgaria, currently at 12.9, has been well below the UK government’s threshold for weeks, but has not yet been granted quarantine exemption.  Poland, which is at 9.5, is likely to present a tempting autumn alternative for city breaks since Amsterdam, Barcelona and Paris, are all quarantine destinations.  Paul Charles, chief executive of The PC Agency, said: “Denmark has seen a significant enough jump in cases that it is very likely to be added to the quarantine list this week.  “Luckily for many tourists, mainland Greece, Italy and Turkey have kept an impressive lid on their infection numbers, so they are avoiding going anywhere near the quarantine ‘red zone’ for now.  “What’s frustrating for many consumers, and the travel sector, is why there aren’t more countries being removed from quarantine, especially long-haul destinations such as Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia and Rwanda?  “Removing these would be a major boost to confidence among travellers and enable airlines to increase their frequency to these destinations.  “It is also now questionable why all of Africa is off limits unless you wish to quarantine on your return.”"

The flights, however, are reserved for Vietnamese nationals, diplomats, experts, managers, skilled workers, investors and their families. They are not yet available for tourists.  According to a report on the government website, flights connecting Vietnam’s two largest cities — Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City — to destinations in South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan will operate on a weekly basis. Flights connecting the cities with Cambodia and Laos will resume next week.  To board a flight, passengers must hold a certificate showing they have tested negative for the coronavirus no more than five days before the departure date. Upon arrival, they will be tested and placed under quarantine, the report said.  Vietnam shut down international flights on April 1. National carrier Vietnam Airlines estimated last month that it would lose $650 million in 2020.  Vietnam has reported 1,059 cases of the coronavirus. It managed to avoid any deaths until July, when the virus crept into the city of Da Nang, killing 35 people.  But no new cases have been reported for two weeks. Last week, Da Nang lifted a travel restriction after two months.  Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region:  — India’s coronavirus confirmed cases crossed 5 million on Wednesday, still soaring and testing the country’s feeble health care system in tens of thousands of impoverished towns and villages. The Health Ministry reported 90,123 new cases in the past 24 hours, raising the nation’s confirmed total to 5,020,359, about 0.35% of its nearly 1.4 billion population. It said 1,290 more people died in the past 24 hours, for a total of 82,066. India’s total coronavirus caseload is closing in on the United States’ highest tally of more than 6.6 million cases and expected to surpass it within weeks. India reported a record daily high of 97,570 cases on Sept. 11 and has added more than 1 million cases this month alone.  — South Korea’s daily coronavirus tally has stayed below 200 for two weeks, but the government is urging people not to lower their guard. Authorities said Wednesday that the 113 cases added in the last 24 hours took the country’s total to 22,504, including 367 deaths. Eighty-one of them were in the Seoul metropolitan area, the heart of a recent viral resurgence in South Korea.

The recent surge in the US COVID-19 cases joins the pre-Fed caution to weigh on the pair.  Chinese Yuan cheers upbeat data at home, recovery from the pandemic.  Sino-American trade tussle continues with the WTO opposing American sanctions.  USD/CNH extends its four-day downward trajectory to 6.7682, with a 0.17% intraday loss, amid Wednesday’s initial trading on Chinese bourses. The offshore Yuan pair slumps to the lowest since May 2019 as the US dollar fails to keep the previous day’s recovery moves ahead of the key Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy decision.  Other than the US dollar consolidation, the mixed signals concerning the risk catalysts and a light calendar also weigh on the pair.  Following the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) verdict to term the Trump administration’s anti-trade measures on Beijing products, the US blacklists another Chinese firm that helps to build military weapons in Cambodia. On Tuesday, America canceled its ban on cotton and tomato imports from Xinjiang whereas the dragon nation extended tariff relief from the goods coming from Washington.  Also contributing to the pair’s strength could be the comments from the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China (NDRC). The state planner recently mentioned that it approved projects worth 88.2 billion Chinese Yuan in August. The Asian major has already rolled out intentions of self-reliance and the same will be official after October month’s meeting on the five-year plans.  Elsewhere, Texas registered the biggest jump in three weeks in the daily coronavirus (COVID-19) cases with 4,816 new numbers for Tuesday. While identifying the same, China’s Global Times (GT) says, “The yuan is showing an appreciation trend as China's economy rises and the dollar is battered by coronavirus.”  Looking forward, a lack of major data/events offers a little hope for any trend change and hence the bears are likely to dominate for a while. However, the trading momentum may shrink before the US central bank announcements.  Read: September FOMC Preview: Projections, projections, projections  Technical analysis  The early-May 2019 top surrounding 6.7510 is on the bears’ radars while a falling trend line from July 22, at 6.7545 now, can question the USD/CNH sellers afterward. Meanwhile, the monthly high of 6.8610 can restrict the pair’s short-term upside."

The Managing Director of MIFIDA with customers in Myanmar, where Gojo will be piloting the DFA (Photo: Gojo & Company, Inc.)  TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gojo & Company, Inc. (“Gojo”) is pleased to announce the successful additional close of its ongoing Series D financing of USD 19 million as of September 14, 2020. Gojo has successfully globalized its investor base by welcoming two international institutional investors as its investors for the first time.  Welcoming international institutional investors with strong expertise in the tech space  TGVest Capital, Baillie Gifford, Future Venture Capital (CVC of East Japan Bank), and several individual investors joined as Gojo investors in this financing round.  TGVest Capital is an Asia-based technology-focused private equity fund specializing in buyout and growth capital investments in companies. Baillie Gifford is an independent investment partnership based in Scotland, UK, with USD 324 billion of assets under management (as at 30 June 2020). Gojo will drive further digital transformation at our group companies’ operations as we gain further confidence in our capabilities through investments from international investors having extensive investment experience in the tech space.  We will continue to work towards the final close of the Series D financing. The newly raised funds will be mainly used for further growth and digitalization of its existing group companies in Cambodia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and India apart from future expansion to new markets in Asia and Africa.  Comments from international investors  TGVest Capital  DC Cheng, Chairman  “As a growth capital private equity fund, we are always interested in innovative businesses disrupting an industry with tech-enabled applications. Gojo represents a milestone in our quest to strengthen our Asian presence and ESG practice, and a truly remarkable one. Gojo’s mission to extend financial inclusion in less developed countries and its innovative approach to overcome long-existing industry bottlenecks have resonated with us from the beginning. We consider Gojo a pioneer in redefining the microfinance landscape and we believe its unique business model and tremendous growth potential make it an invaluable addition to our portfolio.”  Baillie Gifford  Praveen Kumar, Investment Manager (Japanese Equities)  “As long-term growth investors, we look for fast growing and disruptive young businesses addressing a large growth opportunity and employing a unique or genuinely differentiated business model. Gojo ticks all of these boxes and hence we decided to make an investment. We also like Gojo’s vision of improving financial access across some of the world’s poorest nations through microfinance and other forms of affordable lending. It is quite rare to come across a commercial enterprise like Gojo whose sole raison d'être is the upliftment of the poor and we wish the management team at Gojo all the success in their future endeavours.”  Comments from Taejun Shin, Founder and CEO of Gojo  “Under the travel restriction due to the impact of COVID-19, we had active discussions with TGVest and Baillie Gifford through a series of video conferences and in-depth due diligence processes. We believe the investments from sophisticated international institutional investors such as TGVest and Baillie Gifford indicates their trust in Gojo and confidence in Gojo’s growth potential. Despite the adverse economic environments, we have made many progress in our services with our technology team. We will keep working to extend financial service to the world.”  Accelerating digital transformation  Syam Nair, having previously worked at Visa and Mastercard in technology and digital leadership positions across the Asia Pacific region, joined as Gojo’s Chief Technology Officer in February to lead group’s digital transformation initiatives and technology team build-out. Gojo initiated digital transformation programs within all group companies to leverage digital technologies and business models enabling us to provide more convenient financial services to our clients.  Gojo launched the pilot of Digital Field Application (“DFA”) which was co-developed with MAXIMA, our group company in Cambodia aiming to accelerate digitalization and also reduce lead time in serving financial products to clients. The entire loan process, from registration to approval, was reduced to 40 minutes from what took days before. Gojo aims to deploy DFA that consists of a brand-new Android application that runs on tablets and sophisticated backend services in the group companies. An R&D team was newly formed to innovate and conceptualize new products for microfinance and their clients. The team is in the product ideation stage for many innovative concepts including digital savings and others.  Impact Measurement and Social Performance Management (SPM)  During the COVID-19 outbreak, Gojo shared SPM practices to be followed by group companies for client protection, such as rescheduling of loans and extending moratoriums on the collection of principal and interest.  Gojo released its first impact report in July, which reviews Gojo’s activities since the establishment. Gojo’s impact measurement team has also been planning the research design and operating model for a financial diaries project, which will give us insight into how clients use loans and manage their money. As a client-centric financial service provider, we strive to deliver better financial products and services to the clients so that we can support their goals.  About Gojo & Company  Gojo was founded to extend financial inclusion to everyone in the world beginning with the developing countries. Gojo encourages the formalization and growth of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. Our long-term goal is to enable the provision of high-quality affordable financial services for 100+ million unserved and underserved people in 50+ countries by 2030. Six years since our establishment, we work in Cambodia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and India with USD 260 million gross loan portfolio, 3,400+ employees, serving more than 570,000 clients."

Public Health Ontario’s chief of microbiology and laboratory science lists several issues to be resolved before broad provincial use but expects saliva collection will soon make it easier to detect infection, especially among children and others unable to tolerate a nasopharyngeal swab.  “I do foresee it being an option in the near term,” Dr. Vanessa Allen said in a recent interview.  “We’re aiming in the space of weeks to months. Sometime later this fall looks very probable.”  While not as accurate as the gold standard method — in which a long, flexible swab is inserted deep into the nostril — saliva collection is easier, meaning this approach could capture infections in people who otherwise would not be tested but should be, says Allen.  To be clear, these are not the at-home saliva tests that generate an immediate result, but lab-based tests that use the same molecular analysis to detect novel coronavirus in a nasopharyngeal sample.  6:14 p.m: The latest numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada reported by Canadian Press  There are 139,747 confirmed cases in Canada.

The most serious offenders — those who “flagrantly” disregard public health measures meant to curb the spread of COVID-19 — will be formally reviewed, said Patrick Deane, the principal of Queen’s University in Kingston, Ont.  “Should they be found guilty under the student code of conduct, they’ll be subject to sanctions as stipulated in the code,” Deane said. “Those sanctions do include the possibility of expulsion from the university.”  Deane said there would be due process before anyone is kicked out of the school, and such punishment would be reserved only for those who have seriously jeopardized public safety.  “When there are students who persist in flouting those regulations, obviously the university must have some kind of recourse against them,” he said.  The announcement came a day after the region’s top public health officer told Kingston city council that the school should take that action.  3 p.m.: Federal Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole says he, his family and some party workers are in self-isolation after an aide tested positive for COVID-19.  A statement from the party says the O’Tooles are getting tested, informing the Opposition leader’s recent contacts and keeping his son home.  “My family and I are feeling well, but we take COVID-19 very seriously,” O’Toole said in the statement.  “Today was going to be Jack’s first day back at school, but instead we will be getting tested and self-isolating per public health guidelines. The health and safety of my family and all Canadians is my top priority.”  O’Toole’s spokeswoman Kelsie Chiasson would not say where he and his family are in isolation or where they would get tests.  Ottawa’s few testing centres have been overwhelmed in the last few days, with hours-long lines forming before they open.  The Conservatives say the staffer who has the respiratory illness has been travelling with O’Toole.  O’Toole was to appear at a party event in Alberta Wednesday evening, part of a mini-tour of the Conservative heartland in the West.  And he was just in Quebec, where he met Premier Francois Legault on Monday.  Legault said in a tweet that after consulting with provincial health authorities, he won’t be seeking a COVID-19 test or self-isolating.  “Public health doesn’t recommend isolation or testing, only monitoring for the appearance of symptoms,” he wrote in French.  The federal parties are still sorting out how the House of Commons will function when it resumes next Wednesday. The Liberals favour a hybrid model, with some MPs in the chamber and others participating via videoconference with a mechanism for voting online.  The Conservatives have been arguing for MPs to participate in person only, with limits on the number of members in the chamber at a time and staggered voting when it’s needed.  Health Minister Patty Hajdu said the possibility of COVID-19 spreading among politicians bolsters the Liberals’ argument.  “I think it’s a very real concern because of course the nature of our work means that we come into contact with people that maybe are in contact with other people,” she said.  “We travel frequently for work. I live in a zone, for example, that has no active cases right now in Thunder Bay, Ont. But I will be returning there and so it presents risk to our communities as well when we travel.”  Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet is also in self-isolation, awaiting the results of his own COVID-19 test after both his spouse and an aide tested positive for the illness.  Blanchet’s aide’s positive test, a few days after the Bloc caucus met in person in St-Hyacinthe, Que., prompted dozens of MPs and party workers to isolate themselves.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau tested positive for COVID-19 early in the pandemic but recovered.  2:48 p.m.: The Niagara 2021 Canada Summer Games have been postponed until 2022 due to COVID-19.  The Canada Games Council (CGC) and host society announced the decision Wednesday after consultations with the Niagara Region, and the provincial and federal governments.  Originally scheduled for August of 2021 in the Niagara Region, the Games have been rescheduled to the summer of 2022.  More than 5,000 athletes and 4,000 volunteers are expected to participate in the country’s largest multi-sport event, the marquee competition for up-and-coming Canadian amateur athletes.  The Games are held every two years, alternating between summer and winter.  2:47 p.m.: Manulife Financial Corp. is offering COVID-19-related travel insurance for Canadians who take international and domestic trips, eliciting mixed reactions from the industry.  The policy, slated to roll out in October, will provide emergency medical coverage that includes the coronavirus and related conditions.  It will also provide some coverage linked to trip interruptions or cancellations in the event of quarantine, Manulife said in a release Wednesday.  The new “pandemic travel plan” includes visits to regions subject to a Level 3 travel advisory, which warns against non-essential travel and which Canada has issued for all countries.  The nation’s largest insurer follows some smaller providers in offering medical travel insurance that covers COVID-19, including the Canadian Association of Blue Cross in Ontario and Quebec. Trip interruptions are not covered under Blue Cross plans.  The Manulife plan includes emergency medical coverage up to $200,000 for COVID-19 and related conditions after a positive test result as well as emergency air transport to return home.  2:46 p.m.: As the weather gets cooler and COVID-19 cases start to surge again, more and more Canadians are looking to extend patio season by adding a heater to their outdoor space.  The demand for patio heaters has risen so much that retailers have been struggling to keep them in stock, according to the Retail Council Canada.  The council’s vice-president of public affairs, Kal Littler, said the products “have been flying off the shelves,” with demand coming from both commercial and residential customers.  2:44 p.m.: Some prospective jurors in three Ontario cities will be summoned to convention centres and other locations as the province resumes jury selection following a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Off-site locations will be used for jury selection in Toronto and nearby Brampton as of this week, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Attorney General said — among them the Metro Toronto and Pearson convention centres. Plans for an Ottawa location are also in the works.  The additional locations are meant to ensure that “health and safety measures — including physical distancing — can be properly implemented,” Maher Abdurahman said in an email.  At the Toronto convention centre, the ministry expects that up to 250 people could attend for jury selection, Abdurahman said.  2:42 p.m.: A single infusion of an experimental drug has markedly reduced levels of the coronavirus in newly infected patients and lowered the chances that they would need hospitalization, the drug’s maker announced Wednesday.  The drug is a monoclonal antibody, a manufactured copy of an antibody produced by a patient who recovered from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Many scientists hope monoclonal antibodies will prove to be powerful treatments for COVID-19, but they are difficult and expensive to manufacture, and progress has been slow.  The announcement, by Eli Lilly, was not accompanied by detailed data; independent scientists have not yet reviewed the results nor have they been published in a peer-reviewed journal.  2:39 p.m.: There are 139,141 confirmed cases in Canada.  Quebec: 65,554 confirmed (including 5,785 deaths, 57,628 resolved)  Ontario: 45,383 confirmed (including 2,822 deaths, 40,245 resolved)  Alberta: 15,957 confirmed (including 254 deaths, 14,212 resolved)  British Columbia: 7,376 confirmed (including 219 deaths, 5,548 resolved)  Saskatchewan: 1,741 confirmed (including 24 deaths, 1,616 resolved)  Manitoba: 1,489 confirmed (including 16 deaths, 1,190 resolved)  Nova Scotia: 1,086 confirmed (including 65 deaths, 1,020 resolved)  Newfoundland and Labrador: 271 confirmed (including 3 deaths, 266 resolved)  New Brunswick: 194 confirmed (including 2 deaths, 189 resolved)  Prince Edward Island: 57 confirmed (including 56 resolved)  Yukon: 15 confirmed (including 15 resolved)  Repatriated Canadians: 13 confirmed (including 13 resolved)  Northwest Territories: 5 confirmed (including 5 resolved)  Nunavut: No confirmed cases  Total: 139,141 (0 presumptive, 139,141 confirmed including 9,190 deaths, 122,003 resolved)  2:37 p.m.: Premier Doug Ford says Ontario will have the highest fines in the country for people who violate public health guidelines for social gatherings.  Ford says he will discuss the new measures aimed at lowering the number of people allowed at social gatherings with his cabinet later today.  The current limit on social gatherings is 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors.  The changes come as both Ford and health officials have said a spike in COVID-19 cases in recent days can be partly attributed to people breaking public health rules at social gatherings.  2 p.m. The Trump administration health official embroiled in a furor over political meddling with the coronavirus response is taking a leave of absence, the government announced Wednesday.  The Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that Michael Caputo was taking the time “to focus on his health and the well-being of his family.”  Caputo, the department’s top spokesman, apologized on Tuesday to his staff for a Facebook video in which he reportedly said scientists battling the coronavirus are conspiring against President Donald Trump and warned of shooting in America if Trump were to lose the November election.  The Trump appointee also was accused of trying to muzzle a scientific weekly put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  1:48 p.m. Premier Doug Ford says Ontario and the federal government will be working together in the coming months to achieve a surge testing capacity of 78,000 COVID-19 tests per day.  Ford makes the commitment in a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau outlining how Ontario plans to use its $7-billion portion of the $19-billion Safe Restart Agreement reached over the summer.  The premier says the surge testing will fulfil Ontario’s per capita share of the federal national testing commitment.  Ford also says in the letter that Ontario is committed to regularly administering 50,000 tests per day by the fall.  The letter says Ontario’s current testing levels are around 25,000 a day.  1:36 p.m. About 12 million people in South Africa have “probably” been infected with the coronavirus, but that startlingly high number has not caused a similarly high death rate and might indicate a widespread “level of immunity,” the country’s minister of health says.  More than 20 per cent of South Africa’s population of 58 million have had the virus at some point, Dr. Zweli Mkhize estimated earlier this week. He cited studies that found the presence of coronavirus antibodies in blood samples taken from parts of the population. The findings have prompted the government to start a more complete national study, Mkhize said.  “South Africa has seen the surge receding, and thus raises the question of the level of immunity that may already be existing in society,” he said.  Other studies have indicated that up to 40 per cent of the population might be immune to the virus, the health minister said. Some South African experts suggest that Africa’s most developed economy may be approaching herd immunity, but scientists believe at least 70-80 per cent of a population needs to be immune before there’s any effect. And with COVID-19 it’s unclear how long that immunity might last.  1:25 p.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released details Wednesday of how provinces and territories will spend the $19 billion the federal government is giving them to safely restart the economy.  The details are in letters each premier has sent outlining how they intend to spend the money.  Among other things, the funding will help increase testing and contact tracing, support the health care system, help municipalities deliver essential services like public transit and ensure a secure supply of personal protective equipment for frontline workers.  The money will also go towards increasing safe child-care spaces and income support for workers without paid sick leave.  Trudeau released the details just as he wrapped up two and a half days of cabinet meetings aimed at plotting a course through the COVID-19 health crisis.  Cases of COVID-19 have been on the rise across the country for the past several weeks.  Trudeau is to hold a news conference this afternoon at the conclusion of Wednesday’s cabinet meeting.  1:10 p.m. The Ontario government is launching a new COVID-19 screening tool for parents before their children go to school.  12:53 p.m. Federal Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole says he, his family and some party workers are in self-isolation after an aide tested positive for COVID-19.  A statement from the party says the O’Tooles are getting tested, informing the Opposition leader’s recent contacts and keeping his son home.  “My family and I are feeling well, but we take COVID-19 very seriously,” O’Toole said in the statement.  “Today was going to be Jack’s first day back at school, but instead we will be getting tested and self-isolating per public health guidelines. The health and safety of my family and all Canadians is my top priority.”  O’Toole was to appear at a party event in Alberta Wednesday evening, part of a mini-tour of the Conservative heartland in the West.  12:35 p.m. The top public health doctor in Kingston is urging local officials to take more drastic action to prevent students in the university town from partying during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Dr. Kieran Moore told a Tuesday-evening city council meeting that he believes the councillors should hike fines for those caught gathering in groups of more than 50 indoors or 100 outdoors in violation of public health orders.  The medical officer says students are still gathering in huge groups, in spite of the current $500 fine for “nuisance parties.”  He’s urging councillors to hike the penalty to $2,000 for first-time offenders, who would then be referred to the courts if they are caught again and would face a fine of up to $100,000.  Moore says Queen’s University should start expelling students who violate the order — something he says is permitted under the code of conduct.  He says administrators have been hesitant to take that action, so the school may need a “nudge” to “make the right decisions” when it comes to preventing the spread of COVID-19.  “This is already in the student handbook,” Moore said. “We’re not reinventing the wheel. We just want to see it utilized.”  10:35 a.m. (updated) Ontario hit another recent high in COVID-19 cases Wednesday as the province faced criticism from opposition parties for growing waits at testing centres and the lack of public hearings by a commission tasked to examine the pandemic’s heavy death toll in nursing homes.  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  The Ministry of Health said there were 315 new infections, the most in one day since early June, along with 12 new infections of students and staff, although none of the 35 schools with cases have been closed and overall hospitalizations remain low. It was the second day this week new cases topped 300.  Health Minister Christine Elliott said the increase is being driven by gatherings in homes, weddings and other private get-togethers, with Toronto, Peel and Ottawa continuing to be the hot spots. People under 40 accounted for two-thirds of the new cases.  Read the full story from the Star’s Rob Ferguson  10:24 a.m. Ontario will lower the limits on social gatherings in a bid to stem a recent increase in COVID-19 cases.  Premier Doug Ford’s office has confirmed the move but won’t say when the new health guidelines will be available.  The current limit on social gatherings is 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors.  Provincial health officials have attributed the spike in cases largely to people not following public health guidelines at social gatherings.  Ford has promised to take actions in the regions where most of the cases have emerged — Toronto, Peel, and Ottawa.  He has also not ruled out further lockdowns in those areas if virus case numbers aren’t brought under control.  10 a.m. An elementary and middle school in Winnipeg is switching some of its grades to remote learning after the discovery of more COVID-19 cases.  John Pritchard School has reported four new COVID-19 cases, in addition to one reported Sunday.  Students in Grades 6, 7 and 8, as well as a split Grade 4 and 5 class, will move entirely to remote learning for an estimated two weeks.  A spokesperson for the River East Transcona school division says public health investigations are ongoing, and all other students are continuing with in-class learning.  Manitoba students returned to class last week and schools were aiming to have full-time in-class learning for children up to Grade 8.  The province reported 17 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, for a total active case count of 269.  9:54 a.m. Canada’s main stock index edged higher in early trading, while U.S. stock markets also gained ground.  The S&P/TSX composite index was up 19.34 points at 16,450.61.  In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 34.24 points at 28,029.84. The S&P 500 index was up 7.72 points at 3,408.92, while the Nasdaq composite was up 32.54 points at 11,222.86.  The Canadian dollar traded for 75.87 cents US compared with 75.90 cents (U.S.) on Tuesday.  9:27 a.m. Statistics Canada says the consumer price index in August was up 0.1 per cent compared with a year ago.  The annual inflation rate was unchanged from the year-over-year increase of 0.1 per cent in July.  The average economist estimate had been for a year-over-year increase of 0.4 per cent for August, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.  Gasoline prices were down 11.1 per cent compared with August 2019, following a 14.9 per cent decline recorded in July.  Excluding gasoline from the inflation calculations, the consumer price index rose by 0.6 per cent in August.  Prices were up in other categories such as personal care services like haircuts, which had a year-over-year increase of 7.2 per cent.  The average of Canada’s three measures for core inflation, which are considered better gauges of underlying price pressures and closely tracked by the Bank of Canada, was 1.7 per cent.  The Bank of Canada intends to keep its key policy interest rate at 0.25 per cent, which is as low as it will go, until inflation is back at the central bank’s two per cent target.  The hope is that by keeping its rate low, the central bank can drive down rates on mortgages and loans to make it easier for people to borrow and spend to aid the economy as it recuperates from the COVID-19 crisis.  Experts suggest the Bank of Canada’s key rate could stay where it is until late 2022 or even into 2023, although the pace of a recovery is largely dependent on the path of the pandemic, which has affected large swaths of the Canadian economy.  9:06 a.m. The U.S. federal government outlined a sweeping plan Wednesday to make vaccines for COVID-19 available for free to all Americans, even as polls show a strong undercurrent of skepticism rippling across the land.  In a report to Congress and an accompanying “playbook” for states and localities, federal health agencies and the Defence Department sketched out complex plans for a vaccination campaign to begin gradually in January or possibly later this year, eventually ramping up to reach any American who wants a shot. The Pentagon is involved with the distribution of vaccines, but civilian health workers will be the ones giving shots.  The campaign is “much larger in scope and complexity than seasonal influenza or other previous outbreak-related vaccination responses,” said the playbook for states from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  8:45 a.m. Americans kept spending in August, but the pace of that growth is slowing as millions of people who lost jobs have now lost a $600 a week boost in their unemployment checks.  Retail sales rose 0.6 per cent last month, the fourth consecutive month of growth, the U.S. Commerce Department said Wednesday. In July, the number rose 0.9 per cent.  Retail sales have been recovering after they plunged in April and March as clothing stores and malls closed due to the spread of the coronavirus.  Some stores won’t make it out of the pandemic. Bargain chain Century 21 said last week it’s shutting down all of its 13 stores for good after nearly six decades in business. Lord & Taylor, which has been around for nearly 200 years, is also going out of business. Several others major retailers have sought bankruptcy protection, including J.C. Penney, Brooks Brothers and J.Crew.  Others retailers are thriving. Target and Walmart stayed open during the pandemic and became a lifeline for Americans stocking up on toilet paper and groceries. And Amazon’s sales soared as more people shopped online.  8:31 a.m. The British government plans to ration coronavirus testing, giving priority to health workers and care home staff after widespread reports that people around the country were unable to schedule tests.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday will face questions about his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the House of Commons and before a key committee amid the outcry over the shortage of testing.  Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the government is in the process of drawing up a new priority list for testing, suggesting that students and their families could be next in line after the National Health Service and social care.  “I think what we need to do is have a cascading system where we know where our priority should be, and for me priority should be for children in school and their parents in order to ensure their lives are safe and also importantly they are not disrupted in the way we are seeing,” Buckland told Sky News.  The squeeze on tests comes amid a surge in COVID-19 cases across the U.K. that has pushed daily new infections to levels not seen since late May and has forced the Conservative government to impose limits on public gatherings.  8:10 a.m. A McDonald’s restaurant in Richmond Hill has shut down after two of its employees are reported to have COVID-19.  The restaurant located at 420 Highway 7, east of Valleymeade Drive has been closed for “thorough cleaning and sanitization” conducted by a third party. Employees who have been in close contact with those presumed to be infected have been asked to self quarantine until further notice.  Customers who visited the location between Sept. 9 and 11 are encouraged to follow public health protocols, and monitor for any symptoms.  6:31 a.m.: Statistics Canada will reveal today how the country’s official measure of inflation fared in August, with expectations for another month of near-zero readings.  In July, the annual pace of inflation stayed largely grounded at 0.1 per cent as gasoline prices stayed low and air travel prices tumbled for the first time in five years.  August isn’t expected to be much different with the average economist estimate predicting a year-over-year increase in the consumer price index of 0.4 per cent, according to financial data firm Refinitiv.  The Bank of Canada intends to keep its key policy interest rate at 0.25 per cent, which is as low as it will go, until inflation is back at the central bank’s two per cent target.  5:45 a.m.: Fielding compelling questions about voters’ real-world problems, President Donald Trump denied during a televised town hall that he had played down the threat of the coronavirus earlier this year, although there is an audio recording of him stating he did just that.  Trump, in what could well be a preview of his performance in the presidential debates less than two weeks away, cast doubt on the widely accepted scientific conclusions of his own administration strongly urging the use of face coverings and seemed to bat away the suggestion that the nation has racial inequities.  “Well, I hope there’s not a race problem,” Trump said Tuesday when asked about his campaign rhetoric seeming to ignore the historical injustices carried out against Black Americans.  Face-to-face with everyday voters for the first time in months, Trump was defensive but resisted agitation as he was pressed on his administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and why he doesn’t more aggressively promote the use of masks to reduce the spread of the disease.  “There are people that don’t think masks are good,” Trump said, though his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly urges their use.  Trump sought to counter his admission to journalist Bob Woodward that he was deliberately “playing it down” when discussing the threat of COVID-19 to Americans earlier this year. Despite audio of his comments being released, Trump said: “Yeah, well, I didn’t downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it, in terms of action.”  “My action was very strong,” Trump added. “I’m not looking to be dishonest. I don’t want people to panic.”  5:37 a.m.: The new president of the U.N. General Assembly is warning that unilateralism will only strengthen the COVID-19 pandemic and is calling for a new commitment to global co-operation including on the fair and equitable distribution of vaccines.  Turkish diplomat and politician Volkan Bozkir, who took over the reins of the 193-member world body on Tuesday, announced that the General Assembly will hold a high-level special session on the COVID-19 pandemic in early November, though diplomats said the date may slip.  Bozkir takes over from outgoing General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, who presided over a unique year-old session that he said was “defined by a pandemic” and included virtual meetings and new voting procedures.  5:28 a.m.: The British government plans to ration coronavirus testing, giving priority to health workers and care home staff after widespread reports that people throughout the country were unable to schedule tests.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday will face questions about his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the House of Commons and before a key committee amid the outcry over the shortage of testing.  Justice Secretary Robert Buckland says the government is in the process of drawing up a new priority list for testing, suggesting that students and their families could be next in line after the National Health Service and social care.  5:18 a.m.: The Spanish capital will introduce selective lockdowns in urban areas where the coronavirus is spreading faster.  Deputy regional health chief Antonio Zapatero said Wednesday that the measures will most likely affect southern, working-class neighbourhoods of Madrid where infection rates have been steadily soaring since August.  Zapatero said that Madrid wants to “flatten the curve before the arrival of autumn and the complications that cold weather could bring,” adding that the measures to be taken will be decided by this weekend.  Madrid and its surrounding region of 6.6 million people have accounted for nearly one third of Spain’s new cases, which have averaged 8,200 per day for the past week.  5:15 a.m.: South Korea’s daily coronavirus tally has stayed below 200 for two weeks, but the government is urging people not to lower their guard. Authorities said Wednesday that the 113 cases added in the last 24 hours took the country’s total to 22,504, including 367 deaths. Eighty-one of them were in the Seoul metropolitan area, the heart of a recent viral resurgence in South Korea.  5:11 a.m.: Vietnam will resume international commercial flights connecting the country to several Asian destinations starting Friday, after a months-long shutdown to curb the coronavirus outbreak.  According to a report posted on the government website, flights connecting Vietnam’s two largest cities — Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City — to destinations in South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan will operate on a weekly basis. Flights connecting the cities with Cambodia and Laos will resume next week.  The flights, however, are reserved for Vietnamese nationals, diplomats, experts, managers, skilled workers, investors and their families. They are not yet available for tourists.  To board a flight, passengers must hold a certificate showing they have tested negative for the coronavirus no more than five days before the departure date. Upon arrival, they will be tested and placed under quarantine, the report said.  4:05 a.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is to wrap up two and a half days of cabinet meetings today aimed at plotting a course through the COVID-19 health crisis.  Bold talk of an audacious plan to rebuild the shattered economy gave way during the meetings to the more immediate challenge of confronting the potential for a second deadly wave of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  Cases of COVID-19 have been on the rise across the country for the past several weeks.  Consequently, ministers have been focused almost exclusively on how to protect the health of Canadians and avert the potential for another economy-ravaging, nation-wide shutdown like the one that threw millions of Canadians out of work last spring.  The pandemic has already upended the government’s plans to deliver on platform commitments upon which the Liberals won re-election just last fall, when the climate change crisis was at the top of their agenda.  4 a.m.: Some prospective jurors will be summoned to a downtown Toronto convention centre as the province resumes jury selection following a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In a notice issued Tuesday to those in the legal field, the Ministry of the Attorney General says the Metro Toronto Convention Centre is “prepared to host jury events” on its targeted date of Sept. 16.  The ministry says the centre will be used as a backup location for the Superior Court of Justice and the Civil Superior Court of Justice.  The Ontario Superior Court temporarily halted in-person operations in mid-March due to concerns over the novel coronavirus, with all criminal and civil matters suspended or adjourned until June.  Dozens of courthouses reopened in July, with more doing so this week.  12 a.m.: The Australian PGA tournament has been postponed to February because of uncertainties over coronavirus-enforced restrictions.  The PGA of Australia on Wednesday said the European Tour co-sanctioned golf tournament, scheduled for early December at Royal Queensland in Brisbane, is now tentatively scheduled for Feb. 18-21, but the status of the event will be reviewed again in December.  It follows the postponement of November’s Australian Open at Melbourne’s Kingston Heath to sometime next year. Victoria state is experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 infections and deaths, and the city of Melbourne is in lockdown with nightly curfews.  Tuesday 11:57 p.m.: India’ coronavirus confirmed cases crossed 5 million on Wednesday, still soaring and testing the country’s feeble health care system in tens of thousands of impoverished towns and villages.  The Health Ministry reported 90,123 new cases in the past 24 hours, raising the nation’s confirmed total to 5,020,359, about 0.35% of its nearly 1.4 billion population. It said 1,290 more people died in the past 24 hours, for a total of 82,066.  India’s total coronavirus caseload is closing in on the United States’ highest tally of more than 6.6 million cases and expected to surpass it within weeks.

Gov. David Ige said Wednesday that travelers will have to take the test within 72 hours before their flight arrives in the islands. Ige says drug store operator CVS and healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente will conduct the tests.  The state has previously delayed the start of the pre-travel testing program twice as COVID-19 cases spiked on the U.S. mainland and in Hawaii.  Leaders hope pre-travel testing will encourage tourists to return while keeping residents safe. Tourism traffic to the state has plunged more than 90% during the pandemic, closing hundreds of hotels and putting many people out of work.  ———  HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK  — CDC director: Scientific integrity unchanged despite White House pressure  — Eli Lilly says antibody study gives hint of help for COVID-19 patients  — UK to ration COVID-19 testing amid testing failures  — The U.S. government released a sweeping plan to make vaccines for the coronavirus available for free to all Americans, assuming a safe and effective shot is developed.  — South Africa’s minister of health says about 12 million people have “probably” been infected with the coronavirus.

That is almost double the official death toll of 11,318 reported for the pandemic in Mexico City.  The head of the city’s Digital Innovation Agency says there were 30,462 “excess deaths” in the city between April 1 and the end of August, about two-thirds of which were determined to be due to coronavirus. David Merino wrote in his Twitter account that 92% of those deaths were in hospitals and 7% at private residences.  Like all of Mexico, the city of almost 9 million inhabitants has had an extremely low testing rate and officials acknowledge that the number of test-confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths probably undercounts the real figures.  ———  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is disagreeing with the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the potential availability of a coronavirus vaccine to the general public.  Trump promised Wednesday that a vaccine will be available much sooner than was projected in congressional testimony earlier in the day by Dr. Robert Redfield.  Trump says Redfield “made a mistake” when he told lawmakers that any vaccine available in November or December would be in “very limited supply,” and reserved for first responders and people most vulnerable to COVID-19. Redfield estimated the shot wouldn’t be broadly available until the spring or summer of 2021.  Trump is predicting a vaccine will be approved before voters go to the polls Nov. 3.  ———  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he disagrees with the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention telling lawmakers that wearing a mask is guaranteed to protect people more from the novel coronavirus than a vaccine.  Trump said at a White House news conference that a mask is “not more effective by any means than a vaccine, and I called him about that.”  Trump’s comments were the second time he questioned the testimony of the CDC’s Robert Redfield on Wednesday. Earlier, he said Redfield was wrong in his estimation of how fast a potential vaccine will be available to the general public.  Trump says that “I hope the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the mask.” He also says that “the mask perhaps helps.”  Trump says he still has confidence in Redfield.  ———  HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pennsylvania’s top lawyer is asking a federal judge to keep in place Gov. Tom Wolf’s limits on crowd size, arguing that allowing large groups to congregate “will result in people’s deaths” from the coronavirus.  The office of Attorney General Josh Shapiro urged U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV on Wednesday to delay enforcement of his ruling that many of the governor’s pandemic shutdown orders are unconstitutional.  Stickman has said the state’s size limits for indoor and outdoor gatherings violate citizens’ constitutional right to assemble. The state has been enforcing a gathering limit of 25 people for indoor events and 250 for those held outside.  Shapiro’s office says Stickman’s ruling “does not consider the manner in which COVID-19 is spread or the rationale for adopting the congregate limits.” Its points out that other federal judges and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court have upheld Wolf’s pandemic shutdown orders.  ———  COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio has enacted a law that bars local or state officials from closing churches or other houses of worship and that bans the changing of election dates.  The legislation signed Wednesday by Gov. Mike DeWine was pushed through by Republican lawmakers in reaction to such orders as part of coronavirus containment measures. DeWine had refrained from shutting down religious institutions during the pandemic, but some other governors have restricted religious gatherings.  The new law also takes aim at DeWine’s eleventh hour decision in March to postpone the state’s in-person primary because of concerns about the coronavirus. The statute forbids moving elections other than from the “time, place and manner” spelled out in state law.  ———  ANNAPOLIS, Md. — It will likely be at least six to eight months longer before a coronavirus vaccine can be distributed in a best-case scenario, leading Maryland health officials and lawmakers said as they make plans for the state.  Senate President Bill Ferguson said he spoke on Tuesday with one of the principal investigators at Johns Hopkins University who is working on a vaccine now in its third phase. While there has been remarkable progress, Ferguson said Wednesday that the logistics that go into distributing a vaccine are “enormous and herculean.”  “I think it’s really important that we keep that in mind moving forward as we make decisions about the future of Maryland — that even with an amazing light-speed approval, it is still six to eight months from that point until we’ll start to see the impact on herd immunity overall, so there is time to go in this ballgame,” Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said during a meeting of a legislative panel on the coronavirus.  Robert Neall, Maryland’s health secretary, emphasized that people need to be prepared to use available tools like masks and handwashing well into next year.  ———  BERLIN — Germany has declared three European capitals and several regions “risk areas” for coronavirus.  The Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the Austrian capital Vienna, Budapest in Hungary and the Dutch region that includes Amsterdam were added to the risk list due to high numbers of COVID-19 infections there.  Also listed were several regions in France, Romania, Croatia, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.  Travelers arriving in Germany from those locations have to go into mandatory quarantine and take a coronavirus test.  ———  ISTANBUL — Turkey’s health minister says Phase 3 trials for China’s Sinovac Biotech’s two-step vaccine have begun in Turkey with three Turkish health workers.  Fahrettin Koca said Wednesday the trial would expand to 1,200 volunteers and then to 10,000. He said trials for a Pfizer vaccine were also beginning and others were pending, adding that he hoped widespread vaccinations would start towards the end of 2020.  ———  UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations chief says the COVID-19 pandemic remains “out of control,” with the world approaching “the grimmest of milestones: 1 million lives lost to the virus.”  Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a news conference Wednesday that the coronavirus “is the number one global security threat in our world today,” posing a crisis that is “unlike any in our lifetimes.”  He said that’s why he called for a global cease-fire on March 23 to tackle the pandemic.  And in his speech to world leaders at next Tuesday’s mainly virtual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, Guterres said he will make “a strong appeal to the international community to mobilize all efforts for the global cease-fire to become a reality by the end of the year.”  The secretary-general urged the international community to come together to defeat the virus, stressing that a vaccine alone can’t solve the crisis.  ———  JOHANNESBURG — South Africa’s president says the country will reopen for international travel as of Oct. 1 after confirmed coronavirus cases have dropped dramatically in recent weeks.  President Cyril Ramaphosa says visitors may not be allowed from countries deemed at high risk and a list of countries will be published in the coming days.  Visitors will be required to show negative test results for the virus no older than 72 hours before departure. Those who didn’t test before departure will be required to stay in quarantine at their own cost.  International flights will be allowed only at the country’s three main airports in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.  ———  WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Wednesday was asked whether the White House was now counting on herd immunity to deal with the virus.  President Donald Trump said during an ABC News town hall on Tuesday that eventually there will be herd immunity to the virus, but that with a vaccine, the virus will go away “very quickly.”  For the United States to reach herd immunity against the coronavirus, most experts say, the nation would likely need to vaccinate roughly 70% of Americans.  “Herd immunity has never been a strategy here at the White House,” McEnany said. “The president last night was noting ... (that) over a period of time a country, a society, can reach herd immunity. It’s a fact. It was not a strategy ever presented here at the White House.""  ———  LONDON — The U.K. has recorded nearly 4,000 new coronavirus cases for the first time since May amid mounting concerns the country is on the verge of a second wave.  Government figures show new cases rising to 3,991, up markedly from Tuesday’s figure of 3,105. Though more testing is picking up more cases, it’s clear the virus is spreading. The latest daily increase is more than two times the level reported a few weeks back.  Officials recently banned social gatherings in England of more than six people both indoors and outdoors. Though many of the recent cases involve younger people, there are concerns more vulnerable people may become infected.  The government reported Wednesday another 20 people died within 28 days after testing positive for COVID-19, the new U.K. cutoff for official deaths instituted in the last few weeks.  That takes the death toll to 41,684, Europe’s highest and fifth highest in the world. On Aug. 20, the reported death toll in the U.K. was 41,483.  ———  BUDAPEST, Hungary — Hungary’s prime minister set a maximum price for coronavirus tests, extended mandatory use of face masks and ordered temperature checks at school for all students and teachers starting Oct. 1.  Viktor Orban says in a video posted on Facebook that tests cannot cost more than 19,500 forints ($64.50). Wearing masks, already obligatory on public transportation and stores, will be extended to theaters, cinemas, health care and social institutions, among others, and nightclubs must close at 11 p.m.  Orban says the health care system was prepared to deal with the second wave of the pandemic, with a plan to increase the availability of hospital beds and deploy doctors and nurses where needed.  ———  BERLIN — German public broadcaster ARD reports a far-right lawmaker in the national Parliament has tested positive for the coronavirus.  ARD quoted the Alternative for Germany party confirming Wednesday that Norbert Kleinwaechter was tested positive for COVID-19 and informed his caucus Tuesday. Six other lawmakers for the party and several parliamentary staff he’d been in contact with were sent home to isolate.  Some Alternative for Germany lawmakers took part in protests against pandemic restrictions in recent months.  Germany’s disease control center says the country recorded 1,901 new infections in the past day, taking the total to nearly 264,000. Germany has confirmed 9,368 COVID-related deaths since the start of the outbreak."

Many governments view the activity as an unfair competitive practice and frequently expose those engaged in dumping to an anti-dumping duty. Dumping duty is an additional import duty imposed to offset the effect of dumping which is found to materially injure the domestic industry.  It is well-known that a large number of low-priced shoddy and spurious products from China are flooding Indian markets. Indo-China trade was resumed in 1978 after it remained suspended in the wake of Chinese aggression in 1962. With China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001, bilateral trade between the two countries received further impetus.  The deluge of imports from China has adversely affected India’s manufacturing sector, particularly micro and small industries. Dumping by China has forced many industrial units to operate at below capacity levels and in some cases to shut down. This has negatively affected local employment. Though the quality of Chinese products is often questionable, their availability at a low price has created a large market for them.  Why are Chinese goods more price-competitive than similar Indian goods? Chinese competitiveness is mainly the result of efforts and support of the Chinese government. A large number of companies which dominate exports are government-controlled enterprises. China is not recognized by WTO as a market economy mainly because of the lack of transparency in its trade policy.  While China has been long accused of manipulating its currency to maintain export competitiveness, it has also been found guilty of unfair trade practices like export subsidies which are in contravention to WTO regulations. The Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce (Chairman: Naresh Gujral) which presented its report to the Indian Parliament on July 26, 2018 was informed by revenue authorities that Chinese government gives rebates to the tune of 17 percent to exporters.  Further, regional provinces in China extend tax incentives and rebates and compete with each other to attract industries in their region. They also promote exports by extending sizeable incentives such as logistics compensation for long distance freight, which makes Chinese products cost-effective.  Apart from above WTO non-compliant trade practices, Chinese competitiveness is also the result of an enabling policy environment, often opaque, wherein the government ensures that factors of production (land, labour, capital) are available to the manufacturers at the cheapest costs. Lending rates in China are industry-friendly (6 percent or even lower); while in India banks charge one of the highest lending rates from industry, anywhere between 11 and 14 percent.  Chinese manufacturers produce different qualities of a product for different markets including poor quality cheap goods for low-income countries. These low-quality products have a negative impact on the environment. For instance, import of impure chemicals results in low quality agro-chemicals (pesticides) for farmers. Similarly, poor quality toys, colours, firecrackers, rakhis, diyas, statues of gods and goddesses from China are health hazards for Indian families, particularly children.  The methods adopted for dumping cheap goods in the Indian market include under-invoicing of goods, entry of prohibited goods by mis-declaration, re-routing goods through other countries and smuggling, both at sea and on land. As recently reported (HT July 13), measuring tapes and their components of Chinese origin were being exported to India through Singapore and Cambodia. The government, therefore, imposed anti-dumping duties, effective July 8, 2020, on these products originating from China or any other country for a period of 5 years.  India can ill afford to be a dumping ground for Chinese products which cause harm to local manufacturing and lead to increase in trade deficit. In fact, there is widespread global outrage against China’s illegal and dubious trade practices. While US and EU have been quite aggressive in addressing these concerns, India has been less proactive in adopting trade defence measures provided under WTO.  The dumping of Chinese goods has negatively impacted domestic industries, some of which are labour-intensive and have traditionally been large employment generators, e.g. textiles. The Committee referred to above made the shocking revelation that dumping of Chinese solar panels led to a loss of nearly 2 lakh jobs as nearly half of the domestic industry capacity remained idle. It also revealed that as on April 18, 2018, definitive anti-dumping duty was in force on 144 products out of which 102 products were Chinese.  Downsizing or closing down of units has affected tax collections and impinged upon the Make in India programme. Further, the closure of units has stressed the banking sector which is already reeling under the burden of huge non-performing assets (NPAs).  Post-Covid-19, the global economy is unpredictable and volatile and every country has to manage under uncertainty. Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Initiative) announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 12, 2020 is a timely call, given the prevailing global environment. Moreover, the recent incidents on the Indo-China frontier have angered the nation which is now keen to impose economic costs on the adversary. The most effective way to do this is to boycott Chinese goods, which, in most cases, are harmful to health and environment. In short, it is time to dump China.  M.M. Sury is a guest contributor.

The flights, however, are reserved for Vietnamese nationals, diplomats, experts, managers, skilled workers, investors and their families. They are not yet available for tourists.  According to a report on the government website, flights connecting Vietnam’s two largest cities — Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City — to destinations in South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan will operate on a weekly basis. Flights connecting the cities with Cambodia and Laos will resume next week.  To board a flight, passengers must hold a certificate showing they have tested negative for the coronavirus no more than five days before the departure date.

National carrier Vietnam Airlines estimated last month that it would lose $650 million in 2020.  Vietnam has reported 1,059 cases of the coronavirus. It managed to avoid any deaths until July, when the virus crept into the city of Da Nang, killing 35 people.  But no new cases have been reported for two weeks. Last week, Da Nang lifted a travel restriction after two months.

Clinical trials of several vaccine candidates had been progressing smoothly and preparations were being made to go into mass production, Wu Guizhen, the CDC's chief biosafety expert, said in a programme shown on Monday night by state broadcaster CCTV.  ""I joined the experimental group and had a coronavirus shot in April,"" Wu said. ""I've felt quite good in the past few months, nothing abnormal. The process of inoculation did not cause any localised pain.""  The news that a vaccine might be available in China in as little as two months' time came after the WHO on Monday warned of a possible resurgence in infections in October and November. Photo / 123RF  According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), more than 30 vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical trials around the world. Of the nine to have reached the final, phase three, stage, five were developed in China.  Wu said she was optimistic about the vaccine candidates' efficacy and safety.  ""We expect them to remain effective for one to three years … [but] the results will need to be observed for a longer time.""  On the subject of mass production, Wu said experts had been assessing the capabilities of various facilities.  ""Two [plants] have won approval and the appraisal of a third is under way,"" she said.  In a CCTV interview broadcast last month, Zheng Zhongwei, director of the National Health Commission's science and technology development centre, said China had been administering a locally produced Covid-19 vaccine candidate to selected groups of workers, including medical staff and border inspection officials, since July.  He said the inoculation programme would be rolled out to include people who worked in the transport and service industries and at wet markets, with the aim of creating an ""immunity barrier"".  None of those who had received an initial dose reported a fever and only a few had any adverse reactions, he said.  The news that a vaccine might be available in China in as little as two months' time came after the WHO on Monday warned of a possible resurgence in infections in October and November, after almost 308,000 new cases were reported around the world on Sunday, the highest daily total ever recorded.  ""Cooperation is very important to contain the pandemic globally,"" Wu said.  Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged at a WHO meeting in May that any Covid-19 vaccines developed by China would be a ""global public good"" and made available to all nations.  Beijing has offered to provide a US$1 billion loan to Latin American and Caribbean countries to help them pay for vaccines, and said Mekong River countries – Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam – and African nations would be among the first to benefit.  Despite Beijing's confidence in its products, the United States' top infectious diseases official Anthony Fauci said it was unlikely America would use vaccines developed by either China or Russia, as their regulatory systems were far more opaque than those in the West.  - South China Morning Post  ‌"

In the recent decade, the most dominant EV-A71 genotypes in Taiwan were B5 and C4 but changed to C1 in 2018. Antibody-mediated immunity plays a key role in limiting the EV-A71 illness in humans. However, the level of neutralizing activities against genotype C1 virus by human polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) remains largely unclear. In the study, we demonstrated that that 39% (9 in 23) of post-infection sera from the genotype B5- or C4-infected patients in 2014–2017 exhibit reduced titers with the 2018–2019 genotype C1 viruses than with the earlier B5 and C4 viruses tested. This finding with polyclonal sera is confirmed with human MAbs derived from genotype B5 virus-infected individuals. The 2018–2019 genotype C1 virus is resistant to the majority of canyon-targeting human MAbs, which may be associated with the residue change near or at the bottom of the canyon region on the viral capsid. The remaining three antibodies (16-2-11B, 16-3-4D, and 17-1-12A), which target VP1 S241 on the 5-fold vertex, VP3 E81 on the 3-fold plateau and VP2 D84 on the 2-fold plateau of genotype C1 viral capsid, respectively, retained neutralizing activities with variable potencies. These neutralizing antibodies were also found to be protective against a lethal challenge of the 2018–2019 genotype C1 virus in an hSCARB2-transgenic mice model. These results indicate that the EV-A71-specific antibody response may consist of a fraction of poorly neutralizing antibodies against 2018–2019 genotype C1 viruses among a subset of previously infected individuals. Epitope mapping of protective antibodies that recognize the emerging genotype C1 virus has implications for anti-EV-A71 MAbs and the vaccine field.  Author summary EV-A71 is a cause of hand-foot-mouth disease, epidemics of which still regularly occur around the globe. Given that EV-A71 immune protection from the disease correlates with neutralizing antibody responses, but the responses in humans prior to an outbreak are still poorly understood. An outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease among children emerged in Taiwan from 2018 to 2019, and genotype C1 EV-A71 caused most of the cases. Here, we characterized EV-A71-neutralizing antibody profiles in details at both the serological and monoclonal levels and showed that antibodies generated by humans prior to the emergence of genotype C1 EV-A71 less effectively neutralize C1 compared to the prior circulating genotypes, which implies the presence of antigenic variation in the EV-A71 genotypes. We further identified and mapped critical neutralizing epitopes of 2018–2019 genotype C1 EV-A71 on the top and margin of the viral capsid pentamer and demonstrated the in vivo protective effect of human monoclonal antibodies, which highlight the properties of human antibody-neutralizing sites on EV-A71 and the potential of human antibodies as antiviral agents.

Introduction Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is a major cause of hand-foot-mouth disease in children and is associated with severe neurological complications, including brain stem encephalitis and myelitis [1]. This virus is divided into seven distinct genogroups (A-G), of which two major genogroups, B and C, are further divided into B1-B5 and C1-C6 genotypes, respectively [2, 3]. Predominance of specific genotype is found in most outbreaks, but co-circulation of multiple genotypes can occur [4]. Genotypes B4, B5, and C4 viruses are mainly detected in the Asia-Pacific region, whereas genotypes C1 and C2 are prevalent in Europe [5, 6]. The genotype C1 EV-A71 emerged in Germany in 2015 and caused local outbreaks with severe neurological diseases in France, Poland, and Spain in recent years [7–14]. In Taiwan, previously circulating EV-A71 belonged to genotype C2 in 1998, B4 in 2000–2001, C4 in 2004–2005, B5 in 2008 and 2012, and C1 detected only rarely in 2009 [6]. An island-wide outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease caused by EV-A71 affected Taiwanese children from 2018 to early 2019 and was associated with severe neurological disease (S1 Fig). Preexisting neutralizing antibodies are critical for protection against severe complications and mortality caused by acute EV-A71 infection in humans [15–17]. Epidemiologic data has shown that the age-specific seropositive rate quickly rises from infancy (8%, 0.5–0.9 years) to preschool children (42%, 3–5.9 years) and reaches a plateau of approximately 60% among older children aged 6–11 years and above [15]. This indicates that young children are at greatest risk for novel EV-A71 infections. Preexisting antibody-mediated immunity to a certain extent may play a significant role in determining the prevalence of the virus. The importance of preexisting antibodies is further supported by protection from the acquisition of maternal antibodies against severe outcomes of acute EV-A71 infection in early infancy. The rate of symptomatic EV-A71 infection is lowest in seropositive infants who are younger than 6 months, and mortality and case fatality rates in this age group are also lower than those observed for children who were 0.5 to 1 year of age during the epidemic [15]. The capsid protein of EV-A71 is the major target when producing antibodies against viruses for immune system recognition and plays a key role in antigenicity [18–20]. An antigenic map was constructed based on serological data and showed antigenic diversity of different genotypes of EV-A71. The antigenic map showed that genotype B1 and B4 viruses are clustered closely together, genotype C2 and C4 form a separate cluster distinct from genotype B, and genotype B5 forms its own cluster [21]. This suggests a difference in antigenic properties and antigenic diversity among various genotypes of EV-A71 [21]. The epidemiological survey also supports that the emergence of new EV-A71 variants exhibiting altered antigenicity may result in increased circulation and altered clinical manifestations [14]. Here, we detected genotype C1 EV-A71 in children with hand-foot-mouth disease and severe neurological cases from 2018 to early 2019 during an EV-A71 outbreak in Taiwan. The virus is clustered to other genotype C1 viruses circulated in other endemic regions in the late 2010s. With the 2018–2019 genotype C1 viruses, we noted that a portion of post-infection sera collected from previously infected individuals in 2014–2017 had substantially reduced neutralizing titers. The majority of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that fail to react with the 2018–2019 genotype C1 viruses targets the epitope at the bottom of the capsid canyon region, where residue changes occurred in the 2018–2019 virus. A few antibodies that target the plateau and the 5-fold vertex epitopes retained neutralizing activities with the 2018–2019 virus and were protective in vivo. The neutralization epitopes of the genotype C1 EV-A71 capsid were identified with human antibodies, indicating that these epitopes are possible targets of antibody response upon natural infection and vaccination.  Discussion The genotype C1 EV-A71 emerged and became the leading cause of hand-foot-mouth disease and severe neurological complications in Taiwan from 2018 to early 2019. The emergence or re-emergence of an EV-A71 outbreak among young children could be a consequence of the accumulation of susceptible individuals who are not protected by immune memory or are still naïve to the virus. The seropositivity rate varied greatly among different endemic regions and reflected the disease burden in the local area [29, 30]. Young children who are seronegative to EV-A71 have a high risk of developing acute illness and spreading the virus during an outbreak. On the other hand, those who were previously infected would have acquired a certain level of humoral memory but may have impaired protection against newly emerging variants. The genetic evolution of EV-A71 is likely driven by selective pressure exerted by humoral immune response. Recent studies have also reported that inter-genotype shifts are common in Taiwan and Japan between EV-A71 outbreaks [31]. Cross-neutralization by anti-EV-A71 antibodies was observed among genotypes using animal and human antisera [32, 33]. However, children infected with genotype B had higher neutralization titers against genogroup B than genogroup C [34]. A previous vaccine trial also showed that the genotype B4 EV-A71 vaccine fails to elicit a protective neutralization titer against genotype C2 [35]. Such evidence clearly suggests the existence of antigenic variation among EV-A71 genotypes, although the underlying mechanism determining viral emergence and the scale and severity of hand-foot-mouth disease outbreak may be a complex interplay between cross-immunity, pathogen evolution, and herd immunity. An alternative possibility for the EV-A71 outbreak is that the recombination event may contribute to the acquisition of distinct antigenicity or pathogenicity for a newly emerging variant. A recent example is the emerging genotype C1 EV-A71 associated neurologic complications in several outbreaks in Europe [3, 8, 12]. This new EV-A71 strain has a genotype C1-like VP1 region but has genetic recombination patterns with B3/C2-like and C4 viruses in the 5´ untranslated and the P2/P3 regions, respectively. It is suggested that this new EV-A71 strain may have been generated by recombination of the locally circulating C1 strain with the imported C4 strain that recently became dominant [23, 36]. Human sera and MAb derived from infected individuals were used to characterize the antigenic phenotype of the 2018–2019 genotype C1 EV-A71. We found that canyon-targeting antibodies, especially those that bind to the bottom of the canyon, lost neutralizing activity against the 2018–2019 genotype C1 EV-A71. The canyon region is believed to be poorly immunogenic to evoke a picornavirus-reactive antibody response because of its relatively inaccessible structure on the viral surface. The exemption from antibody-mediated attack would permit the conservation of canyon residues, which ideally offers the virus a functional fitness for binding to the host cell receptor [37, 38]. Sequence alignment showed that the canyon epitope is highly conserved among circulating EV-A71 strains except for one surface residue adjacent to the epitope, VP3 residue 232, mutates (threonine or alanine-to-serine substitutions) in 2018–2019 genotype C1 viruses. Previously, we have showed that single amino acid substitution in the epitope would allow for the escape of EV-A71 from neutralization by human antibodies [24]. Moreover, the differences in length and properties of the side chain may influence the steric hindrance between neighboring residues and lead to the changes in overall tertiary structure of the epitope region. Critical neutralization determinants of genotype C1 EV-A71 were mapped on the 5-fold vertex and plateau region of the viral capsid. All three residues (VP1 Ser 241, VP3 Glu 81, VP2 Asp 84) are conserved in circulating EV-A71 strains. The VP1 residue 241 is adjacent to the receptor binding site and is proposed to engage with cellular receptor P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and heparan sulfate [25]. Chang et al demonstrated that amino acid substitutions of VP1 residues 145, 146, and 241 on the 5-fold vertex affect the binding of EV-A71 to the cellular receptor and subsequently viral entry into the cell [39], indicating the role of the 5-fold vertex in the initiation of viral infection. VP3 residue 81 and VP2 residue 84 are part of the 3-fold and 2-fold plateau epitopes recognized by human neutralizing antibodies, respectively. VP3 residue 81 was also found within the footprints of two murine-derived neutralizing antibodies, D6 and A9 [19], both of which are potent neutralizer that prevent the virus from attaching. Thus, VP3 residue 81 appears to be immunogenic to elicit a neutralizing antibody response in both humans and animals. VP2 residue 84 is near the VP2 GH loop in the 3D structure, where several residues (e.g., VP2 Lys 149) are involved in viral attachment with cellular hSCARB2 [40]. Taken together, antibody epitopes on the genotype C1 EV-A71 capsid may overlap or are in close proximity to key residues that mediate the attachment of the virus to host cell receptors. Following the eradication of polio in developed countries, EV-A71 has become one of the major enteroviruses that tend to cause severe neurological complications and mortality. Currently, there is no available antiviral agent and no licensed vaccine in most areas with endemic EV-A71. Supportive care is the mainstay of clinical management for symptomatic infections. There is an urgent need for the development and clinical application of novel agents for the prevention and treatment of acute EV-A71 infection. Lim et al showed that passive transfer of neutralizing MAbs against EV-A71 surface proteins prevents the development of severe illness in challenged mice [41]. Adoptive transfer of neutralizing antibodies has also been found to contribute to reductions in mortality rate and tissue viral load in B-cell deficiency mice [42]. In humans, clinical observations of passive therapy in immunocompromised patients support the role of neutralizing antibodies in treating severe enteroviral infections [43, 44]. Here, we provided in vivo evidence that human neutralizing MAbs to the EV-A71 capsid protect against a lethal virus challenge in a susceptible mouse model, indicating the potential prophylactic value of potent and broadly reactive human MAbs in clinical settings.  Methods Ethical approval The study protocol and informed consent were approved by the ethics committee at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Each subject provided written informed consent. The study and all associated methods were carried out in accordance with the approved protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Samples Hospitalized children with hand-foot-mouth disease or herpangina were randomly enrolled at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in 2018–2019. The laboratory diagnosis for acute EV-A71 infection was based on positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [45] and/or positive EV-A71-specific IgM rapid test (Formosa One Sure EV71 IgM Rapid Test kit, Formosa Biomedical Technology, Taiwan) [45] and/or isolation of virus from throat or rectal swabs. Sera were collected and stored in -80°C before test. Viruses EV-A71 clinical strains, including TW-96015-2012, TW-50555-2016, TW-209-2018, TW-5011-2018, TW-7002-2018, TW-901-2019, TW-3018-2019 and TW-225-2019, were used in the experiments. All viruses were plaque purified and amplified in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. All of the throat and/or rectal swab specimens were submitted to isolate enterovirus and rhabdomyosarcoma cells were used for virus isolation and propagation. Those positive for enteroviruses were examined by type-specific monoclonal antibodies against EV-A71 for serotype identification in the immunofluorescent assay [46]. Viral RNA was extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and the VP1, VP2 and VP3 regions were amplified with a set of primers (S4 Table). The analysis of VP1,VP2 and VP3 sequences was carried out by comparisons with reference sequences in GenBank using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool available at the U.S. National Center of Biotechnology Information. The sequences were then aligned using ClustalW included in MEGA7 [47]. Monoclonal antibodies Antibodies were isolated from human individuals who were naturally infected with EV-A71 in Taiwan as previously described [24]. Heavy and light chain plasmids were transfected into 293T cells for human monoclonal antibody expression. Representative antibodies were expanded and purified using protein A-sepharose (Merck, Germany). Neutralization of serum and monoclonal antibody with enteroviruses Neutralizing titers of sera and monoclonal antibodies with EV-A71 were measured by a method as previously described [24]. Briefly, serially diluted samples were incubated with an equal volume of 100 TCID 50 virus at 37°C for 2 hours. Then, the rhabdomyosarcoma cell suspension was added to the virus-antibody mixture and incubated at 37°C for 4–5 days. For each assay, cell controls and virus back-titration were setup. Cytopathic effect was examined before and after staining of crystal violet. The neutralization titer is defined as the reciprocal of highest dilution for which the cytopathic effect was prevented in triplicate culture wells. Selection of escape mutants with human monoclonal antibodies Wild-type plaque-purified EV-A71 were diluted to 50 TCID 50 times neutralization titer against tested monoclonal antibody of 25 μg/ml and incubated with an equal volume of monoclonal antibody at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml for 1 hour at room temperature. The mixture was then added to the flat-bottomed well containing a confluent monolayer of rhabdomyosarcoma cells and incubated at 37°C for 5 days. If there was no cytopathic effect observed, the cells and supernatant were collected, freeze-thawed three times, filtered, and then re-infected a fresh preparation of RD cell layer at 37°C for 4 days. Once cytopathic effect of cells was observed at first or second re-infection cycle, the cells and supernatant were collected and freeze-thawed three times. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, virus-containing solution was harvested and then the virus was plaque-purified. In the study, one to two re-infection cycles were needed for the presence of cytopathic effect and the development of mAb-resistant mutants. Plaque-purified antibody-resistant mutants were confirmed by testing the abolishment of binding in the flow cytometry-based binding assay and neutralization in the cytopathic effect-based neutralization assay by antibody. Neutralizing activities of monoclonal antibodies with EV-A71 were measured by a method as previously described [24]. The flow cytometry-based binding assay was performed as previously described [24]. A confluent monolayer of RD cells were incubated with the optimized infectious dose of EV-A71 one day before the experiment. The next day, the cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended. Fixed and permeabilized cells were blocked with saponin-3% BSA. After blocking, cells were incubated with purified monoclonal antibodies (5 μg/ml) in BD Perm/Wash buffer and mouse IgG antibody to EV-A71 3C (1 μg/ml)(GeneTex, USA). Bound antibodies were detected with fluorescence-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibodies (Goat anti-human and Goat anti-mouse IgG) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in BD Perm/Wash buffer. Cells were analyzed with a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer. Results were derived from an analysis of 10,000 gated events of EV-A71-infected (3C-positive) cells and are shown as the percentage of EV-A71-infected cells that bound human anti-EV-A71 antibodies. Mock-infected RD cells were used as an antigen control, and the EV-A71 convalescent serum, an anti-EV-A71 VP2 mouse monoclonal antibody MAB979 (EMD Millipore, USA) and PBS were used as antibody controls for each experiment. Viral RNAs of escape mutants and parental EV-A71 strain TW-225-2019 (genotype C1) were isolated using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with FL-R primer (5’- TTTTTTTTTTGCTATTCYGGTTATAACAAAT-3’) using a ReverTra Ace cDNA synthesis kit (TOYOBO, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out for amplification of the VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1 genes using a KOD -Plus- kit (TOYOBO, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The primers used for the cDNA amplification were as follows: C1-VP4-F: 5’-ATCCGGTGTCTAACAGAGC-3’, C1-VP4-R: 5’-CACTCACCATAGCCAACTAT-3’; C1-VP2-F: 5’-ACAGAGCCTTAAACAAGATCCAGAT-3’, C1-VP2-R: 5’-AAAGTTCGGCAGGATGGGTGC-3’; C1-VP3-F: 5’-TTCGACCAAGGAGCGACAC-3’, C1-VP3-R: 5’-CTGTAGGCGCTGGTAAAGC-3’; C1-VP1-F: 5’-GCAGCAGCCCAGAAAAA-3’, C1-VP1-R: 5’-AAGGTTTGCCCAATCATTGTG-3’. PCR products were gel purified. The Sanger method was used to for direct sequencing of the VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1 DNA products. The primers for sequencing were the same primers used for polymerase chain reactions. The VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1 sequences of escape mutants were compared with those of parental virus to identify point mutations. In vivo animal study All animal studies were performed using protocols approved by the Chang Gung University Animal Care Institutional Review Board and in accordance with the ‘Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals’, the recommendations of the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International Standards. The hSCARB2-transgenic mice (C57BL/6 background) were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facilities of National Laboratory Animal Center and Chang Gung University, Taiwan. Three-week-old mice were randomly divided into groups and infected intraperitoneally with 10 times 50% lethal dose of EV-A71 24 hours after an intraperitoneal administration of monoclonal antibody at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Mice were weighed daily and mice with 20% weight loss were humanely killed. Statistics The TCID 50 in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line for EV-A71 were calculated by Reed-Muench method. The neutralizing concentrations of MAbs with the genotype B5 and C1 EV-A71 was compared using the two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test. The binding activity of MAbs with EV-A71 in the flow cytometry-based binding assay was compared between groups using the two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test. In the mice challenge study, the weight change following infection was measured and the comparison of weight change among groups was analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Graphs were presented by Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism software."

Eli Lilly… [+10901 chars]","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he disagrees with the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention telling lawmakers that wearing a mask is guaranteed to protect people more from the novel coronavirus than a vaccine.  Trump said at a White House news conference that a mask is “not more effective by any means than a vaccine, and I called him about that.”  Trump’s comments were the second time he questioned the testimony of the CDC’s Robert Redfield on Wednesday. Earlier, he said Redfield was wrong in his estimation of how fast a potential vaccine will be available to the general public.  Trump says that “I hope the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the mask.” He also says that “the mask perhaps helps.”  Trump says he still has confidence in Redfield.  ___  HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK  — CDC director: Scientific integrity unchanged despite White House pressure  — Eli Lilly says antibody study gives hint of help for COVID-19 patients  — UK to ration COVID-19 testing amid testing failures  — The U.S. government released a sweeping plan to make vaccines for the coronavirus available for free to all Americans, assuming a safe and effective shot is developed.  — South Africa’s minister of health says about 12 million people have “probably” been infected with the coronavirus. That’s more than 20% of South Africa’s population of 58 million.  — The Big Ten Conference will give fall football a shot after all. It reversed a decision to push the season to spring after push back from lawmakers, coaches and parents and President Trump.  ___  Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  ___  HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:  HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pennsylvania’s top lawyer is asking a federal judge to keep in place Gov. Tom Wolf’s limits on crowd size, arguing that allowing large groups to congregate “will result in people’s deaths” from the coronavirus.  The office of Attorney General Josh Shapiro urged U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV on Wednesday to delay enforcement of his ruling that many of the governor’s pandemic shutdown orders are unconstitutional.  Stickman has said the state’s size limits for indoor and outdoor gatherings violate citizens’ constitutional right to assemble. The state has been enforcing a gathering limit of 25 people for indoor events and 250 for those held outside.  Shapiro’s office says Stickman’s ruling “does not consider the manner in which COVID-19 is spread or the rationale for adopting the congregate limits.” Its points out that other federal judges and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court have upheld Wolf’s pandemic shutdown orders.  ___  COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio has enacted a law that bars local or state officials from closing churches or other houses of worship and that bans the changing of election dates.  The legislation signed Wednesday by Gov. Mike DeWine was pushed through by Republican lawmakers in reaction to such orders as part of coronavirus containment measures. DeWine had refrained from shutting down religious institutions during the pandemic, but some other governors have restricted religious gatherings.  The new law also takes aim at DeWine’s eleventh hour decision in March to postpone the state’s in-person primary because of concerns about the coronavirus. The statute forbids moving elections other than from the “time, place and manner” spelled out in state law.  ___  ANNAPOLIS, Md. — It will likely be at least six to eight months longer before a coronavirus vaccine can be distributed in a best-case scenario, leading Maryland health officials and lawmakers said as they make plans for the state.  Senate President Bill Ferguson said he spoke on Tuesday with one of the principal investigators at Johns Hopkins University who is working on a vaccine now in its third phase. While there has been remarkable progress, Ferguson said Wednesday that the logistics that go into distributing a vaccine are “enormous and herculean.”  “I think it’s really important that we keep that in mind moving forward as we make decisions about the future of Maryland — that even with an amazing light-speed approval, it is still six to eight months from that point until we’ll start to see the impact on herd immunity overall, so there is time to go in this ballgame,” Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said during a meeting of a legislative panel on the coronavirus.  Robert Neall, Maryland’s health secretary, emphasized that people need to be prepared to use available tools like masks and handwashing well into next year.  ___  BERLIN — Germany has declared three European capitals and several regions “risk areas” for coronavirus.  The Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the Austrian capital Vienna, Budapest in Hungary and the Dutch region that includes Amsterdam were added to the risk list due to high numbers of COVID-19 infections there.  Also listed were several regions in France, Romania, Croatia, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.  Travellers arriving in Germany from those locations have to go into mandatory quarantine and take a coronavirus test.  ___  ISTANBUL — Turkey’s health minister says Phase 3 trials for China’s Sinovac Biotech’s two-step vaccine have begun in Turkey with three Turkish health workers.  Fahrettin Koca said Wednesday the trial would expand to 1,200 volunteers and then to 10,000. He said trials for a Pfizer vaccine were also beginning and others were pending, adding that he hoped widespread vaccinations would start towards the end of 2020.  ___  UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations chief says the COVID-19 pandemic remains “out of control,” with the world approaching “the grimmest of milestones: 1 million lives lost to the virus.”  Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a news conference Wednesday that the coronavirus “is the number one global security threat in our world today,” posing a crisis that is “unlike any in our lifetimes.”  He said that’s why he called for a global cease-fire on March 23 to tackle the pandemic.  And in his speech to world leaders at next Tuesday’s mainly virtual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, Guterres said he will make “a strong appeal to the international community to mobilize all efforts for the global cease-fire to become a reality by the end of the year.”  The secretary-general urged the international community to come together to defeat the virus, stressing that a vaccine alone can’t solve the crisis.  ___  JOHANNESBURG — South Africa’s president says the country will reopen for international travel as of Oct. 1 after confirmed coronavirus cases have dropped dramatically in recent weeks.  President Cyril Ramaphosa says visitors may not be allowed from countries deemed at high risk and a list of countries will be published in the coming days.  Visitors will be required to show negative test results for the virus no older than 72 hours before departure. Those who didn’t test before departure will be required to stay in quarantine at their own cost.  International flights will be allowed only at the country’s three main airports in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.  ___  WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Wednesday was asked whether the White House was now counting on herd immunity to deal with the virus.  President Donald Trump said during an ABC News town hall on Tuesday that eventually there will be herd immunity to the virus, but that with a vaccine, the virus will go away “very quickly.”  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  For the United States to reach herd immunity against the coronavirus, most experts say, the nation would likely need to vaccinate roughly 70% of Americans.  “Herd immunity has never been a strategy here at the White House,” McEnany said. “The president last night was noting ... (that) over a period of time a country, a society, can reach herd immunity. It’s a fact. It was not a strategy ever presented here at the White House.“  ___  LONDON — The U.K. has recorded nearly 4,000 new coronavirus cases for the first time since May amid mounting concerns the country is on the verge of a second wave.  Government figures show new cases rising to 3,991, up markedly from Tuesday’s figure of 3,105. Though more testing is picking up more cases, it’s clear the virus is spreading. The latest daily increase is more than two times the level reported a few weeks back.  Officials recently banned social gatherings in England of more than six people both indoors and outdoors. Though many of the recent cases involve younger people, there are concerns more vulnerable people may become infected.  The government reported Wednesday another 20 people died within 28 days after testing positive for COVID-19, the new U.K. cutoff for official deaths instituted in the last few weeks.  That takes the death toll to 41,684, Europe’s highest and fifth highest in the world. On Aug. 20, the reported death toll in the U.K. was 41,483.  ___  BUDAPEST, Hungary — Hungary’s prime minister set a maximum price for coronavirus tests, extended mandatory use of face masks and ordered temperature checks at school for all students and teachers starting Oct. 1.  Viktor Orban says in a video posted on Facebook that tests cannot cost more than 19,500 forints ($64.50). Wearing masks, already obligatory on public transportation and stores, will be extended to theatres, cinemas, health care and social institutions, among others, and nightclubs must close at 11 p.m.  Orban says the health care system was prepared to deal with the second wave of the pandemic, with a plan to increase the availability of hospital beds and deploy doctors and nurses where needed.  ___  BERLIN — German public broadcaster ARD reports a far-right lawmaker in the national Parliament has tested positive for the coronavirus.  ARD quoted the Alternative for Germany party confirming Wednesday that Norbert Kleinwaechter was tested positive for COVID-19 and informed his caucus Tuesday. Six other lawmakers for the party and several parliamentary staff he’d been in contact with were sent home to isolate.  Some Alternative for Germany lawmakers took part in protests against pandemic restrictions in recent months.  Germany’s disease control centre says the country recorded 1,901 new infections in the past day, taking the total to nearly 264,000. Germany has confirmed 9,368 COVID-related deaths since the start of the outbreak.  ___  WASHINGTON — The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Senate lawmakers that his agency has not altered its scientific publications on the coronavirus.  That comes despite pressure from Trump officials who allege the agency has worked against the re-election of President Donald Trump.  Dr. Robert Redfield testified that the CDC’s “scientific integrity ... has not been compromised and it will not be compromised under my watch.”  Last week news outlets reported that Michael Caputo, a Health and Human Services Department political appointee, tried to gain editorial control over CDC’s weekly scientific report. In a separate online video last week, Caputo reportedly said some CDC scientists constituted a “resistance unit” conspiring against the Trump administration.  Redfield rejected the allegation and says he was “deeply saddened” by the comments.  Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the committee’s top Democrat, says the apparent political pressure on CDC, among other health agencies, had damaged public trust in federal health information.  ___  BOULDER, Colo. — All students at the University of Colorado’s main campus are being told to self-quarantine for the next two weeks to stem an alarming rise in coronavirus cases.  Jeffrey J. Zayach, executive director of Boulder County Public Health, urged the measure in a letter Zayach sent Tuesday to Boulder campus students, faculty and staff. Zayach warned mandatory restrictions could follow if students do not comply.  University officials reported 13 positive tests the first week of school, 90 the second week and 205 the third week. Most cases involved students who live off-campus.  Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist, says there’s been six coronavirus outbreaks at Colorado colleges and universities.  ___  JOHANNESBURG — A new survey across 18 African countries finds a “worryingly high levels of misinformation” related to the coronavirus pandemic.  The phone survey conducted last month indicates just over one in three people agreed with the inaccurate statements that foreigners were trying to test vaccines on the population and they were trying to discredit African medicines.  The countries where more than 40% of respondents agreed with the statements were Tunisia, Senegal, Guinea and Cameroon. Nandita Murukutla, of the public health organization Vital Strategies, called such misinformation “potentially harmful.”  In other survey highlights, 45% of people say they missed or delayed health care services because of the pandemic and 72% reported barriers in accessing food."

The flights, however, are reserved for Vietnamese nationals, diplomats, experts, managers, skilled workers, investors and their families. They are not yet available for tourists.  ADVERTISEMENT  According to a report on the government website, flights connecting Vietnam’s two largest cities — Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City — to destinations in South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan will operate on a weekly basis. Flights connecting the cities with Cambodia and Laos will resume next week.  To board a flight, passengers must hold a certificate showing they have tested negative for the coronavirus no more than five days before the departure date. Upon arrival, they will be tested and placed under quarantine, the report said.  Vietnam shut down international flights on April 1. National carrier Vietnam Airlines estimated last month that it would lose $650 million in 2020.  Vietnam has reported 1,059 cases of the coronavirus. It managed to avoid any deaths until July, when the virus crept into the city of Da Nang, killing 35 people.  But no new cases have been reported for two weeks. Last week, Da Nang lifted a travel restriction after two months.  Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region:  — India’s coronavirus confirmed cases crossed 5 million on Wednesday, still soaring and testing the country’s feeble health care system in tens of thousands of impoverished towns and villages. The Health Ministry reported 90,123 new cases in the past 24 hours, raising the nation’s confirmed total to 5,020,359, about 0.35% of its nearly 1.4 billion population. It said 1,290 more people died in the past 24 hours, for a total of 82,066. India’s total coronavirus caseload is closing in on the United States’ highest tally of more than 6.6 million cases and expected to surpass it within weeks. India reported a record daily high of 97,570 cases on Sept. 11 and has added more than 1 million cases this month alone.  — South Korea’s daily coronavirus tally has stayed below 200 for two weeks, but the government is urging people not to lower their guard. Authorities said Wednesday that the 113 cases added in the last 24 hours took the country’s total to 22,504, including 367 deaths. Eighty-one of them were in the Seoul metropolitan area, the heart of a recent viral resurgence in South Korea. Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip called on people to refrain from having unnecessary gatherings and visiting crowded places."

That is almost double the official death toll of 11,318 reported for the pandemic in Mexico City.  ADVERTISEMENT  The head of the city’s Digital Innovation Agency says there were 30,462 “excess deaths” in the city between April 1 and the end of August, about two-thirds of which were determined to be due to coronavirus. David Merino wrote in his Twitter account that 92% of those deaths were in hospitals and 7% at private residences.  Like all of Mexico, the city of almost 9 million inhabitants has had an extremely low testing rate and officials acknowledge that the number of test-confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths probably undercounts the real figures.  ___  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is disagreeing with the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the potential availability of a coronavirus vaccine to the general public.  Trump promised Wednesday that a vaccine will be available much sooner than was projected in congressional testimony earlier in the day by Dr. Robert Redfield.  Trump says Redfield “made a mistake” when he told lawmakers that any vaccine available in November or December would be in “very limited supply,” and reserved for first responders and people most vulnerable to COVID-19. Redfield estimated the shot wouldn’t be broadly available until the spring or summer of 2021.

Trump said at a White House news conference that a mask is “not more effective by any means than a vaccine, and I called him about that.”  Trump’s comments were the second time he questioned the testimony of the CDC’s Robert Redfield on Wednesday. Earlier, he said Redfield was wrong in his estimation of how fast a potential vaccine will be available to the general public.  Trump says that “I hope the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the mask.” He also says that “the mask perhaps helps.”  Trump says he still has confidence in Redfield.  ___  HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pennsylvania’s top lawyer is asking a federal judge to keep in place Gov. Tom Wolf’s limits on crowd size, arguing that allowing large groups to congregate “will result in people’s deaths” from the coronavirus.  The office of Attorney General Josh Shapiro urged U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV on Wednesday to delay enforcement of his ruling that many of the governor’s pandemic shutdown orders are unconstitutional.  Stickman has said the state’s size limits for indoor and outdoor gatherings violate citizens’ constitutional right to assemble. The state has been enforcing a gathering limit of 25 people for indoor events and 250 for those held outside.  Shapiro’s office says Stickman’s ruling “does not consider the manner in which COVID-19 is spread or the rationale for adopting the congregate limits.” Its points out that other federal judges and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court have upheld Wolf’s pandemic shutdown orders.  ___  COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio has enacted a law that bars local or state officials from closing churches or other houses of worship and that bans the changing of election dates.  The legislation signed Wednesday by Gov. Mike DeWine was pushed through by Republican lawmakers in reaction to such orders as part of coronavirus containment measures. DeWine had refrained from shutting down religious institutions during the pandemic, but some other governors have restricted religious gatherings.  The new law also takes aim at DeWine’s eleventh hour decision in March to postpone the state’s in-person primary because of concerns about the coronavirus. The statute forbids moving elections other than from the “time, place and manner” spelled out in state law.  ___  ANNAPOLIS, Md. — It will likely be at least six to eight months longer before a coronavirus vaccine can be distributed in a best-case scenario, leading Maryland health officials and lawmakers said as they make plans for the state.  Senate President Bill Ferguson said he spoke on Tuesday with one of the principal investigators at Johns Hopkins University who is working on a vaccine now in its third phase. While there has been remarkable progress, Ferguson said Wednesday that the logistics that go into distributing a vaccine are “enormous and herculean.”  “I think it’s really important that we keep that in mind moving forward as we make decisions about the future of Maryland — that even with an amazing light-speed approval, it is still six to eight months from that point until we’ll start to see the impact on herd immunity overall, so there is time to go in this ballgame,” Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said during a meeting of a legislative panel on the coronavirus.  Robert Neall, Maryland’s health secretary, emphasized that people need to be prepared to use available tools like masks and handwashing well into next year.  ___  BERLIN — Germany has declared three European capitals and several regions “risk areas” for coronavirus.  The Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the Austrian capital Vienna, Budapest in Hungary and the Dutch region that includes Amsterdam were added to the risk list due to high numbers of COVID-19 infections there.  Also listed were several regions in France, Romania, Croatia, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.  Travelers arriving in Germany from those locations have to go into mandatory quarantine and take a coronavirus test.  ___  ISTANBUL — Turkey’s health minister says Phase 3 trials for China’s Sinovac Biotech’s two-step vaccine have begun in Turkey with three Turkish health workers.  Fahrettin Koca said Wednesday the trial would expand to 1,200 volunteers and then to 10,000. He said trials for a Pfizer vaccine were also beginning and others were pending, adding that he hoped widespread vaccinations would start towards the end of 2020.  ___  UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations chief says the COVID-19 pandemic remains “out of control,” with the world approaching “the grimmest of milestones: 1 million lives lost to the virus.”  Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a news conference Wednesday that the coronavirus “is the number one global security threat in our world today,” posing a crisis that is “unlike any in our lifetimes.”  He said that’s why he called for a global cease-fire on March 23 to tackle the pandemic.  And in his speech to world leaders at next Tuesday’s mainly virtual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, Guterres said he will make “a strong appeal to the international community to mobilize all efforts for the global cease-fire to become a reality by the end of the year.”  The secretary-general urged the international community to come together to defeat the virus, stressing that a vaccine alone can’t solve the crisis.  ___  JOHANNESBURG — South Africa’s president says the country will reopen for international travel as of Oct. 1 after confirmed coronavirus cases have dropped dramatically in recent weeks.  President Cyril Ramaphosa says visitors may not be allowed from countries deemed at high risk and a list of countries will be published in the coming days.  Visitors will be required to show negative test results for the virus no older than 72 hours before departure. Those who didn’t test before departure will be required to stay in quarantine at their own cost.  International flights will be allowed only at the country’s three main airports in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.  ___  WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Wednesday was asked whether the White House was now counting on herd immunity to deal with the virus.  President Donald Trump said during an ABC News town hall on Tuesday that eventually there will be herd immunity to the virus, but that with a vaccine, the virus will go away “very quickly.”  For the United States to reach herd immunity against the coronavirus, most experts say, the nation would likely need to vaccinate roughly 70% of Americans.  “Herd immunity has never been a strategy here at the White House,” McEnany said. “The president last night was noting ... (that) over a period of time a country, a society, can reach herd immunity. It’s a fact. It was not a strategy ever presented here at the White House.”  ___  LONDON — The U.K. has recorded nearly 4,000 new coronavirus cases for the first time since May amid mounting concerns the country is on the verge of a second wave.  Government figures show new cases rising to 3,991, up markedly from Tuesday’s figure of 3,105. Though more testing is picking up more cases, it’s clear the virus is spreading. The latest daily increase is more than two times the level reported a few weeks back.  Officials recently banned social gatherings in England of more than six people both indoors and outdoors. Though many of the recent cases involve younger people, there are concerns more vulnerable people may become infected.  The government reported Wednesday another 20 people died within 28 days after testing positive for COVID-19, the new U.K. cutoff for official deaths instituted in the last few weeks.  That takes the death toll to 41,684, Europe’s highest and fifth highest in the world. On Aug. 20, the reported death toll in the U.K. was 41,483.  ___  BUDAPEST, Hungary — Hungary’s prime minister set a maximum price for coronavirus tests, extended mandatory use of face masks and ordered temperature checks at school for all students and teachers starting Oct. 1.  Viktor Orban says in a video posted on Facebook that tests cannot cost more than 19,500 forints ($64.50). Wearing masks, already obligatory on public transportation and stores, will be extended to theaters, cinemas, health care and social institutions, among others, and nightclubs must close at 11 p.m.  Orban says the health care system was prepared to deal with the second wave of the pandemic, with a plan to increase the availability of hospital beds and deploy doctors and nurses where needed.  ___  BERLIN — German public broadcaster ARD reports a far-right lawmaker in the national Parliament has tested positive for the coronavirus.  ARD quoted the Alternative for Germany party confirming Wednesday that Norbert Kleinwaechter was tested positive for COVID-19 and informed his caucus Tuesday. Six other lawmakers for the party and several parliamentary staff he’d been in contact with were sent home to isolate.  Some Alternative for Germany lawmakers took part in protests against pandemic restrictions in recent months.  Germany’s disease control center says the country recorded 1,901 new infections in the past day, taking the total to nearly 264,000. Germany has confirmed 9,368 COVID-related deaths since the start of the outbreak."

Then came the Covid-19 pandemic that infected almost 30 million people and killed nearly 10 lakh worldwide till the filing of this story.  Economies around the world collapsed, job losses are at a peak and several sectors witnessed a doom. Natural disasters followed in different parts of the globe, leading to further bloodbath. India, for example, witnessed floods, cyclones, earthquakes, and a bloody border confrontation all in the past eight months.  Many are convinced 2020 is a cursed year, the worst in the history of human civilisation. But is it really so? India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) went back in time in search of the answer.  536 CE and following years  Let’s look at why one must thank their lucky stars that they live now, and not 15 odd centuries ago.  To begin with, the problem with 536 CE was the weather it turned bad when two massive volcanic eruptions covered the Earth with dense fog and blocked out the sun. Temperatures dropped, and in parts of the northern hemisphere, it began to snow in summer. And naturally, it messed up the food supply chain and caused famines all across present-day Europe and neighbouring regions.  Michael McCormick, Francis Goelet Professor of Medieval History at Harvard University, says, “The year 536 was bad for food production and much else probably globally, but at least in the northern hemisphere. Even more important may have been the as yet ill-understood links with subsequent volcanism over the following years, the triggering of the Late Antique Little Ice Age in 536 and most important, the outbreak of the Justinianic Pandemic of the bubonic plague, beginning 541 in Egypt.”  What McCormick was saying was that soon after 536 CE was over and people somewhat began to relax, a bad case of plague hit Europe around 541 CE and drove the last nail through the heart of the Byzantine Empire. Even in those dark days when antiquity was making way for the medieval period in Europe, fingers were pointing eastwards, blaming China and the orient for sending them the plague.  Those early Europeans were naturally upset because the plague hung around for some 200 hundred years particularly in the Mediterranean region. By the time it petered out around 750 CE, it had killed around 100 million people.  Plague wise, it was all hunky dory for the next six centuries, but then the black days returned in the West. Between 1347 and 1352, a bubonic plague that originated from Central Asia accompanied Mongol travellers and traders and made its way into Europe.  And once again, a plague that rose in the East did away with about a quarter of Europe’s then population. For nearly 600 years since, though there were smaller epidemics here and there in the West, the world did not see a pandemic till the Flu hit in the early 20th century.  The Spanish flu pandemic  The year was 1918 when H1N1 influenza turned into a pandemic, infecting nearly one in every three people in the world. Some 500 million people were infected and 50 million died. In India, it hit in the northern parts of the country, leading to an estimated 12-13 million deaths, which was around 4-6 percent of the population.  John M Barry, an American historian and author of “The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History”, says, “In the 1918-20 pandemic, India suffered at least 10 million deaths from influenza, and it’s quite possible that the toll exceeded 20 million. Case mortality for Indian soldiers in the British Army exceeded 20 per cent. On top of that, crop shortages combined with continued export of food to support British war efforts, caused near-famine conditions in some areas.”  So the years 1918 to 1920 must have been bad for those who lived in those times, but in India, people still speak about the Great Bengal Famine of 1770s with a shudder.  That particular famine wiped out a third of the population of the larger Bengal region, which included parts of present-day West Bengal, all of Bangladesh and parts of Bihar and Odisha. Historians later calculated that at least 10 million people had died out of starvation in the years from 1769 up till 1773. Traces of the pain and trauma of the famine can be found in Bengal’s literary references.  When questioned which would be the worst year for humanity, historian Rana Safvi says misery is subjective, and different people would call different years their worst, depending on their experiences.  Misery is subjective and there are many events that humanity has survived not collectively as a species but as a subset of that identity. Wars, conquests, colonisation and slavery have killed millions around the world subset identities dreadfully impacting humankind as a whole.  Horrors of modern-day war  If we go back a hundred years (that is when our grandparents or great grandparents were living), some 20 million people perished in a span of just four years. About 75,000 were Indians fighting a white man’s war World War I.  Just 30 years later, Adolf Hitler set off to conquer the world. Result: 85 million civilian and military lives were lost in the Second World War. This time, 2 million Indians died for the sake of the King or because of his call for war.  But the Indian death toll did not take into account another famine that primarily happened because the British overlords took grain out of Bengal for their armies at war. The Bengal famine of 1943-44 witnessed three million deaths due to starvation. The older generations still remember those horrid days, and multiple films and books have kept the hunger alive in the psyche of the younger generations.  The year 1943 could vie for the epithet of Bengal’s worst year, but modern-day Bangladesh might object because of ‘Operation Searchlight’ that the Pakistani Army unleashed in then East Pakistan in 1971. This operation was aimed at curbing the Bengali nationalist movement which was opposing Urdu imposition by West Pakistan.  It is another matter that 1971 also turned out to be the year that Bangladesh was born, but estimates say three million people died in the genocide, mainly of Bengali Hindus, and 10 million were driven away across the border into India.  For people of Jewish faith, the years with Hitler at the helm in Germany would be the worst as he evolved a factory system to kill 6 million Jews and usurp everything they owned from life to gold teeth to even the skin on their bodies. It was the worst systematic experiment ever carried out on human beings.  For someone in Japan, 1945 would probably be the worst year in the country’s history because of what ‘Little Boy’ and ‘Fat Man’ did when the US dropped these nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The year 1947 could also be in the running for the worst year ever for the Indian sub-continent. While two countries were born that year, an ancient land bled, shedding tears of blood as centuries-old roots were uprooted and chopped in a gory dance of creation and destruction.  Historian Rana Safvi, when asked which year she believes is the worst in Indian history, said, “For me, though I wasn’t born then, but as I’ve heard and read, 1947 would be the worst year. The Partition displaced 15 million people and killed over a million.”  There is no beginning to the accounting, forget the ending, of indigenous tribes wiped out in Australia and Northern America, the common Flu decimating the Polynesian Islands, colonial armies running amok, slave traders hunting humans in the African bushes, leaders such as Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse-tung dehumanising and killing fellow countrymen by tens of millions, the ethnic cleansing of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottomans of Turkey, the Hutu-Tutsi killings in Rwanda, monuments of empty skulls in Cambodia, and endless other miseries, all of it dependent on who got stuck where and in which year.  Which brings us to our year of being and is it the worst ever. Historian John M Barry says, “2020 is not even close to the worst year to survive.”  Experts have mixed opinions  Professor Michael McCormick, who had claimed 536 AD to be the worst year, had this to say about 2020: “It has clearly been a bad year so far and we are only 2/3 of the way through. And it’s important to realise that medium- and long-term consequences of most events remain hidden for some time as the complex chains of causality form over weeks, months, decades, and even centuries, until astute journalists and historians begin to detect them.”  But according to Professor Burton Cleetus, a medicine historian at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University’s department of history, 2020 is actually the worst year from a psychological point of view.  Professor Cleetus said, “The year 2020 is the worst primarily, if we are measuring the discourse of the disease. With schools shut, businesses running down and restrictions on many activities, people tend to believe that their lives have come to a stagnant situation.”  Professor Syed Irfan Habib, historian of science and modern political history and former Maulana Azad Chair at the National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration in Delhi, believes it will be incorrect to call 2020 the worst year in Indian history.  Professor Habib said, “The year 2020 has been bad for sure, but we cannot call it the worst in history. Certainly, the virus has impacted people from all strata of society, though we are hoping that this will be over by the end of this year. If it continues to spread like this, then we might have to think afresh.”  So there we have it; the jury is out on the current year. Whether 2020 is the worst year ever will only be known retrospectively. Sometime in the future, there will be debates on whether 536 AD, 2020 or some other tumultuous year in the future is the worst."

The head of the city’s Digital Innovation Agency says there were 30,462 “excess deaths” in the city between April 1 and the end of August, about two-thirds of which were determined to be due to coronavirus. David Merino wrote in his Twitter account that 92% of those deaths were in hospitals and 7% at private residences.

The flights, however, are reserved for Vietnamese nationals, diplomats, experts, managers, skilled workers, investors and their families. They are not yet available for tourists.  According to a report on the government website, flights connecting Vietnam’s two largest cities — Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City — to destinations in South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan will operate on a weekly basis. Flights connecting the cities with Cambodia and Laos will resume next week.  To board a flight, passengers must hold a certificate showing they have tested negative for the coronavirus no more than five days before the departure date. Upon arrival, they will be tested and placed under quarantine, the report said.  Vietnam shut down international flights on April 1. National carrier Vietnam Airlines estimated last month that it would lose $650 million in 2020.  Vietnam has reported 1,059 cases of the coronavirus. It managed to avoid any deaths until July, when the virus crept into the city of Da Nang, killing 35 people.  But no new cases have been reported for two weeks. Last week, Da Nang lifted a travel restriction after two months.  Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region:  — India’s coronavirus confirmed cases crossed 5 million on Wednesday, still soaring and testing the country’s feeble health care system in tens of thousands of impoverished towns and villages. The Health Ministry reported 90,123 new cases in the past 24 hours, raising the nation’s confirmed total to 5,020,359, about 0.35% of its nearly 1.4 billion population. It said 1,290 more people died in the past 24 hours, for a total of 82,066. India’s total coronavirus caseload is closing in on the United States’ highest tally of more than 6.6 million cases and expected to surpass it within weeks. India reported a record daily high of 97,570 cases on Sept. 11 and has added more than 1 million cases this month alone.  — South Korea’s daily coronavirus tally has stayed below 200 for two weeks, but the government is urging people not to lower their guard. Authorities said Wednesday that the 113 cases added in the last 24 hours took the country’s total to 22,504, including 367 deaths. Eighty-one of them were in the Seoul metropolitan area, the heart of a recent viral resurgence in South Korea. Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip called on people to refrain from having unnecessary gatherings and visiting crowded places."

George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News  MANILA - Philippine households were among the worst affected by the pandemic in Southeast Asia, a recent survey by the Asian Development Bank showed.  The ADB Institute said it recently did a survey of households in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Based on the survey, 84 percent of households in the Philippines said their income declined because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the worst in the region, followed by Indonesia at 81 percent and Myanmar at 78 percent. The average for the 8 ASEAN countries was 73 percent.  At least one person also became unemployed or had their work hours reduced in 73.5 percent of Philippine households. Again, this was the worst across the countries surveyed. The average for 8 ASEAN countries surveyed was 44 percent.  The state statistics agency said 10 percent or around 4.6 million of adult Filipinos were jobless as of July. An independent survey meanwhile put the jobless rate at a much higher 45.5 percent or around 27.3 million unemployed Filipinos as of July.  The Philippines implemented one of the world’s strictest and longest lockdowns from March to June in an attempt to check the spread of COVID-19. Despite this, the country still ended up with the highest number of confirmed infections in the region as it struggled to ramp up testing and contact-tracing.  “Many governments had very strict measures like lockdowns, but it turned out those across-the-board measures are very counterproductive,” said ADB Institute Dean Tetsushi Sonobe during a virtual conference on the results of the study.  In place of wholesale lockdowns, Sonobe called a more targetted approach to contain the virus.  “There must be more testing, more fine-tuning [of] regulation on containment measures, more granular information area-wise, sector-wise, time-wise, or specific hours of the day, or specific days of the week, depending on the sector, to make the economy more active.""  Medium, small and micro enterprises, which are key employers in the Philippines, were the most affected businesses.  Going digital will help MSMEs continue to operate and remain competitive, but this is hampered by internet connectivity issues, an ADB official said.  ""Connectivity must be addressed before MSMEs can adopt digital solutions,” said Elaine Tan, Advisor and Head of ADB's Statistics and Data Innovation Unit. --- Report from Warren de Guzman, ABS-CBN News"

Inside, however, is the Fundación National Francisco Franco, or Francisco Franco National Foundation, an institution that preserves the memory of the man who ruled Spain for nearly four decades until his death in 1975.  To some, it is a shrine to a fascist dictator, which should not exist in democratic Spain in the 21st century.  To others, it guards the flame of a man who spared the country from communism, presided over its reconstruction after its devastating civil war, and saved it from being drawn into the Second World War.  Almost every centimeter of the walls are filled with paintings or photographs of Franco while the offices contain important papers of state signed by El Caudillo (The Leader) which are consulted by historians.  The foundation is now under threat after the Socialist government passed a law on Tuesday which will ban the organization for “glorifying the dictatorship.”  A man carries one of the 46 coffins of unidentified people killed during the Spanish Civil War, at San Jose cemetery, Pamplona, northern Spain, April 1, 2019.  The Democratic Memory bill, which must pass through the parliament and should come into force by the end of the year, will bring in a raft of 66 measures which, supporters say, will help Spain finally deal with a murky chapter of its recent history which it has ignored since returning to democracy in 1978.  For the first time, public funds – totaling $533,000 - will be used to help families trace the remains of thousands of loved ones who were killed during the civil war and afterwards and their remains dumped in mass graves across the country.  A DNA database will be created to help find 114,000 people who historians list as missing.  It will also declare trials conducted during Franco’s rule null and void and appoint a special prosecutor to investigate human rights abuses carried out during that period.  The Valley of the Fallen, with its huge mausoleum where Franco's remains were buried for four decades until the Socialist government ordered their exhumation last year, will be turned into a civilian cemetery only for those who died on both sides of the civil war.  Exhumation of a mass grave of Eugenio Insua, who is one of 17 people who were killed by the forces of dictator Francisco Franco in July 1936, at the El Espinar cemetery, Spain, Sept. 3, 2020.  Lessons about the repression of political opponents under Franco will become part of the national school curriculum.  Unhealed wounds  However, the bill is hugely divisive in a country which is still struggling to deal with this part of its past.  Unlike Germany or Portugal, Spain is the only European country which has never addressed events of its wartime past, and of the long dictatorship that followed.  Franco Exhumation Inflames Spain's Political Tensions Critics accuse the government of 'electioneering' by having pushed the exhumation of the late dictator  An amnesty law passed in 1977 prohibited retrospective trials relating to events during the Franco years.  More than half a million people died during Spain’s 1936-1939 civil war that pitted leftist Republicans supported by the Soviet Union against rightist Nationalist forces led by Franco backed by Nazi Germany. An estimated 120,000 people were killed during General Franco's time in power while 450,000 were forced into exile, historians estimate.  After Burundi and Cambodia, Spain has the highest number of mass graves in the world, according to the United Nations.  Leftist political parties believe Spain must deal with this aspect of its past in order for future generations to come to terms with events under Franco’s rule.  However, conservatives see the legislation as only reviving the wounds of a conflict which happened eight decades ago.  Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish prime minister, tweeted: “Today we take another step in recognizing the victims of the civil war and the dictatorship with the Democratic Memory Law. Today we close the wounds a little more; we can look at the past with greater dignity.”  Enrique Santiago, a member of parliament for the far-left Unidas Podemos alliance, the junior partner in the coalition government, said the legislation was an improvement on a law passed in 2007 which offered reparations for victims of Franco but it stalled after a conservative government came to power in 2011 and froze funding.  Santiago said the new legislation provided state funds to search for missing victims, recognized those pressed into forced labor for the dictatorship, and will impose fines of up to $178,000 for glorifying Franco.  “This bill does not go as far as Germany which prohibited Nazism. Unfortunately, there are sectors which still revere the dictator,” he told VOA.  “We hope this (law) doesn't produce a division. We hope that this establishes the international rights which should not bother anyone,” Santiago said.  Spain divided  The sensitivity of the issue, however, was demonstrated by the swift response from the political right.  The People’s Party, the largest opposition party, said the leftist government used Franco as an excuse not to address other problems.  “Whenever Sánchez has a problem, he gets Franco out of the Valley of the Fallen,” said Javier Maroto, a party spokesman.  General Juan Chicharro Ortega, president of the Franco foundation, said the organization would challenge the law in the courts.  “This law is anti-democratic. It contravenes the Spanish constitution which guarantees the liberty of expression. It says you can only think one way and negates what half of Spaniards are thinking,” he told VOA.  Santiago Abascal, leader of the far-right Vox party, the third largest in the Spanish parliament with 52 MPs, called the law “totalitarian.”  Ciudadanos, or Citizens, a small center-right party, believes the government should address a health crisis which has seen the number of COVID-19 cases rise to over 600,000, the highest number if western Europe.  “Of course we condemn the dictatorship but I think most Spaniards right now think the government should concentrate on trying to solve the problems of the pandemic, ” Melisa Rodriguez, a Ciudadanos parliamentary spokesman, told VOA.  For the relatives of Franco's victims, the new law will bring solace.  When archaeologists were searching a mass grave last weekend, they chanced upon Eugenio Ursúa's wedding ring, ending his daughter's 84-year hunt for the father she never knew.  “It was a lovely moment. I wanted to cry. We knew my father was buried here and it was a long wait to find him and now we have,” Rosa María told VOA.  Ursúa, a 29-year-old father of two, was killed just days after the start of the civil war in 1936.  He answered a call to defend the Republican government after Franco led an armed uprising but his unit was ambushed in El Espinar, 62 kilometers north of Madrid.  Pending a DNA test, his remains will be buried next to those of his late wife.  Rosa María, who was six months old when her father died, said,“For us the search is over. This law might give other families some help to find their relatives.”"

Treasuries were steady and the dollar slipped.  After a modest dip early in the session following news that Facebook is facing an antitrust lawsuit by the FTC as early as late this year, S&P futures rebounded and hit a session high of 3,418.25 before paring gains to a 0.3% rise, as investors hoped for a renewed dovish pledge by the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low for a prolonged period, with upbeat quarterly results from FedEx also boosting sentiment. After dropping for two weeks in a row, the S&P 500 has rebounded 1.8% in the past two sessions, with defensive sectors including real estate and utilities among the biggest gainers.  FedEx soared 10% in premarket trading after reporting a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit, helped in part by price hikes and lower fuel costs. Shares in peer UPS gained 4.6%, while Robinhood darling Kodak soared over 50% after an internal legal review cleared the company of option trade improprieties. Apple rose 0.7%, after ending the previous session just marginally higher, as it rolled out a new virtual fitness service and a bundle of all its subscriptions, Apple One. Other tech-related stocks including Alphabet, Amazon.com, Tesla and Microsoft all gained between 0.6% and 1.0%.  Investors have been looking for catalysts to take markets higher after an impressive global recovery sputtered in the first half of September, with some hoping that Powell will deliver more Kool-aid by boosting its dovish stance after adopting a more relaxed approach on inflation last month. That’s helping to shore up sentiment in the face of risks ranging from U.S. presidential elections and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.  “Central banks are far from out of ammunition,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note to clients. ""Investors should be positioned for the upside in equities.""  “The Fed may follow up by announcing some new easing steps in accordance with its new regime, though the general market consensus seems to be that it will adopt a wait and watch approach,” said Lee Hardman, a strategist at MUFG in London.  The Fed's two-day meeting is its first under a newly adopted framework that promises to shoot for inflation above 2% to make up for periods where it is running below that target, in other words not to raise rates for a long, long time. The FOMC will release its policy statement and economic projections at 2 p.m. ET followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s virtual news briefing half an hour later.  On the covid front, overnight President Trump said a vaccine shot for the coronavirus could be ready within four weeks. Separately, China’s top bio-safety scientist said one may be available for public use as early as November or December.  European stocks rose for a fourth day as Zara-owner Inditex posted a quarterly profit, although UK blue-chip stocks came under pressure after a surge in the previous session. The STOXX 600 index inched 0.3% higher, extending on its winning streak. Inditex said current trade showed a progressive return to normality with online sales growing sharply and store sales recovering, pushing its shares 6.3% higher, and helping lift the Stoxx retail sector 1.1%. Meanwhile, London's FTSE100 was dragged lower by a weakness in the banking sector. A bright spot in the market was a 26.4% surge in shares of the Hut Group, the first major British initial public offering in seven years. Swiss plumbing materials company Geberit rose 1% after saying it would buy back shares worth up to 500 million Swiss francs ($551 million) over two years. Sweden's Handelsbanken rose 2.6% after revealing plans to close almost half of its branches and cut about 1,000 jobs over the next two years.  Signs of compromise emerged on the Brexit front, with Reuters reporting that Britain offered tentative concessions on fisheries in trade talks with the European Union last week, just as London was threatening to breach the terms of its divorce deal with the bloc.  “The only catalyst that I can see for European equities is Brexit that could push markets one way or the other,” said Julien Lafargue, head of equity strategy at Barclays Private Bank. “Europe, in our mind, is a trading market. You want to buy Europe when everybody hates it, you want to sell it when everybody loves it. At this stage, we’re at a neutral.”  Earlier in the session, Asian stocks also gained, led by health care and communications. Markets in the region were mixed, with Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and Taiwan's Taiex Index rising, and Jakarta Composite and Shanghai Composite falling. The Topix gained 0.2%, with Shin Nippon Bio and Marusan Securities rising the most. The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.4%, with Zhenjiang New Energy and Beijing Dahao Technology posting the biggest slides.  In FX, the U.S. dollar fell across the board on Wednesday as expectations grew that the U.S. central bank may hint at more policy action, while the Chinese yuan vaulted to its highest level since May 2019. The Bloomberg Dollar Index extended its longest losing streak in a month with a fourth consecutive day of declines after China’s central bank raised the daily reference rate for the nation’s currency and amid a continued rally in risk assets. Investors have turned bullish on China, with the prospects for the world’s No. 2 economy improving on the back of strong retail sales and industrial output data. In offshore trade, the Chinese currency, which is on track for four straight months of gains, notched a fresh 16-month high, hitting 6.7536 per dollar. “People are starting to embrace a new theme, which is that China is managing much, much better than anyone else,” said Davis Hall, head of capital markets in Asia at Indosuez Wealth Management.  ""The dollar got sold on last 3 FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) days so we continue with that pattern today"", noted Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Societe Generale. Trading could, however, easily and quickly shift soon after the statement, Commerzbank foreign exchange analyst Antje Praefcke warned via Reuters.  The Japanese yen also made significant gains during the session and touched levels not seen since the end of July, briefly going under 105 per dollar. The euro rose 0.27% to $1.1852. Sterling reversed earlier losses and rose 0.6% to $1.2995 in what would be its biggest daily rise in 2-1/2 weeks before a meeting of the Bank of England on Thursday, when policymakers may strike a downbeat assessment for the struggling economy.  In commodities, crude oil rose above $39 a barrel following a surprise drop in U.S. crude stockpiles. Gold continued trading in a narrow range, last seen at $1,963/oz.  In addition to the Fed's decision, investors are also awaiting retail sales data for August, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, with expectations of a reading of 1.0% compared with July’s figures of 1.2%.

ASX 200 (+1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) were positive with Australia buoyed as the tech and telecoms sectors found inspiration from the outperformance of their counterparts stateside, while the advances in Japan have been tempered by a firmer currency and mixed data which showed a surprise Trade Surplus and narrower than expected contraction to Exports, although Exports were still at a substantial decline and Imports missed to suggest a weak consumer profile. In addition, participants await incoming PM Suga’s inauguration and the conclusion of the BoJ’s 2-day policy meeting which kicks off today. Conversely, Hang Seng (U/C) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) lagged after a neutral PBoC liquidity operation and ongoing US-China tensions following the WTO ruling that US tariffs on China violated trade rules, as the US have spoken against the WTO announcement and President Trump suggested he may do something about the WTO following the ruling, while it was also reported the US is to announce charges related to Chinese hacking and blacklisted a Chinese developer in Cambodia, amid allegations they built facilities on land seized from locals which could be used to host military assets. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with price action stuck near the 152.00 resistance level and amid the indecisive risk tone, while participants were also tentative as the BoJ begins its 2-day policy meeting.

Cash bourses are mostly higher with the exception of the FTSEs (FTSE 100 -0.1%, FTSE MIB -0.2%) whilst broad-based gains are experienced throughout the rest of the region. UK’s FTSE sees a number of large-cap mining names consolidating after yesterday’s firm performance. Sectors across Europe are mostly higher with no real risk profile to be derived. The retail sector leads the charge, with the likes of Inditex (+7.5%) and Salvatore Ferragamo (+8.9%) propping up the sector post-earnings, whilst the IT sector coat-tails on the Wall Street sector performance yesterday. In terms of individual movers, Lufthansa (-1.6%) share remain pressured as sources said the group could cut its fleet by 130 planes and cut further jobs, altogether equating to around 28k vs. Prev. indicated 26k, while separate reports said the Co. has cut its year-end flights guidance.

However, US retail sales data looms before the big event and often possesses the potential to surprise given a wide spread of forecasts either side of consensus for the headline number and key control group GDP component. For now, the DXY is holding within a 92.852-93.189 band as major counterparts largely respect recent support, resistance and round number or psychological levels.  AUD/NZD/NOK - Marginal outperformers on a combination of factors, including strength in underlying commodities and crude, while the Aussie has piggy-backed yet another firm PBoC CNY fix and the Kiwi is underpinned by better than expected Q2 current account balances and the NZ Government upgrading its 2020 GDP and unemployment rate projections. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are consolidating above 0.7300 and 0.6700 respectively, as Eur/Nok retreats from close to 10.7200 through 10.6500.  JPY/EUR - Also firmer vs the Greenback, but the Yen and Euro are still waning ahead of 105.00 and 1.1900 amidst more decent option expiry interest, between 105.25-15 in Usd/Jpy (1.4 bn) and 1.1835-25 in Eur/Usd (1.1 bn), with the latter also wary about ECB insinuations regarding the strength of the single currency. Back to the Yen, next up the BoJ and in the interim mixed Japanese trade metrics and Suga approved by the lower house as new PM.  GBP/CHF/CAD/SEK - The Pound appears top heavy again above 1.2900 against the Buck and 0.9200 in Euro cross terms as the Brexit implications of the IMB continue to hamper Sterling in addition to formidable technical hurdles in Cable from 1.2933 to 1.2935 (200 WMA/Fib and 55 DMA) and some pre-BoE caution. Elsewhere, the Franc remains stuck in a 0.9100-0.9050 rut, like the Loonie between 1.3200-1.3150 awaiting independent direction from Canadian CPI and the Swedish Krona within 10.4320-10.4035 vs the Euro in wake of Sweden’s ESV fiscal watchdog revising its GDP forecast for this year to show less contraction than envisaged in June, as per other state and private entities.  EM - Apart from the ongoing appreciation of the Yuan and gains fuelled by the depressed Dollar/oil price rebound, pretty mundane midweek session trade awaiting Fed policy pronouncements, guidance, the SEP and chair Powell’s press conference. However, the Lira is still struggling to pare declines from record lows under threat of EU sanctions following a warning from the EP that a resolution to that effect will be on Thursday’s agenda.  In commodities, WTI and Brent front month futures are continuing the grind higher seen during the APAC session as the complex is underpinned by the large surprise drawdown in Private crude inventories (-9.5mln bbls vs. Exp. +1.3mln bbls) alongside developments in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Sally has been upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane as it makes landfall, with the latest update noting that historic and life-threatening flooding is likely through Wednesday along and just inland of the Florida Panhandle. The BSEE estimated Hurricane Sally cut 26.9% of US gulf offshore oil production (prev. 21.4%) and Nat Gas shut off in the region is seen at 28.0% (prev. 25.3%), whilst refining activity is also closely watched due to its vulnerability to flooding, and as just under 54% of US capacity sits in PADD III in the Gulf Coast. Meanwhile, the JMMC gears up to meet tomorrow, with eyes on any commentary regarding oil prices and market outlook. Sources last week said the recent price decline has caused concern in Riyadh, however, not enough to induce panic, and Saudi is planning to keep production steady. “We are likely to see the group once again put pressure on those who are still producing above their quota levels to comply”, ING predicts, with reports also noting that OPEC+ compliance in August stood at 101%. Looking ahead, the weekly EIA crude stocks will be released at the usual time, with the headline expected to show a build of 1.271mln bbls. Elsewhere, precious metals benefit from the softer USD, with spot gold extending gains above USD 1950/oz having had tested the level to the downside in overnight trade. Spot silver holds its head above USD 27.00/oz after printing a base at USD 27.02/oz – with eyes turning to the FOMC decision. In terms of base metals, LME copper erased earlier losses with the aid of a weaker Dollar, whilst Dalian iron ore futures fell overnight amid falling steel margins in China dampening the demand outlook for the base metal.

This is the FOMC’s first meeting since they released their revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy at Jackson Hole, in which they announced the move to a flexible average inflation target, thus allowing inflation to overshoot 2% following a period in which it’s been below target. There was also a change to the wording around their maximum employment objective, now saying that policy will be informed by its “assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level.” Though the change in the strategy opened the door to adjustments in forward guidance and asset purchases at this meeting, the communications from the Fed since then have signalled a lack of urgency on delivering meaningful changes to the policy stance. As a result, our US economists don’t think there’ll be any changes to the Fed’s forward guidance on interest rates, but do see the FOMC reframing their asset purchases as being focused on providing accommodation, rather than aiding market functioning. This meeting will also feature the release of the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, which they think should reflect a meaningful upgrade to the near-term growth and inflation forecasts. On the dot plot, they think there’ll be continued unanimous support on holding the policy rate steady through 2021, with a firm majority still seeing the policy rate at the zero lower bound in 2023. See their full preview here.  Risk assets saw a solid overall performance yesterday ahead of the Fed’s decision, though US markets gave up about half their gains late in the session while remaining up on the day. The S&P 500 finished +0.52% higher for its 3rd consecutive daily advance, but was up as much as +1.1% midday. Tech stocks outperformed again, with the NASDAQ up +1.21%. The market dip from the peaks came around midday NY time, about the same time as a story reported a lack of consensus on US fiscal stimulus - more on that below.  Europe earlier saw solid gains, as the STOXX 600 closed up +0.66%. Banks underperformed on both sides of the Atlantic though and were the worst industries in their respective indices, with the STOXX Banks index down -1.49%, and the S&P 500 banks industry group down -2.48%. Meanwhile oil prices rebounded, with Brent Crude coming off its 3-month low thanks to a +2.32% advance – only the second daily gain in the last ten sessions.  Overnight one interesting story is that the US Federal Trade Commission, which has been investigating Facebook for more than a year over whether the social media giant has harmed competition, could file a case by the end of the year. The news report added however that no final decision has been made on this. Facebook is down -1.86% in overnight trading. Meanwhile, yesterday a Senate Judiciary panel laid out a case for how Google has used its dominance in search and digital advertising to benefit its products and harm competition. This comes ahead of preparations by the Justice Department to sue Google in coming weeks. This is all coming at a time when only 1 in 3 Americans are holding a positive view of Big Tech, as was highlighted by Apjit Walia from my team in a research piece earlier this month. He thinks they’ll come in for increased scrutiny post the election.  Asian markets are largely trading up outside of the Hang Seng (-0.24%) and Shanghai Comp (-0.24%) this morning. The Nikkei (+0.12%), Kospi (+0.27%) and Asx (+1.0%) are all higher along with S&P futures (+0.21%). In FX, the onshore Chinese yuan is up a further +0.15% to 6.7728. Brent crude oil prices are up +1.68% to $41.21. As we go to print, Yoshihide Suga has been elected Japan’s new prime minister by the lower house.  There hasn’t been a great deal of new news on the coronavirus over the last 24 hours, though we did hear from President Trump, who said in a Fox & Friends interview yesterday that “We’re going to have a vaccine in a matter of weeks”. He has doubled down overnight saying that the one would be ready within 3 to 4 weeks. This is going to be an interesting dynamic given there are just seven weeks to the election. The President’s interview came just prior to reports that researchers monitoring the Pfizer vaccine have reported no safety issues after 12,000 patients received a second of two doses. Staying on a vaccine, we also heard from the head of Germany’s vaccine regulator that the first approvals could be granted at the end of this year or early next year. Our latest Exit Strategy Tracker contains the latest on vaccine developments so please see it here.  In terms of case numbers, Western Europe remains a source of concern, with the entire Irish cabinet going into self-isolation yesterday after their Health Minister Donnelly had been tested. Dublin has closed all bars that do not serve food and has asked residents to not have visitors from more than one home come to their house. Elsewhere, both Spain and the UK’s case numbers remained above 3,000, and in Italy a further 1,229 were reported. Here in the UK, the government acknowledged the strain in the country’s testing ability with Health Secretary Hancock telling the House of Commons, “we have seen a sharp rise in the numbers coming forward for a test… we will be able to solve this problem in a matter of weeks.” In the US there were over 50,000 new cases yesterday compared to 26,000 new cases last Tuesday. Summer virus hot spots continue to cool off though, with California and the Houston-area of Texas posting their lowest positivity rates on data going back to April. Elsewhere, confirmed cases in India have reached the 5 million mark as the country is now topping 90k new cases almost on a daily basis. Furthermore, as per Bloomberg, the official counts of confirmed cases and deaths are marred by underreporting and inadequate testing.  While we will hear about any changes to the US monetary policy in a few hours, don’t hold your breath when it comes to fiscal. Congressional leaders met again yesterday to discuss. A follow on stimulus bill has been discussed since July with both parties remaining quite far apart. Yesterday, we heard from White house advisor and the President’s son-in-law Jared Kushner that an agreement may not come until after the election, while Speaker Pelosi threatened to keep the House in session until another fiscal deal is done. Lawmakers in the House are currently expected to recess on 2 October in order to campaign ahead of the 3 November elections. A bipartisan group of 50 lawmakers in the House put a $1.5 trillion bill on the floor that aimed at being a middle ground for both parties with elements of both parties’ original salvos, however leading members in both parties have already said it was both not enough and too much respectively. The concern continues to be that the proximity to the election is causing an apparent lack of political incentive of either side to act.  While this was going on, Sovereign bonds had a mixed performance yesterday ahead of the Fed, with 10yr Treasury yields up +0.7bps, having closed within a 4bps range over the last week. Bund yields were also up but just +0.1bps, though gilts underperformed once again, as 10yr yields rose +2.3bps. Over in commodities, platinum had another strong performance, rising +1.62% for a 5th straight session, while copper fell -0.11% as it came down from its 2-year high the previous day.  Looking at yesterday’s data, US industrial production rose by a below-consensus +0.4% in August (vs. +1.0% expected), though July’s reading was revised up half a percentage point to +3.5%. Meanwhile capacity utilisation rose to 71.4% in August, which is noticeably higher than the 64.1% in April, but still down from the 76.9% back in February. We also got the Empire State manufacturing survey, which rose to 17.0 (vs. 6.9 expected). Here in the UK, the unemployment rate in the 3 months to July rose to 4.1% as expected, which is the first time the jobless rate has been above 4% since October 2018. In addition, the more up-to-date estimates for August 2020 from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information showed the number of payroll employees was down by -695k (or -2.4%) compared with March 2020. Finally, the ZEW survey from Germany showed investor expectations rose to 77.4 in September (vs. 69.5 expected).  To the day ahead now, and the aforementioned Federal Reserve decision will be the highlight of the day for investors. This morning there’s also European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s State of the Union address. Otherwise, we’ll also hear from the ECB’s Hernandez de Cos and Holzmann, and can expect a monetary policy decision from the Brazilian central bank. Data releases from Europe include UK CPI for August and the Euro Area trade balance for July, while the US releases include August retail sales and the September NAHB housing market index."

Stephen Lamar, president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said his industry is working hard to root out products made with forced labor from its supply chains, but Xinjiang, where China has detained over 1 million Muslim Uighurs, represents a unique challenge.  A blanket import ban on all cotton from Xinjiang such as that proposed earlier this month would be impossible to enforce, as would bipartisan legislation banning imports of all products from Xinjiang unless proven free of forced labor, Lamar told a House of Representatives Ways and Means trade subcommittee hearing.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Monday announced five Withhold Release Orders (WROs) banning imports from specific producers of cotton, textiles, apparel, hair products and computer parts in Xinjiang but refrained from proposed broad bans on all cotton and tomatoes from the region.  “Such a WRO or legislation would no doubt make headlines, but they would wreak havoc on human rights, economic development and legitimate supply chains, themselves already battered by COVID-19 all over the world,” Lamar said.  “As a country, we simply do not have the capability or capacity to implement or comply with or enforce a blanket WRO or the proposed legislation right now.”  He said Xinjiang produces about 20% of all cotton consumed in the world, and fibers from the region are often co-mingled with cotton grown in the United State and elsewhere. Xinjiang cotton also is exported to other apparel producing countries, including Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia and there is no technology available to trace cotton origin with reasonable accuracy."

Ambassador Pablo Kang was in a remote province in Cambodia when he sampled a soup made with softshell turtle and eel meat. He deleted his Sept. 10 post praising the dish after environmentalists criticised him.  “I have removed my tweet about soft shell turtles & eels, and apologise to all those who took offence,” Kang said in his tweet. “My intent was not to promote these dishes, but to tell people about some of the foods I was offered during my recent provincial visit.”  “I certainly do not condone the harvesting of any endangered species for food or other purposes, and will be more careful about my actions in future.”  Softshell turtles are under threat across Asia due to habitat loss and egg harvesting, but in Cambodia they are also bred on farms and consuming them is not widely controversial.  The envoy travelled to Pailin, Battambang, Banteay Meanchey and Siem Reap provinces to oversee the Australian government’s COVID-19 response, the Australian Embassy told local media VOD, adding that the envoy does not condone eating endangered turtles.  “During his visit, Ambassador Kang was offered a dish containing soft shell turtle during an official meal. Ambassador Kang tried the dish out of courtesy to his host. He was assured it was farmed,” the embassy said."

Top 10 Little-Known Facts About Color  10 Mummy brown    In the 16th century, a new shade of brown paint started appearing in European art called “Mummy Brown”. You may think this is simply a creative name, but in fact, this paint was actually made of real crushed ancient Egyptians. In the 19th, “Egyptomania” spread across Europe and the United States, as people used mummies as decor, medicine, paper, and even party games at mummy unrolling events.[1] The exact technique for preparing the color varied quite a bit, and today it is almost impossible to tell if a painting used the substance through any kind of analysis, but all of its variations included actual mummy.  But not everyone even knew what the paint was really made of. When one painter, Edward Burnes-Jones, found out the true origins of the material he had been using he held an impromptu funeral for the mummy in his backyard.[2] But much like ancient Egypt itself, the reign of the color had to come to an end. In 1964, the creator of mummy brown paint reported that they had run out of mummies, saying “We might have a few odd limbs lying around somewhere but not enough to make any more paint”.[3] If you want to recreate the shade today, you might have some trouble getting the materials.  9 Vantablack    Vantablack is one of the darkest colors known to mankind. Developed by British company Surrey NanoSystems in the early 2000s, it can absorb 99.965% of visible light.[4] It held the Guinness World Record for darkest man-made substance until a material with a much less catchy name known as “dark chamaleon dimers” knocked it out of the top spot in 2015.[5] It can be used to keep light out of telescopes and infrared cameras and potentially collect solar energy. It may also have military applications, such as intense camouflage.[6]  However, if you use vantablack paint to make a modern art piece or decorate your bedroom, you will probably be out of luck. Unless your name is Anish Kapoor, of course, because he holds the exclusive licensing to use the product in art. Kapoor, who is well-known for creating the bean-shaped “Cloud Gate” sculpture in Chicago, has received sharp criticism for trying to keep an entire color to himself. Fellow artist Stuart Semple hit back by creating several other colors, including “Pinkest Pink”, “Black 2.0”, “Black 3.0”, and “Diamond Dust”, which every single person in the world is allowed to use… except Anish Kapoor.[7] Massachusetts company NanoLab also created a similar substance to Vantablack known as Singularity Black which is available for the public, so if you really want something to be as dark as possible, you can give them a call.[8]      8 Tyrian Purple    Royal purple hues have been associated with nobility for centuries and the connection lingers to this day. During the Roman Empire, any non-noble who dared to try to wear purple could be executed. Queen Elizabeth I forbid anyone but her family from wearing it as part of the Sumptuary Laws that governed what each social class could wear. This reddish-purple was even thought to look similar to dried blood, connecting royals to the idea of a divine bloodline. It became popular among the ruling class in Egypt, Persia, and the Roman Empire and carried through until the mid-1500s.[9]  The reason why purple dye was so rare is that it was incredibly difficult and expensive to produce. The Phoenician city Tyre was the main producer of the dye, which was called Tyrian purple or royal or Imperial purple To extract the pigment, hundreds of thousands of sea snails had to be collected, cracked, and exposed to sunlight (which produced a truly horrible smell). This process required up to 250,000 snails for one ounce of dye, which made it prohibitively expensive for almost everyone,[10] and the snails were only native to the Mediterranean. The clothing made from this dye never faded, and it was literally worth its weight in gold.[11] In 1856, teenage chemist William Henry Perkin accidentally invented a much cheaper purple dye while working on anti-malaria treatment. This new dye, eventually called “mauve”, helped purple become available to everyone.  7 Vermillion    Vermillion is also known by the names cinnabar and China red, but you definitely don’t want to be mixing up any of it at home. Vermillion gets its red-orange hue from mercury, and the smaller the mercury particles are, the brighter red vermillion is. It has been used for close to 8,000 years, since Ancient Romans retrieved it from Spain and used it in cosmetics and art. It was also used to illuminate medieval manuscripts. Prisoners and slaves were given the dangerous job of mining cinnabar in the Spanish mines of Almadén, and it was then heated and crushed to form pigment.[12] It was also used in Renaissance painting and of course in China where it got its alternate name. There it was mixed with tree sap and used for temples, ink, and pottery.[13]  The Ancient Chinese created synthetic cinnabar, but it was still toxic. Eventually Cadmium red replaced it as the choice for artists in the 20th century, as it was much less deadly and didn’t fade into a reddish-brown, as vermillion had the tendency to do.[14] Bright red-orange remains associated with traditional Chinese culture to this day, associated with luck and happiness.      6 Scheele’s green    In the early 1800s, a brand new dye swept the Victorian high society. German color-maker Carl Wilhelm Scheele released a shade of green so vibrant that it became the go-to of ladies attending parties across Western Europe. New gas lamp technology made nighttime events brighter and this emerald green was perfect to make a statement as a modern and fashionable woman. Soon Sheele’s green was seen across Britain in dresses, wallpaper, carpeting, and artificial plants.  Unfortunately, this new dye color was made with copper arsenite, which contained the deadly element arsenic. Women who wore it broke out in blisters. Families started vomiting in their green living rooms. The factory workers who used the dye daily suffered organ failure. One faux flower maker named Matilda Scheurer suffered a gruesome death, throwing up green, the whites of her eyes turning green, and telling others that everything she saw was green.[15] Although people at the time were aware that arsenic was deadly when ingested, the buzz around Sheele’s green helped to spread the idea that the material could kill through other methods of exposure as well.[16] Despite doctors and media quickly figuring out the connection, people resisted the warnings in the name of fashion until 1895.[17]  10 Explanations For The Color Schemes Used On Everyday Things  5 Lead white    As far back as the 4th century B.C., the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians were using this thick white pigment for make-up, medicine, and paint. Ancient Greek authors Pliny and Vestruvious even described it in their writings.[18] The process for making it was fairly simple: soak lead metal in vinegar and then scrape off the white powder that formed. Many manufacturers and artists developed what was called “Painter’s Colic”, which we now recognize as lead poisoning.[19]  Lead white’s thick consistency and fast drying speed made it a favorite of artists across Europe. But lead can enter the body if it is breathed in, ingested, or absorbed and it can cause long-term damage to the brain and kidney.[20] Even though it was clear that this paint was deadly, artists couldn’t find a good match for its creamy warm tones, and it was used until it was formally banned in the 1970s.      4 Uranium orange    In 1936, the Fiestaware ceramics company started to come out with a bright new line of dinnerware. A bold orange-red color called “Fiesta Red”, these dishes started appearing in homes across America. The bright color came from uranium oxide, which is radioactive. From 1943 to 1959, the production of these orange dishes paused, as uranium was banned from civilian use to save it for the war effort. When they started production again, a different form of uranium was used, called depleted uranium, which is slightly less radioactive than the natural form.[21]  Many dishes from the time period used radioactive materials in their production, and the EPA warns that they can now emit alpha, beta, and gamma radiation.[22] Fiesta red dishes were produced until 1972, when the line was discontinued, but this line is still highly sought after by collectors, although it is recommended that you don’t actually eat off them, especially acidic food.[23] Fiestaware still makes dinnerware, although the colors will not match the old ones due to the fact that they no longer use uranium or lead in their glazes.  3 Radium green    In 1908, a very unique paint appeared. It was self-luminous and glowed a bright green in the dark, which was perfect for watches and compasses that could now be used at night. Radium appeared all over the market in the late 1800s to early 1900s, used in drinks, candy, creams and lotions, soap, spas, and swimming pools. The glowing, fizzling radium became connected with the idea of a healthy glow.[24] The watches were first used for the military in World War I, and after the war, they began to spread to consumers.  A group of young women and girls worked in the factories painting watch faces, later known as “the Radium Girls”, and it was considered an artistic job with access to this fun, newly discovered substance. The girls licked their paint brushes to give them a fine point and also sprinkled the dye on their fair and face so they would glow in the dark at parties. In the 1920s, the girls started to show signs of radiation poisoning. They developed sores, rotted jaws and teeth, and several died before the problem started to be understood. In 1928, Grace Fryer led her fellow workers in suing the New Jersey factory, causing a media frenzy. The girls won.[25] Many of the surviving girls also agreed to be studied in the 1950s, and the U.S. vastly expanded their understanding of the effects of radium on the body. Radium paint for watches officially stopped being used in 1968. Glow-in-the-dark products today are most often made with photoluminesce, where they absorb and then re-emit light, which is not toxic.[26]      2 Red-green and blue-yellow    These two colors are not forbidden by any ruler or made of some deadly material. The problem with these colors is that they are almost impossible to see. Red and green cancel each other out inside of the human eye and blue and yellow do as well. The retinas of the human eye allow us to take incoming light and make specific neuron fire in the brain to recognize each color. But these pairs of colors inhibit each other in the brain, so they cannot be viewed simultaneously.  Until 1983, when scientists Hewitt Crane and Thomas Piantanida conducted an experiment. Volunteers were shown adjacent stripes of yellow/blue or red/green. Each eye was forced to focus on a single color using an eye tracker. By doing this, their eyes were tricked into slowly blending the colors and creating a new shade.[27] Participants reportedly had trouble describing this, as no words existed for these colors. When a repeat study was done in 2006 by Dartmouth University and scientist Po-Jang Hsieh, volunteers were given a color mapper to try and match the impossible colors that they saw, and some chose a brownish color referred to as “mud” for the red-green combination.[28]  1 Gamboge yellow    In the 1600s, the British East India Company brought back a new bright yellow pigment from Asia. Gamboge was named after the country of Cambodia, which used to be called “Camoboja” from the Latin word “gambogium” meaning pigment. It was collected as sap from bamboo shoots of trees at least ten years and then turned into fine powder or hard rocks that could be wet to paint with. This sap was poisonous itself, but that was not the only reason that gamboge became unpopular. The color was used in traditional Chinese painting, but the color faded fast and can be hard to recognize today.[29]  In the mid-1800s in England, a snake oil salesman named James Morrison came out with “Morrison’s vegetable pills” made of gamboge, which acted as a strong diuretic and laxative. Doctors quickly realized that gamboge irritated the skin and could be deadly as medicine in even small amounts. Also in 1980s, a Winsor & Newton paint company employee found a bullet in a piece of gamboge, and it was quickly discovered that it had been collected from the killing fields of the Khmer Rouge.[30] In 2005, Winsor & Newton stopped using Gamboge and replaced it with a non-toxic version called “New Gamboge”.[31]  10 Moments That Changed Color Forever"

It has decided to open its 50th store at Connaught Place in New Delhi, which is also the brand’s largest outlet in the country.  Online sales  The expansion of the retail footprint also comes at a time when the brand, which entered the country in 2015, has seen a significant spike in sales through the online channel, as consumers remain cautious about venturing out to shop.  Rajat Khurana, Managing Director, ASICS India and South Asia, said: “We have additional five stores in the pipeline that we expect to open in the October-December period, and we hope to end this calendar year with 55 stores. In 2021, we hope to have a stronger growth momentum, and will look to open one store per month with plans to add 12-15 stores.” The company's stores are run by its franchise partners.  Khurana said after nearly 200days of challenging period for the industry, all the stores of the brand are now operational as economic activity has gradually resumed in the country. “We have seen a substantial jump in sales through the e-commerce channels, which includes our own website. With the pandemic, consumers are increasingly becoming more conscious about health and fitness and, hence, we are witnessing good traction for our sports performance product portfolio,” he added.  The company expects the online channel to contribute over 35 per cent to the overall sales in this year. “While there has been an exponential growth in online sales, which is expected to further accelerate next year, expansion of the retail store footprint will remain a critical part of the brand's growth strategy in the country,” said Khurana. While footfalls at retail stores remain lower than the pre-Covid levels, conversions are stronger, he added.  Make-in-India project  Footwear is among the key sectors identified by the government for make-in-India and self-reliant India initiatives. Khurana said that ASICS has been ramping up local sourcing, especially in the apparel sector, and that the company has also begun exporting products from India. “Entry-level footwear product range is also being made in India. But for high-end technologically-driven footwear products, we still rely on imports from countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia.” he added."

He is also batting for a free trade agreement between the quad nations (US, Japan, Australia and India). In an interview to Mint, Aghi spoke of the recovery post covid-19, supply-chain realignments and why business imperatives could triumph political rhetoric around protectionism. Excerpts:  How do you see the post-covid recovery trajectory of both the countries?  There are broad differences in the recovery cycle between India and the US. We feel that the US will have a V-shaped recovery because the cost of capital is very low. Two, there is an abundance of stimulus money coming into the market for the businesses. When we look at India, our prediction is that it won’t be a V-shaped recovery. It is going to be more of a U-shaped one, where the economy is going to be flat for the next 12-18 months because there has not been enough stimulus both from a demand-side or from the supply-side. India is also not an export-oriented GDP; it is still an internal consumption GDP. Unless you get the demand pick-up, the supply-side will not invest. India is caught in a vicious cycle here. But we are seeing some green shoots, especially in the rural economy.  Where is the Indo-US economic relationship headed, considering that both the countries seem to have slipped into protectionism with visa curbs in the US and the narrative around self-reliance in India?  I won’t say that both countries have gone protectionist. H-1B (visa) is more of a political issue. The US has a shortage of over a million software engineers—US companies need these workers (on H-1B ) to make them more efficient, to make them more competitive and to make them more innovative. From the business side, there is a growing demand for these workers.On Atmanirbhar Bharat , we don’t see it as protectionist. It is like the '60s when India wanted to become self sufficient in food so the green revolution took place. I think the effort is to bring in self sustainability in critical items. Let’s talk about healthcare. India supplies about 40% of the US generic drug consumption. About 70% of the APIs come in from China and in certain cases, 100% of the APIs. India feels exposed there, so does the US. There is an effort by the two countries to shift the supply-chain.  Yes, in a small number of cases, there is the impact of duties. But overall, the US government is supportive of the supply-chain shifting from China into India or other countries.  It appears that other Asian countries are better placed to seize the opportunity on the supply-chain realignments …  You are right. Countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and even Bangladesh could benefit from the shift from China. I think this is an opportunity for India to usher in further reforms. Unless you are integrated into the global economy, you cannot be a global economic power. Those reforms are needed to compete with countries like Vietnam. The reason I say Vietnam is because there is an FTA with India—companies are saying let’s move manufacturing to Vietnam and you can still move goods duty-free into India. It is a catch-22 for India.

The University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (UTCC) said yesterday business confidence rose to 32.6 in August from 31.8 in July and 31.5 in June, which was the first increase in 14 months.  This followed readings of 31.3 in May, 32.1 in April, 37.5 in March, 44.9 in February and 45.4 in January.  The May figure was a 29-month low dating to January 2018.  Thanavath Phonvichai, UTCC president, said higher business sentiment stemmed largely from the easing of the outbreak, the relaxation of rigid lockdown measures, higher crop prices for oil palm, rubber, rice and maize, and rising sales of agricultural machines, pickups, electrical appliances and mobile phones.  Retail sales also picked up, all positive signs of a gradual economic recovery, said Mr Thanavath.  ""Business people agree the economy bottomed out in the second quarter,"" he said.  ""They are bullish on the economy getting better thanks to the government's myriad stimulus measures covering tourism and job creation.""  The National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) said on Sept 9 the second phase of the state's 400-billion-baht spending plan for social and economic rehabilitation is set to finance new projects aimed at strengthening the farming sector and creating more jobs.  The second phase worth 90-100 billion baht aims at revitalising the economy in the final three months this year and the first quarter next year, focusing on job creation, boosting tourism, and upskilling and reskilling programmes for workers in automotive, digital, automation and other targeted industries.  The cabinet in July approved a budget allocation of 92.4 billion baht for the first phase of the plan, expected to create 410,000 jobs.  The cabinet approved 45.1 billion baht to finance 69 projects in the first phase, with the remaining 47.3 billion scheduled for cabinet approval this month.  The remaining funds in the first phase are allotted mainly for hiring 60,000 university students or/and unemployed persons to conduct surveys and data analysis for village and large-scale farm project development.  However, Mr Thanavath said the private sector remains concerned about overall economic prospects after the NESDC reported last month the GDP shrank 12.2% year-on-year in the second quarter, the biggest contraction since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98.  A sharp decline prompted the government's planning unit to downgrade the economic outlook for the whole year to a 7.3%-7.8% contraction from an earlier contraction of 5%-6%.  It also cut the projection for the export value of goods, private consumption expenditure and total investment to -10%, -3.1% and -5.8%, respectively, from earlier estimates of -8%, -1.7% and -2.1% made on May 18.  The business sector also proposed the government beef up promoting border trade with neighbouring countries to capitalise on rising investment in Cambodia and Laos.  Companies want the government to come up with more measures to stimulate domestic tourism such as additional long holidays and a tax break, while encouraging more seminars to be held in provinces to stimulate tourism and spending on weekdays, he said."

During the celebrations, Buddhism followers go to pagodas and make offerings to monks in order to dedicate to their relatives and loved ones who had passed away.  Buddhists believe that everything they offer to the monks will reach their dead ancestors or relatives and in return, the dead will bless them with good luck.  Buddhists account for over 90 percent of the kingdom's population of more than 15 million, according to the Ministry of Cults and Religions.  Health Ministry's secretary of state and spokeswoman Or Vandine on Wednesday urged the pagoda goers to remain cautious about COVID-19 although the virus is under control in the kingdom.  ""On behalf of the Ministry of Health, I'd like to call on all people, including monks and nuns at pagodas, to keep on following prevention measures set out by the ministry in order to prevent COVID-19 from spreading to communities,"" she said.  The festival goers should wear face masks, wash hands with alcohol frequently and keep social distancing, Vandine said.  According to the spokeswoman, the Southeast Asian nation has recorded a total of 275 confirmed COVID-19 cases to date, with no deaths and 274 patients cured."

When a subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee convened virtually on Thursday to look at how the U.S. should enforce the ban on imports produced by forced labor, there was broad condemnation of the treatment of the Uyghur Muslim minority in China’s Xinjiang province.  Finding an unusual amount of common ground for Washington, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, activists, a union representative and a key fashion lobbyist all railed against conditions in Xinjiang, which produces about 20 percent of the world’s cotton.  While activists pushed broadly for a blanket ban on goods made in the far Western province, saying it is impossible to ensure exports from the province weren’t made with forced labor, the fashion industry has pushed for coordinated government-to-government interaction, while stressing the difficulty of ensuring cotton in the supply chain comes from elsewhere.  But all argued for more action — the need for which was laid bare in the testimony of Rushan Abbas, founder and executive director of the Campaign for Uyghurs.  “At present, upward of 3 million Uyghurs are languishing in concentration camps set up by the Chinese regime in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, referred to by Uyghurs by its historic name, East Turkistan,” Abbas said. “Millions more are being used as forced labor in factories and farms throughout the region, and even across China. While the existence of these camps was initially denied by the Chinese authorities, the narrative given by the regime has shifted to admit their existence, but to define them as ‘vocational training centers.’ Now the Chinese Communist Party leaders have shifted to label an entire group of people in need of ‘reeducation’ in order to be in line with Chinese socialism as Xi Jin Ping defines it. It is genocide.”  View Gallery Related Gallery The 8 Biggest Spring 2021 Fashion Trends From European Fashion Weeks  She said her sister, a retired medical doctor, lived a quiet life as a law-abiding citizen and was not particularly religious or political, but disappeared just over two years ago, shortly after Abbas spoke out against the treatment of the Uyghurs.  “She was taken in retaliation for my activism here, as an American, and since that time I have had no news of her,” Abbas said. “Her own children were not told why she was detained, which camp she is held in, or how her current health is.…We wonder if she is being forced to make the clothing and shoes that adorn the bodies of our countrymen. I am wracked with guilt that using my freedom of speech and a democratic platform resulted in punishment for her, but this is the situation for millions of Uyghurs, and every Uyghur in diaspora has to weigh the choice of silence versus speaking out with the risk of losing family.”  Steve Lamar, president and chief executive officer of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said fashion has “zero tolerance for forced labor” and that “the situation in the XUAR is grave and unprecedented. The Chinese government is engaging in a widespread campaign to repress and exploit Uighur and other ethnicities using many tactics, including forced and prison labor. This is intolerable. Our country and the world must unite to stop it.”  While the U.S. government recently moved to ban imports from certain operators via withhold release orders impacting imports at the border, Lamar pointed to rumors of a blanket ban that would declare all cotton from the region as made with forced labor.  “Such a [withhold release order] would no doubt make headlines, but it would wreak unending havoc to human rights, economic development and legitimate supply chains — which are already battered by COVID-19 — all over the world,” he said.  Lamar said cotton from the region could make its way into yarns and fabrics in countries as far flung as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Haiti.  “As a country, we simply do not have the capability or capacity to implement, comply with, or enforce a blanket WRO,” he said.  But Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, testified that the problems are so severe that the only way brands can ensure they are not using forced labor is to “end all sourcing from the Uyghur Region, from cotton to finished goods,” which includes the more than 2 billion pieces of apparel that are cleared through U.S. ports each year.  “Apparel brands have no ability to keep the farms and factories they use free of forced labor,” Nova said.  He argued that brands are able to track the origins of the raw materials they use, pointing out that they regularly certify where their supplies come from to adhere to trade agreements.  Even so, a ban on one-fifth of the world’s cotton supply would be a massive undertaking.  “If a ban is enacted, through legislation or a region-wide WRO, enforcement will be complicated by the fact that almost none of the apparel with Uyghur Region content is shipped to the U.S. from the Uyghur Region,” Nova said. “ It comes instead from sewing factories, across China and around the world, that use fabric fashioned from Uyghur Region cotton and yarn. Unless seeking preferential tariff treatment, brands disclose nothing about the origins of cotton and yarn in their clothes. Effective enforcement by [Customs and Border Protection] will require robust independent methods to verify the source of cotton and yarn in imported garments, backed up by thorough public reporting.”  The committee is currently in fact-finding mode and working to craft U.S. policy to address the issue."

Rappers Kea Sokun and Long Puthera were arrested this month in Siem Reap province after releasing songs criticizing the Cambodian government’s handling of its border dispute with Vietnam and suggesting that Hun Sen’s lack of leadership had led to Cambodia’s economic decline.    They are now being held awaiting trial on charges of “incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest” under Article 495 of Cambodia’s Penal Code, Siem Reap Provincial Court spokesman Chhuon Sophana told RFA on Tuesday.    Cambodian NGOs have now sent or requested lawyers to defend the pair, with Am Sam Ath—deputy director of the rights group Licadho—saying the two rappers had only voiced their views and had not committed any crime.    “They had simply expressed their views through music, which was not a case of incitement. Their arrest is a violation of their basic rights,” he said.    Licadho is sending a lawyer to defend Kea Sokun, while the group Legal Aid of Cambodia will represent Long Puthera. Chan Chamroeun, Siem Reap provincial coordinator for the rights group Adhoc, said that he has also asked for lawyers who will request the pair be freed on bail.    Phum Bunphann, a Siem Reap lawyer working for Hun Sen’s team of legal volunteers, meanwhile told RFA on Thursday that he cannot defend the pair, saying he can provide services only “to the poor, to vulnerable women, and to women facing issues with the law.”    “We help the poor, but we can’t help everyone. Clients must meet certain criteria,” he said.    Flu spreads in prisons    The rappers’ arrests—part of a sweep against youth activists, labor unionists, and environmentalists—come as Cambodian NGOs have voiced concern over inmates’ health amid a severe influenza outbreak in the country’s overcrowded prisons, with Adhoc member and former prisoner Ny Sokha urging Cambodia’s Ministry of Health to take immediate action to stop the further spread of the disease.    “The Prison Department should distance inmates from each other according to instructions from the Ministry of Health. When I was in prison, we had skin diseases and could easily spread infections from one person to another,” he said.    Ministry of Health spokesman Ly Sovann confirmed to RFA that severe influenza is spreading rapidly in the prisons, while a Ministry statement on Sept. 16 said the flu is spreading in jails, pagodas, and villages in the provinces of Takeo, Preah Vihear, Koh Kong, Battambang, and Banteay Meanchey.    Though many monks fell ill last week, none tested positive for COVID-19, Sy Lovann said, adding that the flu is now spreading more quickly during the rainy season.    Nuth Savana, spokesman for the Prison Department, meanwhile said outbreaks have occurred in three prisons in Koh Kong, Kampong Cham, and Preah Vihear. He provided no details on how many inmates are now infected, but said that the department is working closely with health officials to prevent a further spread.    “We are handling this with the same procedures that we use for Covid-19. We have also given the prisoners pills, and they are getting better,” he said.    New wave of arrests    The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said last week that it had documented the arrest of 24 human rights campaigners since popular labor leader Rong Chhun, the president of the Cambodian Confederation of Unions, was taken into custody July 31, including eight in September alone.    The wave of arrests come three years after opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) president Kem Sokha’s September 2017 arrest over an alleged plot to overthrow the government with the help of Washington. Cambodia’s Supreme Court banned his party in November that year for its supposed role in the scheme.    The move to dissolve the CNRP marked the beginning of a wider crackdown by Hun Sen on the political opposition, NGOs, and the independent media that paved the way for his ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats in parliament in the country’s July 2018 general election.

Airlines will be responsible for confirming whether passengers test negative for Covid-19 within three days before boarding flights in their host countries.  Foreign passengers must have their body temperatures checked and install Bluezone, a Vietnamese Bluetooth-based app that helps determine if a person has come into close contact with a Covid-19 patient, before boarding flights, the ministry stressed.  The government has allowed commercial flights to mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan from September 15, followed by Laos, Cambodia to reopen from September 22, the Government Office said Tuesday evening.  However, the transport ministry said relevant authorities are working to determine Covid-19 testing procedures and quarantine expenses as well as sufficient quarantine facilities and medical staff before welcoming foreign passengers.  After reaching a conclusion, the transport ministry would allow airlines to release specific flight schedules.  So far, Vietnamese carriers have yet to reveal specific plans for two-way commercial flights to the six Asian destinations.  Under the government’s decision, passengers allowed entry include Vietnamese citizens, foreigners carrying diplomatic and official passports, experts, business managers, high-skilled workers, investors, and their family members, as well as international students and family members of Vietnamese citizens.  Vietnam suspended all international flights on March 25. Many foreigners who have been kept out of the country due to travel restrictions have pleaded with the government to reopen the borders and resume international flights so they could reunite with their families.  Upon landing in Vietnam, arrivals would be tested again via the RT-PRC method at centralized quarantine camps.  The quarantine period for those who test negative twice would be reduced from 14 to five days, following which they have to remain at their place of accommodation or work until the 14 days are up, under supervision of local authorities. Those showing signs of infection will have to remain at specified centralized quarantine facilities.  Under the transport ministry's proposal, there would be two weekly round trips on the HCMC-Guangzhou route, two weekly services on the Hanoi-Tokyo and HCMC-Tokyo routes, as well as four trips from Hanoi and HCMC to Seoul, along with four weekly trips to Taipei.  Vietnam's Covid-19 count is currently at 1,063, including 89 active cases. It has gone two weeks without a new domestic infection."

The company is one of the most highly-valued tech startups in Southeast Asia, where it operates in eight countries. Its transport business suffered a sharp decline in March and April, as movement restriction orders were implemented.  But the company had the advantage of already operating several on-demand logistics services. During Disrupt, Russell Cohen, Grab’s group managing director of operations, talked about how the company adapted its technology for an unprecedented crisis (the video is embedded below).  “We sat down as a leadership group at the start of the crisis and we could see, particularly in Southeast Asia, that the scale of the challenge was so immense,” said Cohen.  Grab’s driver app already allowed them to toggle between ride-hailing and on-demand delivery requests. As a result of COVID-19, more than 149,000 drivers began performing on-demand deliveries for the first time, with Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand seeing the most conversions. That number included tens of thousands of new drivers who joined the platform to make up for lost earnings during the pandemic.  The challenge was scaling up its delivery services to meet the dramatic increase in demand by consumers, and also merchants who needed a new way to reach customers. In March and April, Cohen said just under 80,000 small businesses joined its platform. Many had never sold online before, so Grab expedited the release of a self-service feature, making it easier for merchants to on-board themselves.  “This is a massive sector of the Southeast Asian economy that effectively digitized within a matter of weeks,” said Cohen.  A lot of the new merchants had previously taken only cash payments, so Grab had to set them up for digital payments, a process made simpler because the company’s financial unit, Grab Financial, already offers services like Grab Pay for cashless payments, mobile wallets and remittance services.  Grab also released a new package of tools called Grab Merchant, which enabled merchants to set up online businesses by submitting licenses and certification online, and includes features like data analytics.  Modeling for uncertainty in the “new normal”  Part of Grab’s COVID-19 strategy involved collaborating with local municipalities and governments in different countries to make deliveries more efficient. For example, it worked with the Singaporean government to expand a pilot program, called GrabExpress Car, originally launched in September, that enabled more of Grab’s ride-hailing vehicles to be used for food and grocery deliveries. Previously, many of those deliveries were handled only by motorbikes.  The situation in each of Grab’s markets — Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam — is still evolving. Some markets have lifted lockdown orders, while others continue to cope with new outbreaks.  Cohen said ride-hailing is gradually recovering in many of Grab’s markets. But the company is preparing for an uncertain future by modeling different scenarios, taking into account potential re-closings, and long-lasting changes in both consumer and merchant behavior.  “Unpredictability is something we think a lot about,” Cohen said. Its models include ones where deliveries are a significantly larger part of its business, because even in countries where movement restrictions have been lifted, customers still prefer to shop online.  COVID-19 has also accelerated the adoption of digital payments in several of Grab’s markets. For example, Grab launched its GrabPay Card in the Philippines three months ago, because more people are beginning to use contactless payments in response to COVID-19 concerns.  In terms of on-demand deliveries, the company is expanding GrabExpress, its same-day courier service, and adapting technology originally created for ride-pooling to help drivers plan pickups and deliveries more efficiently. This will help decrease the cost of delivery services as consumers remain price-conscious because of the pandemic’s economic impact.  “Purchasing behaviors have changed, so for us, when we think about the supply side, the drivers’ side, that means we’ve got to make sure our fleet is flexible,” he said."

Stephen Lamar, president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said his industry is working hard to root out products made with forced labor from its supply chains, but Xinjiang, where China has detained over 1 million Muslim Uighurs, represents a unique challenge.  A blanket import ban on all cotton from Xinjiang such as that proposed earlier this month would be impossible to enforce, as would bipartisan legislation banning imports of all products from Xinjiang unless proven free of forced labor, Lamar told a House of Representatives Ways and Means trade subcommittee hearing.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Monday announced five Withhold Release Orders (WROs) banning imports from specific producers of cotton, textiles, apparel, hair products and computer parts in Xinjiang but refrained from proposed broad bans on all cotton and tomatoes from the region.

""As a country, we simply do not have the capability or capacity to implement or comply with or enforce a blanket WRO or the proposed legislation right now.""  He said Xinjiang produces about 20% of all cotton consumed in the world, and fibers from the region are often co-mingled with cotton grown in the United State and elsewhere.

China’s Xinjiang has been put under the spotlight in recent months, with the US accusing Beijing of human rights violations in the region and oppressing the local Uighur population. The US Commerce Department has added dozens of Chinese entities onto its black list for involvement in alleged abuses, which Beijing has repeatedly denied.

Advertisement  The coronavirus pandemic is taking a turn for the worse in Southeast Asia. As total COVID-19 cases pass 30 million, and the world closes in on its millionth death from the contagion, a region once viewed as a success story is seeing persistent and accelerating infections in several nations, including the region’s two most populous.  In Indonesia, the Ministry of Health announced that September 17 saw a daily 3,963 new cases and 122 additional deaths, three days after authorities put the capital Jakarta into a second period of lockdown. This brought Indonesia’s total to 232,628 cases with a death toll of 9,222, the highest in the region.  Much of this can be put down to the threadbare, unscientific approach that the administration of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has taken to battling the contagion. In recent months, members of Jokowi’s cabinet have peddled a range of bogus cures for COVID-19, from prayer to mangosteen juice to necklaces made of eucalyptus leaves. At the same time, an August investigation by Reuters found that Indonesia’s rate of testing was among the world’s lowest, and that its contact tracing was minimal.  The lackluster response has put Jokowi’s administration at loggerheads with regional leaders who fear that the rising number of infections could overwhelm the nation’s under-resourced health system. In announcing the new lockdown measures in Jakarta, Governor Anies Baswedan warned that without the renewed restrictions, hospitals would soon reach full capacity in the capital, where new cases have averaged 1,000 per day over the past month. “There are not many options for Jakarta, except to pull the emergency brake as soon as possible,” Baswedan told a press conference.

At the beginning of September, Abdul Kadir, the director-general of Indonesia’s Ministry of Health, warned against reimposing a lockdown, saying it would push Indonesia into economic recession.

A similarly lackadaisical approach has been taken by the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte, which in mid-August overtook Indonesia as the worst-affected nation in Southeast Asia, in terms of total cases. On September 17, the Philippine health authorities announced 3,375 new coronavirus infections and 53 additional deaths, bringing these totals to 276,289 and 4,785, respectively. Local media reported today that 78 positive COVID-19 cases have so far been identified among staff at the nation’s parliament.  The other worrying case is Myanmar, which saw low community transmission until infections began to spiral upwards about a month ago. On September 18, the country’s health ministry announced 404 new cases along with 15 more COVID-19 linked deaths. The nation’s tallies now stand at 4,299 cases and 61 deaths, but military medics have predicted that 16,000 people could be infected with COVID-19 by the end of September if the virus continues spreading at its current rate.  The upsurge has coincided with the early phase of campaigning for Myanmar’s upcoming national election on November 8, prompting opposition parties to call for the polls to be postponed. The Union Election Commission ruled on September 14 that the election will go ahead as planned with COVID-19-related protocols in place – but that could conceivably change if things continue to worsen.  Advertisement  At the same time, Southeast Asia continues to provide some bright spots in the global fight against coronavirus. After a minor flare-up in late July and early August, Vietnam has reestablished control on the contagion. Where the Philippines has had more than 260,000 cases, Vietnam, which has a population roughly the same size, has reported just over 1,000. Infection rates continue to be low in Cambodia and Laos, while Thailand recently clocked up 100 days without a community infection, before an imported case ended its golden run earlier this month."

Xinjiang cotton also is exported to other apparel producing countries, including Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia and there is no technology available to trace cotton origin with reasonable accuracy."

Although the matter is already before the Senate Joint Committee, Mustapha admitted that it would be out of place to use public funds to conduct COVID-19 test for travellers as such is not provided in the 2020 budget.  Mustapha, who is the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, estimated the figures of persons that travel out of the country at about six million yearly.  He also stated that it costs the country at N13 billion to obtain one million test kits.  ""If you calculate that money, it is a huge amount of money and it is a matter of balance. Do we want to pass this huge expense to the public purses? Travels are leisure and private; we must share the responsibility as it is the common global practice. I don't think the commonwealth of Nigeria should be used for that purpose.  ""If you go the UK today and you want a test, you will pay for it. It is £250. It is $360 in Iceland; $206 in Austria and $165 in Cambodia. Several countries have set their own requirements for tests. What is provided in the budget is what will be used for the National Response. The Senate Joint Committee appreciates that and said they will engage with the ministries and the FCTA to see how they can provide responses in the 2021 budget,"" Mustapha said.  Meanwhile, the National Coordinator on COVID-19, Dr. Sani Aliyu has said that children below the age of 10 have been excluded from undergoing PCR test if they do not require the test outside country.  While speaking at yesterday's PTF briefing, Aliyu, however, said the exemption does not apply to foreign diplomats who are required to present their PCR Negative results at the airport and the second test seven days after arriving at the country.  Aliyu also warned against rush in the reopening of the airports because of the risk of escalation is high."

Stephen Lamar, president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said his industry is working hard to root out products made with forced labor from its supply chains, but Xinjiang, where China has detained over 1 million Muslim Uighurs, represents a unique challenge.  Advertisement  Advertisement  A blanket import ban on all cotton from Xinjiang such as that proposed earlier this month would be impossible to enforce, as would bipartisan legislation banning imports of all products from Xinjiang unless proven free of forced labor, Lamar told a House of Representatives Ways and Means trade subcommittee hearing.  US Customs and Border Protection on Monday announced five Withhold Release Orders (WROs) banning imports from specific producers of cotton, textiles, apparel, hair products and computer parts in Xinjiang but refrained from proposed broad bans on all cotton and tomatoes from the region.  ""Such a WRO or legislation would no doubt make headlines, but they would wreak havoc on human rights, economic development and legitimate supply chains, themselves already battered by COVID-19 all over the world,"" Lamar said.

He said Xinjiang produces about 20 per cent of all cotton consumed in the world, and fibers from the region are often co-mingled with cotton grown in the United State and elsewhere. Xinjiang cotton also is exported to other apparel producing countries, including Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia and there is no technology available to trace cotton origin with reasonable accuracy.

Liu Lujun, deputy secretary-general of the CNIE, said that China's poverty reduction endeavor has not only satisfied the Chinese people's aspirations for a better life but also boosted the achievement of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as the development of global human rights governance.  China's achievements in poverty alleviation have demonstrated the remarkable strengths of the Communist Party of China leadership and socialism with Chinese characteristics, and offered Chinese wisdom and approaches to global poverty reduction, said Tan Weiping, deputy head of the International Poverty Reduction Center in China.

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.  The government has approved the Ministry of Finance’s recommendation that a person has to pay VND80,000 for food and VND40,000 for other daily necessities.  Since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out last January, the government has quarantined people arriving in the country at its facilities or military camps for 14 days, but for free before September 1.  Those preferring to quarantine themselves at hotels and resorts have to pay VND1.2-5 million a day in Hanoi and HCMC.  The government has also mandated that all foreigners arriving in the country need to have international medical insurance that will bear all the medical and other expenses if they contract the disease in Vietnam.  They have to pay for Covid-19 tests while Vietnamese will continue to receive free check-ups and treatment.  They also need to register accommodation address before booking flights to Vietnam.  The government has allowed the resumption of commercial air services to mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan from September 15, and to Laos and Cambodia on September 22.  But Vietnamese carriers have yet to reveal specific plans for two-way commercial flights to the six Asian destinations as relevant authorities are working to finalize Covid-19 testing procedures as well as sufficient quarantine facilities and medical staff before welcoming foreign passengers.  For the moment, the only foreigners to be allowed are those with diplomatic and official passports, experts, business managers, high-skilled workers, and investors, their family members, international students, and family members of Vietnamese citizens.  On landing, people must furnish a certificate confirming they tested negative for Covid-19 within three days before boarding the flight, but will be taken to quarantine camps first and tested further using the RT-PRC method. People who are tested negative for the coronavirus twice can leave the camps after five days and be quarantined at other facilities like their home, workplace or hotels to finish the 14-day isolation under the Health Ministry protocols.  Vietnam suspended all international flights on March 25.  Many foreigners who have been locked out of the country due to travel bans have pleaded with the government to reopen the borders and resume international flights so that they could reunite with their families.  Vietnam has had 1,066 Covid-19 cases so far, 88 of them active, including 35 deaths.  There has been no community transmission for two weeks."
